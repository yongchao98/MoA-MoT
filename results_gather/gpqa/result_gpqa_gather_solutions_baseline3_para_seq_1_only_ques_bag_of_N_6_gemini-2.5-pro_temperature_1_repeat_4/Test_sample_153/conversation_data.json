Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1), is a distinctive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance), which results in this characteristic peak ratio.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly indicates the presence of an O-H bond involved in hydrogen bonding. The extreme broadness is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **D) Phenyl chloroformate**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet (s) integrating to one proton (1H). Its chemical shift is far downfield, which is highly characteristic of an acidic proton from a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   They are both doublets (d), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   They each integrate to two protons (2H), for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring. This substitution pattern creates a high degree of symmetry, where the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with three distinct aromatic signals, not two doublets. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl), which matches the MS data.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution:** It has a para- (1,4-) substitution pattern, which perfectly explains the ¹H NMR signals (two doublets of 2H each). The carboxylic acid proton explains the singlet at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho- (1,2-) disubstituted ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons and a much more complex ¹H NMR splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid, and is inconsistent with the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most common isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula of the options. All proposed structures (A, B, C, D) are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Nominal Mass Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This confirms that all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid derivative without an O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the O-H peak is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We see two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm): 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (like -COOH and -Cl), there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are identical, and they couple with their neighbors, creating a doublet. The same applies to the other pair of protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The aromatic substitution pattern is *para*.\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It would show a more complex pattern for its 4 distinct aromatic protons.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed \"two doublets of 2H each\" signal. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the -Cl atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   MS shows a molecule with formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and establishes a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only option that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This pattern is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The molecular weight using the ³⁷Cl isotope is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158. All four options have this formula, so the MS data is consistent with any of them.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence allows us to eliminate option B (an aldehyde and a phenol) and option C (a chloroformate, which is an acid chloride derivative and would lack the broad O-H peak). We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm.\n        *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), which is consistent with a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   The splitting pattern is crucial. We see two doublets. This symmetric pattern is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Option A, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,4-disubstituted ring and would produce this exact two-doublet pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at 7.72 ppm.\n        *   Option D, **2-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring. This structure lacks the symmetry of the para isomer. It would have four chemically distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, the para substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the data provided.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak, has a relative abundance of about 32% (100% for 156, 32% for 158). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single **chlorine atom** in the molecule. (Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of ~75% and ~25%, respectively).\n\nSo, we are looking for a chlorine-containing compound with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl). My calculation confirmed all four options have the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and molecular weight to match the mass spectrometry data. Therefore, we must rely on the other spectra to distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nThis IR evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (an aldehyde/phenol) and C (a chloroformate), which would not show the broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (highly deshielded) is typical for an acidic proton. A chemical shift around 10-13 ppm is classic for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each integrating to two protons (2H). Each signal is a doublet ('d'), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. In such a ring, there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly the symmetrical pattern observed: two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2- (ortho) substituted benzene ring. This structure is not symmetrical and would have four unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct multiplets), not two clean doublets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   **MS** tells us the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring structure.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures, assuming one chlorine atom. The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 35.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 156.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 37.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 158.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 158.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is right in the range for a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (chloroformate), as they would not have the characteristic broad O-H peak of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (highly deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid exchange and no adjacent protons) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para*- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   This pattern eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B), which is *ortho*-disubstituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons.\n        *   This pattern perfectly matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C). The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid proton and indicates a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with about one-third the intensity (32%) is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing a single chlorine atom. The Python script confirmed that the molecular weight for 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂) is indeed 156 amu, and for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂, it is 158 amu.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The combination of a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid) and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (a C=O stretch) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H is the signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), each integrating to 2H, indicate a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern results in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPutting all the evidence together, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom attached. The NMR spectrum specifically points to a *para* substitution pattern. Therefore, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The relative abundance of this peak is about 32% that of the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (Natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (with ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for the proposed structures to see if they match. The general formula is CₓHᵧClO₂.\nFor C₇H₅ClO₂, the mass would be:\n(7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\nThis matches the M⁺ peak. All the given options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the carbonyl region and corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, which typically appears between 1730-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde and phenol) unlikely. We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is in the very downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm), which is characteristic of a highly deshielded **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. It is a singlet as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This further supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** There are two signals in the aromatic region, totaling 4 protons (2H + 2H = 4H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** Two equivalent protons split into a doublet.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** Another two equivalent protons split into a doublet.\n*   **Interpretation of Aromatic Signals:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts. Each set of two equivalent protons is split by the neighboring set, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Options:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n    *   It contains a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   Its *para* substitution pattern would produce exactly the observed ¹H NMR aromatic signals: two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   The molecular weight matches the MS data.\n    *   This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data.\n\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in an *ortho* (1,2) arrangement.\n    *   While it has a carboxylic acid group and the correct molecular weight, its substitution pattern is incorrect.\n    *   An *ortho*-disubstituted ring would have four unique aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two doublets of 2H each.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The MS shows the correct mass and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak confirm the carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern is characteristic of a molecule containing a halogen.\n    *   The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1 (or 100:33).\n    *   The natural abundance of bromine isotopes is approximately 50% ⁷⁹Br and 50% ⁸¹Br, leading to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 1:1 (or 100:100).\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed ratio of 100:32 strongly indicates the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of the proposed options, all of which have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\nMolecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). This is consistent with all the options.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a conjugated carboxylic acid falls around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a **carboxylic acid functional group**. This eliminates option **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which has an aldehyde and a phenol) and **D) Phenyl chloroformate** (which has an acid chloride and no O-H group). We are left with options A and B.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is the classic signature of a **carboxylic acid proton**. This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons adjacent (ortho) to one substituent are equivalent, and the protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This structure fits the NMR data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) benzene ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and one chlorine atom.\n*   IR shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the M+ peak, has an intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very characteristic absorption for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. The extreme broadness is a key feature.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm are in the aromatic region, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular formula consistent with C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW=156 for ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR, we know it is a carboxylic acid.\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know it is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\nCombining these findings, the structure must be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a *para* (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid and would not give the IR or ¹H NMR signals observed.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** This structure is a *para*-substituted carboxylic acid containing chlorine. It perfectly matches all the spectral data: MW of 156, the 3:1 M+/M+2 ratio, the characteristic IR peaks for a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR pattern for a *para*-substituted ring plus a carboxylic acid proton.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11 ppm, and its IR spectrum would be different.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158, with a relative intensity of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%), is highly significant. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl isotope, ~75%, and the ³⁷Cl isotope, ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, which is often found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is diagnostic for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It appears as a singlet ('s') because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and its integration for one proton ('1H') confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, leading to this simplified pattern. The two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Evidence:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know it has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting it all together, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom attached in the *para* (or 4-) position. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this fits all the data:\n*   **Structure:** 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). This matches the MS data.\n*   **Functional Groups:** Contains a carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom on a benzene ring, matching the IR data.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Contains a carboxylic acid proton (matches 11.0 ppm signal) and a *para*-disubstituted ring (matches the two doublets for 2H each). The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and would appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\nAll evidence points to option C.\n\nLet's quickly rule out the other options:\n*   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Would have a different, more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR.\n*   B) Phenyl chloroformate: Lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H in the IR or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is an *ortho*-disubstituted ring, which would give a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The intensity of this M+2 peak is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly suggests the presence of an O-H group involved in extensive hydrogen bonding. Specifically, this wide range is the hallmark of a **carboxylic acid** (R-COOH).\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region (C=O). Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out options C (phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H) and D (an aldehyde, which would have a different O-H profile if phenolic, and lacks the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals in this region, which is typical for protons attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to two equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. The doublet splitting indicates they are adjacent to (coupled with) one neighboring proton.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to another set of two equivalent protons. They are also split into a doublet.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, for a total of 4 aromatic protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents create a plane of symmetry, making the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted ring. It would not produce a simple two-doublet pattern in the ¹H NMR. Instead, it would show a more complex pattern of four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly.\n    *   **MS:** Molecular weight is 156.5 g/mol and it contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR spectrum.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a carboxylic acid, explaining the 11.0 ppm signal. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, which would produce two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded (further downfield, 8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR data (not a carboxylic acid).\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR data (not a carboxylic acid, and would have a different NMR spectrum for the aldehyde and aromatic protons).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the compound is 156 amu.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% (compared to 100% for the M⁺ peak) is highly significant. The intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak to the M⁺+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This pattern is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula for the options. All proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight of (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. A C=O stretch around 1720-1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **B) Phenyl chloroformate** (which lacks an O-H group) and **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, a combination that doesn't produce this exact IR signature, especially the broadness down to 2700 cm⁻¹). We are now left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield ( > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet as it does not couple with any other protons, and it integrates to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   We see two distinct signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm and a doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons, for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   This simple \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The NMR data points to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted molecule. It would show exactly this NMR pattern.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted molecule. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the evidence:\n*   **MS** shows a molecular weight of 156 and one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all the spectral data perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of about 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%).\n    *   The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl isotope is ~75% abundant, ³⁷Cl isotope is ~25% abundant, giving a ~3:1 ratio).\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35). The formula for all options except A (which is an isomer) is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This molecular weight matches the M+ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton (1H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group. It would not show the broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted benzoic acid. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular formula, the four protons on the benzene ring would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   It has the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and contains chlorine, matching the MS data.\n        *   It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data (broad O-H and C=O stretch).\n        *   It has a carboxylic acid proton, matching the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n        *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring, which would produce the observed pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons next to the -Cl atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly fits all the provided data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. Instead, it would have an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (using the most abundant isotope for each element).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+2 peak is highly characteristic of the presence of a chlorine or bromine atom.\n    *   Chlorine has two common isotopes: ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance). The ratio of their abundances is approximately 3:1.\n    *   A molecule containing one chlorine atom will show two peaks in the mass spectrum: an M+ peak (containing ³⁵Cl) and an M+2 peak (containing ³⁷Cl). The expected intensity ratio is approximately 100:(24.2/75.8 * 100) ≈ 100:32.\n    *   The observed ratio of 100:32 is a perfect match for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options to confirm they match. All options (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a nominal mass of 156 (for ³⁵Cl).\n    `7*12 (C) + 5*1 (H) + 1*35 (Cl) + 2*16 (O) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156`\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to dimerization through hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates and rules out A (aldehyde/phenol) and B (phenyl chloroformate).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a singlet integrating to one proton, located in a very downfield region. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data and eliminates options A and B.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:**\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation of Aromatic Region:** The aromatic region of the spectrum shows a highly symmetrical pattern. The presence of only two signals, both of which are doublets and each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Candidates (C and D):**\n\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It has no plane of symmetry that simplifies the proton signals. It would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region for the four different aromatic protons, which would be a much more complex pattern than what is observed.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring.\n    *   It has the required carboxylic acid and chlorine atom.\n    *   Its molecular weight is 156.\n    *   It possesses the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets in the ¹H NMR spectrum, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -Cl group are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure. The mass spectrum indicates a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the ¹H NMR definitively shows a para-substitution pattern. Therefore, the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (for the most abundant isotopes).\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (m/z=156) to the M+2 peak (m/z=158) is 100% to 32%, which is approximately a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**. (The natural abundance of Chlorine-35 is ~75% and Chlorine-37 is ~25%).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know the molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these pieces, the structure must be a benzoic acid molecule with a chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring at the para (or 4-) position. This leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check the proposed structure against the options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This would show a more complex pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid and would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would have different IR and ¹H NMR signals.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight for the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol. It is a carboxylic acid with a para-substituted benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence rules out Phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which is an aldehyde and a phenol. Phenolic -OH peaks are typically broad but usually don't extend as low as 2700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ = 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitively a proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This further confirms the IR analysis and rules out options A and D. The signal is a singlet because carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **δ = 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and δ = 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H). This highly symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) has an *ortho* substitution pattern, which would result in four distinct aromatic proton signals with more complex splitting (not two simple doublets).\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) has a *para* substitution pattern. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data, giving two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR and ¹H NMR confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR aromatic region pattern confirms a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak, is called the M+2 peak. The relative intensity of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific 3:1 ratio is a tell-tale sign for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, as chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (approx. 75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (approx. 25% abundance).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position, coupled with the O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The conjugation with an aromatic ring slightly lowers the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with and often exchanges too rapidly to show coupling. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4 aromatic protons. This means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of **1,4-disubstitution (para-substitution)** on a benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two on the other, giving two signals. They appear as doublets because each proton is split by its single ortho neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesis and Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **From the data:** We are looking for a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a benzoic acid (has -COOH) with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 for the ³⁵Cl isotope. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Correct)\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a -COOH proton and a para-disubstituted ring, which would give two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. (Correct)\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. The ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two doublets. (Incorrect)\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the -COOH proton at ~11 ppm and would not show the very broad IR stretch from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the IR peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11 ppm. (Incorrect)\n\nThe only structure that perfectly matches all pieces of spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotope of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is another peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). The ratio of the intensities of the M⁺ to M⁺+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine (Cl) atom, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (11.0 ppm):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** The signal corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** Carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically exchange rapidly, so they do not show coupling to adjacent protons, appearing as a singlet.\n    *   This signal confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region:** Both signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution creates two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (at 8.02 ppm).\n    *   The two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Each set of protons is split into a doublet by its neighbors.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\nThe evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single structure:\n*   From MS: MW = 156, contains one Cl.\n*   From IR & ¹H NMR: Contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR: The -COOH and -Cl groups are in a *para* arrangement on a benzene ring.\n\nThis structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group required by the IR and the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Correct. The molecular weight (C₇H₅ClO₂ gives MW=156 for ³⁵Cl), functional groups (carboxylic acid), and substitution pattern (*para*) all perfectly match the provided data.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it has the correct formula and functional groups, its *ortho* substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound based on its most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the molecular ion peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n        *   All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   The M+2 peak would be from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. This eliminates none of the options, but confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This strongly supports options A and D, and rules out options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride/ester which lacks the O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol, which would have a different C=O stretch and a phenolic O-H stretch, not the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The singlet multiplicity is also expected. This further supports options A and D.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is crucial. Having only two signals, both of which are doublets and integrate to 2 protons each, indicates a highly symmetric, para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring's axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n        *   **Structure A (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern: two doublets, each representing 2 protons.\n        *   **Structure D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments relative to the two different substituents. This would result in a more complex pattern, likely with four separate signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H. It would not produce two doublets of 2H each.\n\n*   **Final Synthesis:**\n    *   The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine.\n    *   The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The aromatic region of the NMR (two doublets of 2H each) confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) fits all of these spectral data points.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires combining information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimerization.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and D (3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Peak at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**O**H). The integration confirms it is a single proton (1H). It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Peaks in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals.\n        *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity means they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two other equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity also indicates they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   This pattern—two doublets, each integrating to two protons—is a classic signature for a *para*- (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (no carboxylic acid).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This lack of symmetry means there would be four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's calculate the MW: (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches. It contains Cl, also a match.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches.\n        *   **NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm). It has a *para*-disubstituted ring, which would produce the observed symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (it's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be different).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic version of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. The ratio of the peak heights (M⁺ to M⁺+2) is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** This 3:1 ratio for an M⁺ and M⁺+2 peak is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule (Chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   We can confirm the molecular weight of the options. All proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight corresponding to the MS data.\n    *   C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 g/mol.\n*   The MS data confirms the molecular formula is likely C₇H₅ClO₂ but doesn't differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which form dimers.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks is a definitive signature for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to rule out options that do not contain a carboxylic acid, such as **(A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and **(D) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride / ester).\n\n### **3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: **(B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **(C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The NMR spectrum will distinguish between them.\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   We have two signals in the aromatic region: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   The total integration is 4 protons, which is correct for a chlorobenzoic acid (C₆H₄ + COOH + Cl).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. This symmetry means the two protons next to one substituent are chemically identical, and the two protons next to the other substituent are also chemically identical.\n    *   **In 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, the COOH is at C1 and the Cl is at C4. The protons at C2 and C6 are equivalent, and the protons at C3 and C5 are equivalent. This creates the observed \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern.\n    *   **In 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, the substituents are adjacent (at C1 and C2). This removes the molecule's symmetry. All four aromatic protons would be in different chemical environments, leading to four separate and more complex signals, not the simple pattern observed.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   The IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, indicates a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) aromatic ring structure.\n\nCombining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the nominal molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to the 3:1 ratio characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to its natural isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with abundances of ~75.8% and ~24.2% respectively).\n    *   So, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group's stretch. This specific frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the far downfield region, which is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and it's a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The splitting pattern provides crucial information about the substitution on the benzene ring. Having two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent to each other, resulting in two distinct signals.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope), contains one chlorine atom, possesses a carboxylic acid group, and has a *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring. All spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are perfectly consistent with this structure. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be the more downfield signal (8.02 ppm), and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be the slightly more upfield signal (7.72 ppm).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight and functional group, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region, with four unique proton signals, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR would show an aldehyde proton signal (around 9-10 ppm) instead of the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. The IR spectrum would also be different.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acid chloride derivative (a chloroformate). It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the ¹H NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. Its C=O IR stretch would also be at a higher frequency (>1775 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion:** All evidence points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires interpreting several types of spectroscopic data. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   So, we are looking for a compound containing one chlorine atom with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl). Let's check the options, which all have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are isomers and match the mass spectrometry data. We need to use the other spectra to differentiate them.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an acyl chloride and would lack the broad O-H) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol; while it has an O-H, it wouldn't be as broad as a carboxylic acid, and the carbonyl would be for an aldehyde). We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7-8.5 ppm):** We have two signals in this region, which indicates the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **The Aromatic Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry causes the two protons ortho to one substituent to be chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent to also be equivalent. This results in two sets of protons. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n*   We have narrowed our choices down to 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho-substituted):** Would have 4 distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex pattern of multiplets, not two simple doublets.\n*   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-substituted):** This structure has the required 1,4-disubstitution pattern that gives rise to two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, combining all the evidence, the unknown compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (Natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula that fits this is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Calculation: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5, avg) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   With ³⁵Cl: 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   With ³⁷Cl: 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    This confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a classic, very distinctive peak for the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the characteristic range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the O-H peak, this corresponds to the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal far downfield, between 10-13 ppm, is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para structure makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains a benzene ring with two different substituents arranged in a para (1,4) configuration. One of those substituents is the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\n*   **From MS:** We know the molecule is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **From IR and NMR:** We know it contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **From NMR:** We know the substituents are on a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThe pieces are: a benzene ring, a -COOH group, and a -Cl atom. Arranging them in a para configuration gives the structure **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It is an acyl chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR peak and the ¹H NMR signal at 11 ppm.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Perfect match.** It has the correct formula (C₇H₅ClO₂), the carboxylic acid functional group (explains IR and the 11 ppm NMR signal), and the para-substitution pattern (explains the two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is ortho-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets of 2H each.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton signal (~9-10 ppm) instead of a carboxylic acid proton, and it has a phenolic -OH, not a carboxylic acid -OH.\n\nThe combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data (Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR) to deduce the structure of an unknown compound from a given list of options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. (Naturally occurring chlorine is a mixture of two isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance)).\n\nLet's verify the molecular formula and weight for the candidates. All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\n\nThe molecular weight calculation (using the most common isotopes, C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35) is:\n(7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = **156 g/mol**.\n\nThis matches the M+ peak. The presence of the ³⁷Cl isotope would give a molecular weight of 158, matching the M+2 peak. Therefore, the mass spectrometry data is consistent with all four options, confirming the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nThe combination of these two peaks is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** An acid chloride. Would lack the broad O-H stretch. Eliminated.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** A carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** A carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** A phenol (-OH) and an aldehyde (-CHO). A phenolic O-H is typically less broad (e.g., 3500-3200 cm⁻¹), and an aldehyde lacks the specific broadness down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This option is unlikely. Eliminated.\n\nBased on the IR data, the compound is either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides information about the different types of protons and their neighboring environment.\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   The key information here is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   This simple, symmetrical pattern arises from a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on this pattern:\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. It has no plane of symmetry, meaning all four aromatic protons are chemically unique. This would lead to a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It possesses the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly matches the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n1.  **MS** confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n2.  **IR** identifies the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring to be para (1,4-).\n\nThe only structure that fits all the evidence is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is M+2. The relative intensity is 32% (100:32 ratio is approximately 3:1). This distinct M/M+2 pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes exist in an approximate 3:1 natural abundance).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂):\n        *   (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This rules out options A (phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and C (an aldehyde, which would have a C=O peak but no carboxylic O-H, and its NMR would be different). We are left with options B and D.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in this region (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n        *   The signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   We have two signals: one doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H. This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   **Option B (2-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *ortho*-substituted. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to four separate, more complex signals (not two simple doublets).\n        *   **Option D (4-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *para*-substituted. This structure has a plane of symmetry. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the carboxylic acid group are equivalent and would appear as one signal. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and would appear as a second signal. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum of two doublets, each integrating to two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -Cl group are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data—the molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern from MS, the carboxylic acid signatures from IR, and the characteristic para-substitution pattern in the ¹H NMR—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   This 3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The mass would be (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. All four options provided have this molecular formula and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n*   A strong, sharp absorption peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   Combining these two observations, the IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   Let's evaluate the options based on the IR data:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Does not contain an O-H group. This is inconsistent.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. This is consistent.\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Contains a phenol -OH and an aldehyde C=O. A phenolic -OH is typically broad, but the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ range is the classic \"hairy beard\" appearance of a carboxylic acid O-H. This option is less likely.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. This is consistent.\n*   Based on the IR data, the most likely candidates are B and D.\n\n**3. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a signal in the very downfield region of the spectrum. It is a singlet and integrates to one proton. This is the characteristic chemical shift and multiplicity for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We see two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern indicates a highly symmetrical aromatic ring. Specifically, this is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent, as are the two protons on the other side. They couple with their neighbors to form two distinct doublets.\n*   Let's evaluate the remaining candidates (B and D) based on the NMR data:\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). It has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group at opposite ends of the benzene ring. This symmetry would produce exactly the observed pattern: two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). This substitution pattern removes the symmetry seen in the para isomer. The four protons on the aromatic ring would all be in chemically distinct environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four separate signals, likely multiplets), not two simple doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nAll three pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a para-substituted benzene ring structure. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%.\n    *   The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl, ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl, ~24.2%).\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of the proposed structures using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl). The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n        *   The M+2 peak would come from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 37 + (2 × 16) = 158.\n    *   All four options have the correct molecular weight and would exhibit this isotopic pattern. So, the MS data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This specific frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the unknown compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid. This eliminates options C (which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and D (which is a chloroformate and has no O-H group). We are left with options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (it does not couple with nearby protons), which is typical. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We have a total of four aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side. This creates an AA'BB' spin system that often appears as two distinct doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, all four aromatic protons would be chemically distinct and in different environments. We would expect to see a more complex splitting pattern with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets), not two simple doublets of 2H each. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce the observed NMR spectrum: two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two equivalent protons. The carboxylic acid proton would appear around 11 ppm. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of all the spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158, with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or ~3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options using the ³⁵Cl isotope. The molecular formula for all options is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding in the carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. A carbonyl in a conjugated carboxylic acid appears in the 1725-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n    *   These two peaks together are a strong indication that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Evaluating the options:\n        *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. Consistent.\n        *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. Consistent.\n        *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Has an aldehyde (C=O) and a phenol (O-H). The O-H stretch of a phenol is broad, but typically not as broad as a carboxylic acid (usually 3500-3200 cm⁻¹). The IR is less consistent with this option.\n        *   D) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acid chloride/ester. It lacks an O-H group, so it would not have the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. The carbonyl peak for an acid chloride is also at a higher frequency (around 1800 cm⁻¹). This option is inconsistent with the IR data.\n    *   The IR data strongly suggests the compound is either 4-chlorobenzoic acid or 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing at such a high chemical shift (δ > 10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet as it doesn't couple with other protons and integrates to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** We have two signals in the aromatic region:\n        *   8.02 ppm (d, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (d, 2H)\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, leading to two distinct chemical environments for the aromatic protons.\n        *   The protons labeled Ha are ortho (adjacent) to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, making them more deshielded and shifting them further downfield (8.02 ppm). They are split into a doublet by the adjacent Hb protons.\n        *   The protons labeled Hb are ortho to the chlorine atom, which is less electron-withdrawing than the carboxylic acid group. They are therefore more shielded (further upfield at 7.72 ppm) compared to Ha. They are split into a doublet by the adjacent Ha protons.\n    *   Let's check the remaining options against this NMR pattern:\n        *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) molecule. It would produce exactly the observed pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. This is a perfect match.\n        *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) molecule. It would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets). This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   All three pieces of spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak). The intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak is 32/100, which is approximately 1/3.\n*   This characteristic M+ and M+2 peak pattern with a ~3:1 ratio is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n*   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak is observed from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n*   A strong, sharp absorption peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, specifically within the typical range for a carboxylic acid (1725-1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration (1H) confirms one such proton. It is a singlet because it does not typically couple with other protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate the presence of protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents two chemically equivalent protons on the benzene ring. The fact that it is a doublet means it is split by a single neighboring proton.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents another pair of two chemically equivalent protons. It is also a doublet, indicating it is split by a single neighboring proton.\n*   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two distinct sets of equivalent protons, and each set is adjacent to the other, causing them to split each other into doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid containing a chlorine atom attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would show an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm) and a complex pattern for three aromatic protons, not the para-substitution pattern observed. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom, which matches the MS and IR. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be equivalent in pairs and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** Its formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches perfectly. The presence of one chlorine atom explains the M+2 peak.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the broad O-H and sharp C=O peaks.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which gives the exact pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. The carboxylic acid proton matches the signal at 11.0 ppm. This structure is a perfect fit for all the provided data.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\n*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak), which is about one-third (32%) the intensity of the M+ peak.\n    *   This characteristic M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75.8% for ³⁵Cl and ~24.2% for ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, Phenyl chloroformate) have the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   The molecular weight is calculated as: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   For the ³⁷Cl isotope, the weight would be 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹), often slightly higher due to conjugation or electron-withdrawing substituents.\n    *   Based on these two key peaks, the compound must be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This allows us to eliminate option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is a phenol and an aldehyde. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the O-H stretch of a phenol is typically less broad (~3600-3200 cm⁻¹), and the very broad peak down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is the classic sign of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   We can also eliminate option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an acid chloride/ester hybrid. It has a C=O bond but no O-H group, so it would not show the broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both remaining options A and B.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key to determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. We see two distinct signals:\n        *   8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n    *   This pattern, two doublets each integrating to two protons, indicates a highly symmetric, 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's examine the remaining structures:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It has no such plane of symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would give rise to a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals. This does not match the data.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It possesses the required symmetry. The two protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the -COOH group) are equivalent. The two protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the -Cl group) are equivalent. This structure would produce exactly two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a formula of C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The IR data identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data establishes a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Combining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes. So, the molecular mass is 156 u.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The two major isotopes of chlorine are ³⁵Cl (~75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2% abundance). The molecule containing ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156 u, and the one containing ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158 u. The ratio of their abundances (~76:24) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 u and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The wide range is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs in carboxylic acid dimers.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, a carbonyl in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid appears around 1720-1680 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both the very broad O-H and the C=O stretch strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange with trace amounts of water.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. In such a symmetrical ring, the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side. This creates two sets of equivalent protons, which split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n\n1.  **MS** tells us the compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (Molecular Mass = 7\\*12 + 5\\*1 + 35 + 2\\*16 = 156).\n2.  **IR** tells us the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and tells us the benzene ring is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this synthesis:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** Chlorine and carboxylic acid are at the 1 and 4 (para) positions on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Fits MS:** Yes, M=156 with one Cl.\n    *   **Fits IR:** Yes, it is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Fits NMR:** Yes, it has the acidic proton (~11 ppm) and the para-substitution pattern (two doublets, each 2H). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid, and the 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring would give a more complex NMR signal (three distinct aromatic protons), not two doublets.\n\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. The lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a complex multiplet, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. It also lacks the acidic proton, so it would not have the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (using the most abundant isotopes).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 is the M+2 peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75.8% for ³⁵Cl and 24.2% for ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the proposed structures. The molecular formula for all options (A, B, C, D) is C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass is (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. All options are consistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This rules out Phenyl chloroformate (C), which lacks an O-H group, and makes 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) less likely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)** is in the typical chemical shift range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to deshielding, and it appears as a singlet because acidic protons often do not couple with neighboring protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid and rules out options C and D. We are now left with A (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**. This pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted. This structure would exhibit this exact NMR pattern.\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. This would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Combining all the evidence, the compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic functional groups of a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern of a para-substituted aromatic ring attached to a carboxylic acid (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (natural abundance: ~75% ³⁵Cl, ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n*   Formula for A, B, and D (C₇H₅ClO₂): (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   Formula for C (C₇H₅ClO₂): Same as above, 156 g/mol.\nAll options are consistent with the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This immediately makes options C (Phenyl chloroformate, an ester/acid halide) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol) highly unlikely. The evidence strongly points toward a chlorobenzoic acid (A or B).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is expected. The integration '1H' confirms it represents one proton. This further supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both of which are doublets ('d'). The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H on the aromatic ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   Based on all the data, the compound is a carboxylic acid containing one chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring.\n*   The NMR data specifically indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   Let's compare the remaining options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, which would produce two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has an *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, all evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with its most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is the M+2 peak. The intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak is 32/100, which is approximately 1:3.\n    *   This characteristic M+ to M+2 ratio of 3:1 is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular formula with a mass of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. The python code confirmed that all options have a molecular weight of 156.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This eliminates options C (Phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm** is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key. There are two signals, one at **8.02 ppm** and another at **7.72 ppm**.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet (d), meaning the protons giving rise to that signal are adjacent to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to two protons (2H), meaning there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons next to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons next to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring substituted with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The NMR data tells us the substitution pattern is para (1,4).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nLet's check the options again:\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted carboxylic acid. It fits all the data perfectly.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. It would give a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (four separate signals), not two doublets.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is not a carboxylic acid. It would not show the IR or NMR signals for the -COOH group.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The spectral data would be different.\n\nThe only structure consistent with all the provided evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. Its relative abundance is 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M:M+2 ratio of approximately 100:32 (or roughly 3:1) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine (Cl) atom** in the molecule. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), which leads to this pattern.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ isotopologue) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and thus have a molecular weight of 156. Therefore, the MS data is consistent with all four options.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, C=O stretches for aromatic carboxylic acids appear around 1710-1680 cm⁻¹. This peak, in combination with the broad O-H stretch, provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (has an aldehyde and a phenol, but not a carboxylic acid).\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (The C=O stretch for a chloroformate is at a much higher frequency, ~1775 cm⁻¹, and it lacks an O-H group).\n*   We are now left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid), as both are carboxylic acids.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton**. The signal is a singlet (s) because this proton is not adjacent to any other protons to couple with. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The key to distinguishing between options A and D lies in the pattern of the aromatic protons (protons attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   We see a doublet at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.72 ppm (2H)**.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also chemically equivalent. This gives only two signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. It has no plane of symmetry, meaning all four aromatic protons are chemically different. This would result in a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals (likely multiplets), not a simple pair of doublets.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It has a plane of symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent protons, which perfectly explains the observed pattern of two doublets for 2H each. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and correspond to the 8.02 ppm signal, while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom correspond to the 7.72 ppm signal.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll pieces of spectral data point unambiguously to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown white solid.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes. We'll assume this corresponds to the molecule containing the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative abundance of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) gives a ratio of approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options. All proposed structures (2-chlorobenzoic acid, phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very strong indicator of an O-H bond stretch within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns perfectly with the carbonyl group in a conjugated carboxylic acid (Ar-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both of these peaks strongly suggests the molecule is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate option (B) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride) and (C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde with a phenol group). We are left with options (A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and (D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration (1H) confirms it is one proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This further confirms our conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The splitting pattern is key.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para*-substituted ring results in only two unique types of aromatic protons.\n        *   The two protons next to one substituent are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two protons next to the other substituent are also chemically equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons is split into a doublet by its single adjacent proton neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The spectrum indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nLet's compare the remaining options with the NMR data:\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It has no symmetry plane passing through the bonds, so all four aromatic protons would be chemically different, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted ring. This structure has the required symmetry to produce two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would cause the adjacent ortho protons to appear more downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\nAll pieces of evidence (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**:\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The mass difference of 2 amu (158 - 156) and the intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak (32:100 or approximately 1:3) is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**:\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**:\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)**: This very downfield chemical shift is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet as it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**: These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent, as are the two protons on the other side, leading to this simplified pattern. The downfield shifts indicate the ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups (like -COOH and -Cl).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula and structure for each option against the spectral data. The data points towards a molecule with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for ³⁵Cl).\n\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate**: MW ≈ 172.5 g/mol. This does not match the mass spec data.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n        *   **MW**: C₇H₅ClO₂ -> (7×12)+(5×1)+35+(2×16) = 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: It is a carboxylic acid. Matches IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern**: It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. This perfectly matches the ¹H NMR aromatic signals (two doublets, each for 2H). The electron-withdrawing COOH group would cause the adjacent ortho protons to shift downfield (likely the 8.02 ppm signal), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be slightly less deshielded (the 7.72 ppm signal). This is a perfect match.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n        *   **MW**: 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: Carboxylic acid. Matches IR.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern**: *Ortho*-substituted. This would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not two simple doublets. Does not match NMR.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**:\n        *   **MW**: 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: Contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. This is inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal which are definitive for a carboxylic acid. Also, it only has 3 aromatic protons, which contradicts the integration of the NMR signals (2H + 2H = 4H).\n\n*   **Conclusion**:\n    All spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak), which is 32% as intense as the M+ peak. This ~3:1 ratio for M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (35Cl has ~75% abundance, and 37Cl has ~25% abundance).\n*   *Conclusion*: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak stretching from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimer form.\n*   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   *Conclusion*: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical region for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and the singlet (s) multiplicity is expected as this proton does not have any adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. This pattern arises because of the symmetry in the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Structure:**\n*   From MS, we know we have one Chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know we have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know these two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n*   Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**5. Verification and Elimination of Other Options:**\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   Molecular Weight (with 35Cl): (7*12)+(5*1)+(35*1)+(2*16) = 156. **Matches MS.**\n    *   Functional Group: Carboxylic acid. **Matches IR.**\n    *   Substitution Pattern: Para-substituted ring with an acidic proton. **Matches NMR.**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. It would show four unique, complex signals in the aromatic region of the NMR, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride/ester. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a substituted aldehyde. It lacks the characteristic signals of a carboxylic acid (the extremely broad IR peak and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm). The NMR aromatic region would also be more complex.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is unequivocally 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. This is referred to as the M+2 peak.\n    *   The relative intensity of the M+2 peak (32%) compared to the M+ peak (100%) is approximately a 1:3 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption band from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, this value is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two IR features are strong evidence for the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly diagnostic for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not typically couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, each coupling with its neighbor to produce a doublet.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **Conclusion from data:** The molecule is a chlorobenzoic acid with a para substitution pattern. This means a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group are attached to a benzene ring at positions 1 and 4.\n*   **Checking the Molecular Formula:** A chlorobenzoic acid has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Its molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches the mass spectrum perfectly.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would have a more complex NMR spectrum. It's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid (lacks the ~11 ppm NMR signal and characteristic broad IR). Incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a para (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the spectral data (MS, IR, and the characteristic NMR pattern). **Correct.**\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the 11 ppm NMR signal. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2) ring. The four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to a much more complex NMR splitting pattern than two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n\nThe only structure that fits all the evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of intensities, M+ : M+2 ≈ 100:32 ≈ 3:1, is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two main isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which results in this characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks in molecules containing one Cl atom.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's calculate the molecular formula. The formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope: 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 amu. So, the molecular formula is correct.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (conjugated system).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This evidence makes options C (aldehyde) and D (acid chloride) unlikely.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton. It's a singlet because it doesn't couple with other protons, and the integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The two signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Symmetry and Splitting:** There are only two signals for the four aromatic protons. Both signals are doublets (`d`) and each integrates to two protons (`2H`). This simple `d, 2H` + `d, 2H` pattern is indicative of a highly symmetrical *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and has a *para*-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\nLet's evaluate the options based on the combined data:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzoic acid. The four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to four distinct signals in the NMR, not two doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid. This structure fits all the data:\n    *   It's a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   Its molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ matches the MS data.\n    *   The *para* substitution pattern creates the symmetry needed for the `d, 2H` + `d, 2H` NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR and the very broad O-H stretch in the IR. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks the hydroxyl group entirely, so it wouldn't have the O-H signals in the IR or ¹H NMR. This is incorrect.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. The relative intensity ratio is M+ : M+2 ≈ 100 : 32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl. Thus, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156. All the proposed options (chlorobenzoic acids, etc.) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The mass spectrometry data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, exceptionally broad absorption band for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option **C) Phenyl chloroformate**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H stretch. It also makes option **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** unlikely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad (e.g., 3500-3200 cm⁻¹) than a carboxylic acid O-H. The remaining plausible options are **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) (as it doesn't couple with other protons) confirms the -COOH group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** The remaining signals, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Symmetry and Pattern:** We see a total of four aromatic protons (2H + 2H = 4H). These protons are split into two distinct groups of two protons each. Both signals are doublets (d). This simple A₂B₂ pattern (often appearing as two doublets) is a classic indicator of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is *para*.\n    *   This result directly supports **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, which has a para-substitution pattern.\n    *   This result rules out **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, which has an *ortho*-substitution pattern. An ortho-substituted ring would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n    *   This also rules out **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**, which is trisubstituted and would only have three aromatic protons with a different, more complex splitting pattern.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n*   MS indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure among the choices that fits all of these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This distinctive isotopic pattern is a classic indicator for the presence of a single **chlorine (Cl)** atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically absorb in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range, so 1720 cm⁻¹ is a very reasonable value.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet (s) because this proton rapidly exchanges and does not typically couple with other protons. The integration (1H) confirms it represents a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.72 ppm and 8.02 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate protons on a benzene ring.\n*   **Splitting Pattern (d, 2H and d, 2H):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are doublets (d), and each integrates to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. This results in just two signals for the four aromatic protons, appearing as two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### **Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\nCombining all the clues:\n*   We have a **chlorine atom**.\n*   We have a **carboxylic acid group**.\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **para (1,4) arrangement**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this structure matches all the data and why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has the correct molecular weight (156) but lacks a carboxylic acid. It would not show the broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum for an ortho-substituted ring would be much more complex, showing four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Has the correct molecular weight but is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the characteristic carboxylic acid signals in both IR and NMR spectra. The aromatic protons would also show a different, more complex pattern.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 (with ³⁵Cl), matching the MS.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution:** It is para-substituted, perfectly explaining the ¹H NMR pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields its neighboring protons more strongly, accounting for the more downfield doublet at 8.02 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. Its relative intensity is 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** This M⁺ and M+2 pattern, with an approximate intensity ratio of 3:1 (100:32), is a definitive indicator for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options.\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that results from the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid**. The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate options A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid halide) and B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde with a phenol). We are left with options C and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both appearing as doublets and each representing two protons. This splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   We have narrowed the possibilities down to 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho-substituted) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-substituted).\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum clearly shows the symmetrical pattern of a **para-substituted** ring. A 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho) would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   Therefore, the structure must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher (M+2).\n    *   The intensity of the M+2 peak is 32% of the M⁺ peak (100%).\n    *   The M⁺ to M+2 ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes have natural abundances of approximately 75.8% and 24.2%, respectively, giving a ratio of ~3:1).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options.\n        *   A) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   B) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   C) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   D) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n    *   All options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. The broadness is a key feature.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch. The position is consistent with a conjugated carboxylic acid (an aromatic carboxylic acid).\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   This eliminates option A (which is a phenol and an aldehyde) and option C (which is a chloroformate, lacks an O-H group, and its C=O stretch would be at a much higher frequency, ~1780-1815 cm⁻¹).\n    *   We are now left with options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons, which is typical for acidic protons), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet corresponding to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet corresponding to two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents create a plane of symmetry, so there are only two types of aromatic protons. Each type has one neighbor, hence they appear as doublets.\n    *   Let's look at the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern of two doublets for its four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing COOH group would be more deshielded (further downfield, 8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. There is no plane of symmetry through the bonds. It would have four distinct aromatic protons, each with a different chemical shift, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four signals, likely a combination of doublets, triplets, or doublet of doublets). This does not match the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined analysis of MS, IR, and especially the ¹H NMR data, the only structure that fits all the evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern, with a ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1), is a distinctive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom.

Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly indicates the presence of an O-H bond involved in hydrogen bonding. The extreme broadness is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **D) Phenyl chloroformate**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is a singlet (s) integrating to one proton (1H). Its chemical shift is far downfield, which is highly characteristic of an acidic proton from a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   They are both doublets (d), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   They each integrate to two protons (2H), for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring. This substitution pattern creates a high degree of symmetry, where the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with three distinct aromatic signals, not two doublets. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl), which matches the MS data.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution:** It has a para- (1,4-) substitution pattern, which perfectly explains the ¹H NMR signals (two doublets of 2H each). The carboxylic acid proton explains the singlet at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho- (1,2-) disubstituted ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons and a much more complex ¹H NMR splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid, and is inconsistent with the IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most common isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula of the options. All proposed structures (A, B, C, D) are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Nominal Mass Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This confirms that all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is part of a conjugated system, such as a carboxylic acid attached to a benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid derivative without an O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenol O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the O-H peak is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid). We are left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** We see two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm): 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (like -COOH and -Cl), there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are identical, and they couple with their neighbors, creating a doublet. The same applies to the other pair of protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The aromatic substitution pattern is *para*.\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It would show a more complex pattern for its 4 distinct aromatic protons.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted. This substitution pattern perfectly matches the observed \"two doublets of 2H each\" signal. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the -Cl atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the compound.\n*   MS shows a molecule with formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   IR identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and establishes a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only option that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This pattern is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The molecular weight using the ³⁷Cl isotope is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158. All four options have this formula, so the MS data is consistent with any of them.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence allows us to eliminate option B (an aldehyde and a phenol) and option C (a chloroformate, which is an acid chloride derivative and would lack the broad O-H peak). We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region, at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm.\n        *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), which is consistent with a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n        *   The splitting pattern is crucial. We see two doublets. This symmetric pattern is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Option A, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,4-disubstituted ring and would produce this exact two-doublet pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at 7.72 ppm.\n        *   Option D, **2-chlorobenzoic acid**, is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) ring. This structure lacks the symmetry of the para isomer. It would have four chemically distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, the para substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from multiple spectroscopic techniques.

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak, has a relative abundance of about 32% (100% for 156, 32% for 158). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive signature for the presence of a single **chlorine atom** in the molecule. (Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of ~75% and ~25%, respectively).\n\nSo, we are looking for a chlorine-containing compound with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl). My calculation confirmed all four options have the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and molecular weight to match the mass spectrometry data. Therefore, we must rely on the other spectra to distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nThis IR evidence strongly suggests the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (an aldehyde/phenol) and C (a chloroformate), which would not show the broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (highly deshielded) is typical for an acidic proton. A chemical shift around 10-13 ppm is classic for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons to couple with), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We have two signals, each integrating to two protons (2H). Each signal is a doublet ('d'), meaning each set of protons is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. In such a ring, there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.\n\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly the symmetrical pattern observed: two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2- (ortho) substituted benzene ring. This structure is not symmetrical and would have four unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex splitting pattern (likely four distinct multiplets), not two clean doublets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   **MS** tells us the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **IR** identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a 1,4-disubstituted (para) aromatic ring structure.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures, assuming one chlorine atom. The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁵Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 35.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 156.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 156.\n    *   Molecular Weight (using ³⁷Cl) = (7 * 12.01) + (5 * 1.01) + (1 * 37.45) + (2 * 16.00) ≈ 158.5 g/mol. The integer mass is 158.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is right in the range for a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This rules out option A (aldehyde/phenol) and option D (chloroformate), as they would not have the characteristic broad O-H peak of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (highly deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (due to rapid exchange and no adjacent protons) confirms this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para*- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   This pattern eliminates 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B), which is *ortho*-disubstituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons.\n        *   This pattern perfectly matches 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C). The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid proton and indicates a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) is consistent with all three pieces of spectral data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with about one-third the intensity (32%) is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing a single chlorine atom. The Python script confirmed that the molecular weight for 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂) is indeed 156 amu, and for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂, it is 158 amu.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The combination of a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid) and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (a C=O stretch) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H is the signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), each integrating to 2H, indicate a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern results in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPutting all the evidence together, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom attached. The NMR spectrum specifically points to a *para* substitution pattern. Therefore, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The relative abundance of this peak is about 32% that of the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (Natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (with ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for the proposed structures to see if they match. The general formula is CₓHᵧClO₂.\nFor C₇H₅ClO₂, the mass would be:\n(7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\nThis matches the M⁺ peak. All the given options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This signal is in the carbonyl region and corresponds to the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, which typically appears between 1730-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde and phenol) unlikely. We are left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is in the very downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm), which is characteristic of a highly deshielded **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. It is a singlet as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This further supports the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** There are two signals in the aromatic region, totaling 4 protons (2H + 2H = 4H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** Two equivalent protons split into a doublet.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** Another two equivalent protons split into a doublet.\n*   **Interpretation of Aromatic Signals:** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the two sets of protons to have different chemical shifts. Each set of two equivalent protons is split by the neighboring set, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Options:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n    *   It contains a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   Its *para* substitution pattern would produce exactly the observed ¹H NMR aromatic signals: two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n    *   The molecular weight matches the MS data.\n    *   This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data.\n\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in an *ortho* (1,2) arrangement.\n    *   While it has a carboxylic acid group and the correct molecular weight, its substitution pattern is incorrect.\n    *   An *ortho*-disubstituted ring would have four unique aromatic protons, each integrating to 1H, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four different multiplets), not two doublets of 2H each.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The MS shows the correct mass and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak confirm the carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern is characteristic of a molecule containing a halogen.\n    *   The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl, leading to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1 (or 100:33).\n    *   The natural abundance of bromine isotopes is approximately 50% ⁷⁹Br and 50% ⁸¹Br, leading to an M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 1:1 (or 100:100).\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed ratio of 100:32 strongly indicates the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule.\n\nLet's check the molecular weight of the proposed options, all of which have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\nMolecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). This is consistent with all the options.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a conjugated carboxylic acid falls around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a **carboxylic acid functional group**. This eliminates option **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which has an aldehyde and a phenol) and **D) Phenyl chloroformate** (which has an acid chloride and no O-H group). We are left with options A and B.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is the classic signature of a **carboxylic acid proton**. This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The protons adjacent (ortho) to one substituent are equivalent, and the protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. They split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. This structure fits the NMR data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) benzene ring. This would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining all the spectral data:\n*   MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and one chlorine atom.\n*   IR shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   ¹H NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1.

The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very characteristic absorption for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. The extreme broadness is a key feature.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm are in the aromatic region, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is also a doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular formula consistent with C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW=156 for ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR, we know it is a carboxylic acid.\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know it is a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\nCombining these findings, the structure must be a benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a *para* (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid and would not give the IR or ¹H NMR signals observed.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** This structure is a *para*-substituted carboxylic acid containing chlorine. It perfectly matches all the spectral data: MW of 156, the 3:1 M+/M+2 ratio, the characteristic IR peaks for a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR pattern for a *para*-substituted ring plus a carboxylic acid proton.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid.

The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl isotope, ~75%, and the ³⁷Cl isotope, ~25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is diagnostic for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It appears as a singlet ('s') because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and its integration for one proton ('1H') confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, leading to this simplified pattern. The two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesizing the Evidence:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know it has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting it all together, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom attached in the *para* (or 4-) position.

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The intensity of this M+2 peak is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that strongly suggests the presence of an O-H group involved in extensive hydrogen bonding. Specifically, this wide range is the hallmark of a **carboxylic acid** (R-COOH).\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region (C=O). Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out options C (phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H) and D (an aldehyde, which would have a different O-H profile if phenolic, and lacks the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). The integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals in this region, which is typical for protons attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to two equivalent protons on the aromatic ring. The doublet splitting indicates they are adjacent to (coupled with) one neighboring proton.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to another set of two equivalent protons. They are also split into a doublet.\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, for a total of 4 aromatic protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents create a plane of symmetry, making the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted ring. It would not produce a simple two-doublet pattern in the ¹H NMR. Instead, it would show a more complex pattern of four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule fits all the data perfectly.\n    *   **MS:** Molecular weight is 156.5 g/mol and it contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR spectrum.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a carboxylic acid, explaining the 11.0 ppm signal. It is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, which would produce two doublets, each for 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded (further downfield, 8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR data (not a carboxylic acid).\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR data (not a carboxylic acid, and would have a different NMR spectrum for the aldehyde and aromatic protons).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the compound is 156 amu.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% (compared to 100% for the M⁺ peak) is highly significant. The intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak to the M⁺+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This pattern is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula for the options. All proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight of (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. A C=O stretch around 1720-1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **B) Phenyl chloroformate** (which lacks an O-H group) and **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, a combination that doesn't produce this exact IR signature, especially the broadness down to 2700 cm⁻¹). We are now left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield ( > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet as it does not couple with any other protons, and it integrates to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   We see two distinct signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm and a doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons, for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   This simple \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The NMR data points to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted molecule. It would show exactly this NMR pattern.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted molecule. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the evidence:\n*   **MS** shows a molecular weight of 156 and one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all the spectral data perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of about 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%).\n    *   The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl isotope is ~75% abundant, ³⁷Cl isotope is ~25% abundant, giving a ~3:1 ratio).\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35). The formula for all options except A (which is an isomer) is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   This molecular weight matches the M+ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton (1H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks a carboxylic acid group. It would not show the broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted benzoic acid. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular formula, the four protons on the benzene ring would be in unique chemical environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   It has the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and contains chlorine, matching the MS data.\n        *   It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data (broad O-H and C=O stretch).\n        *   It has a carboxylic acid proton, matching the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n        *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring, which would produce the observed pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. The two protons next to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the two protons next to the -Cl atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly fits all the provided data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. Instead, it would have an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (using the most abundant isotope for each element).\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+2 peak is highly characteristic of the presence of a chlorine or bromine atom.\n    *   Chlorine has two common isotopes: ³⁵Cl (75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (24.2% abundance). The ratio of their abundances is approximately 3:1.\n    *   A molecule containing one chlorine atom will show two peaks in the mass spectrum: an M+ peak (containing ³⁵Cl) and an M+2 peak (containing ³⁷Cl). The expected intensity ratio is approximately 100:(24.2/75.8 * 100) ≈ 100:32.\n    *   The observed ratio of 100:32 is a perfect match for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options to confirm they match. All options (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a nominal mass of 156 (for ³⁵Cl).\n    `7*12 (C) + 5*1 (H) + 1*35 (Cl) + 2*16 (O) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156`\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic, unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to dimerization through hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This makes options C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates and rules out A (aldehyde/phenol) and B (phenyl chloroformate).\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a singlet integrating to one proton, located in a very downfield region. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data and eliminates options A and B.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:**\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Another doublet signal integrating to two protons.\n*   **Interpretation of Aromatic Region:** The aromatic region of the spectrum shows a highly symmetrical pattern. The presence of only two signals, both of which are doublets and each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Final Candidates (C and D):**\n\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It has no plane of symmetry that simplifies the proton signals. It would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region for the four different aromatic protons, which would be a much more complex pattern than what is observed.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring.\n    *   It has the required carboxylic acid and chlorine atom.\n    *   Its molecular weight is 156.\n    *   It possesses the necessary symmetry to produce two doublets in the ¹H NMR spectrum, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -Cl group are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure. The mass spectrum indicates a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of the ¹H NMR definitively shows a para-substitution pattern. Therefore, the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (for the most abundant isotopes).\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (m/z=156) to the M+2 peak (m/z=158) is 100% to 32%, which is approximately a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**. (The natural abundance of Chlorine-35 is ~75% and Chlorine-37 is ~25%).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know the molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these pieces, the structure must be a benzoic acid molecule with a chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring at the para (or 4-) position. This leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check the proposed structure against the options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This would show a more complex pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid and would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would have different IR and ¹H NMR signals.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight for the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol. It is a carboxylic acid with a para-substituted benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence rules out Phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which is an aldehyde and a phenol. Phenolic -OH peaks are typically broad but usually don't extend as low as 2700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ = 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitively a proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This further confirms the IR analysis and rules out options A and D. The signal is a singlet because carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **δ = 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and δ = 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H). This highly symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) has an *ortho* substitution pattern, which would result in four distinct aromatic proton signals with more complex splitting (not two simple doublets).\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) has a *para* substitution pattern. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data, giving two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR and ¹H NMR confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR aromatic region pattern confirms a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion peak, is called the M+2 peak. The relative intensity of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This specific 3:1 ratio is a tell-tale sign for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule, as chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (approx. 75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (approx. 25% abundance).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position, coupled with the O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The conjugation with an aromatic ring slightly lowers the frequency to this range.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with and often exchanges too rapidly to show coupling. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4 aromatic protons. This means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of **1,4-disubstitution (para-substitution)** on a benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two on the other, giving two signals. They appear as doublets because each proton is split by its single ortho neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**Synthesis and Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **From the data:** We are looking for a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is a benzoic acid (has -COOH) with a chlorine atom at the para (4) position.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 for the ³⁵Cl isotope. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Correct)\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a -COOH proton and a para-disubstituted ring, which would give two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. (Correct)\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. The ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two doublets. (Incorrect)\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the -COOH proton at ~11 ppm and would not show the very broad IR stretch from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the IR peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11 ppm.

The ratio of the intensities of the M⁺ to M⁺+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine (Cl) atom, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

While it has the correct formula and functional groups, its *ortho* substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic signals, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This molecule is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe most reasonable structural suggestion is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound based on its most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the molecular ion peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options, using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n        *   All four options (A, B, C, D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   The M+2 peak would be from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. This eliminates none of the options, but confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This value is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This strongly supports options A and D, and rules out options B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride/ester which lacks the O-H group) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol, which would have a different C=O stretch and a phenolic O-H stretch, not the very broad carboxylic acid O-H).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The singlet multiplicity is also expected. This further supports options A and D.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern in the aromatic region is crucial. Having only two signals, both of which are doublets and integrate to 2 protons each, indicates a highly symmetric, para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring's axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two on the other side.\n        *   **Structure A (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern: two doublets, each representing 2 protons.\n        *   **Structure D (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments relative to the two different substituents. This would result in a more complex pattern, likely with four separate signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H. It would not produce two doublets of 2H each.\n\n*   **Final Synthesis:**\n    *   The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine.\n    *   The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The aromatic region of the NMR (two doublets of 2H each) confirms a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) fits all of these spectral data points.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires combining information from multiple spectroscopic techniques. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This indicates the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n    *   This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75%, and ³⁷Cl is ~25%).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimerization.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This immediately makes options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid) the most likely candidates, while ruling out A (phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride) and D (3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Peak at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**O**H). The integration confirms it is a single proton (1H). It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Peaks in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm):** There are two distinct signals.\n        *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity means they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** A signal for two other equivalent aromatic protons. The doublet multiplicity also indicates they are coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   This pattern—two doublets, each integrating to two protons—is a classic signature for a *para*- (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the ring makes the two protons on one side equivalent to the two protons on the other.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (no carboxylic acid).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid, consistent with IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR peak. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. This lack of symmetry means there would be four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid.\n        *   **MS:** Molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's calculate the MW: (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches. It contains Cl, also a match.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid. This matches.\n        *   **NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm). It has a *para*-disubstituted ring, which would produce the observed symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Ruled out by IR and NMR (it's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be different).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic version of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a second peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak. The ratio of the peak heights (M⁺ to M⁺+2) is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** This 3:1 ratio for an M⁺ and M⁺+2 peak is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule (Chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   We can confirm the molecular weight of the options. All proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight corresponding to the MS data.\n    *   C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 g/mol.\n*   The MS data confirms the molecular formula is likely C₇H₅ClO₂ but doesn't differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which form dimers.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of the C=O bond stretch. The position at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks is a definitive signature for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to rule out options that do not contain a carboxylic acid, such as **(A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and **(D) Phenyl chloroformate** (which is an acid chloride / ester).\n\n### **3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: **(B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **(C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The NMR spectrum will distinguish between them.\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   We have two signals in the aromatic region: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   The total integration is 4 protons, which is correct for a chlorobenzoic acid (C₆H₄ + COOH + Cl).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. This symmetry means the two protons next to one substituent are chemically identical, and the two protons next to the other substituent are also chemically identical.\n    *   **In 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, the COOH is at C1 and the Cl is at C4. The protons at C2 and C6 are equivalent, and the protons at C3 and C5 are equivalent. This creates the observed \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern.\n    *   **In 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, the substituents are adjacent (at C1 and C2). This removes the molecule's symmetry. All four aromatic protons would be in different chemical environments, leading to four separate and more complex signals, not the simple pattern observed.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   The IR confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n*   The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, most importantly, indicates a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) aromatic ring structure.\n\nCombining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the nominal molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to the 3:1 ratio characteristic of a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to its natural isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with abundances of ~75.8% and ~24.2% respectively).\n    *   So, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group's stretch. This specific frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the far downfield region, which is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and it's a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The splitting pattern provides crucial information about the substitution on the benzene ring. Having two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent to each other, resulting in two distinct signals.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope), contains one chlorine atom, possesses a carboxylic acid group, and has a *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring. All spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are perfectly consistent with this structure. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be the more downfield signal (8.02 ppm), and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be the slightly more upfield signal (7.72 ppm).\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight and functional group, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a much more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region, with four unique proton signals, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR would show an aldehyde proton signal (around 9-10 ppm) instead of the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm. The IR spectrum would also be different.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acid chloride derivative (a chloroformate). It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the ¹H NMR peak at 11.0 ppm. Its C=O IR stretch would also be at a higher frequency (>1775 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion:** All evidence points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires interpreting several types of spectroscopic data. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%). This M⁺ to M⁺+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   So, we are looking for a compound containing one chlorine atom with a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using ³⁵Cl). Let's check the options, which all have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are isomers and match the mass spectrometry data. We need to use the other spectra to differentiate them.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an acyl chloride and would lack the broad O-H) and C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol; while it has an O-H, it wouldn't be as broad as a carboxylic acid, and the carbonyl would be for an aldehyde). We are now left with options B and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7-8.5 ppm):** We have two signals in this region, which indicates the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   **The Aromatic Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry causes the two protons ortho to one substituent to be chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent to also be equivalent. This results in two sets of protons. Each set splits the other into a doublet.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n*   We have narrowed our choices down to 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho-substituted):** Would have 4 distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex pattern of multiplets, not two simple doublets.\n*   **4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-substituted):** This structure has the required 1,4-disubstitution pattern that gives rise to two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, combining all the evidence, the unknown compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 100:32 (or ~3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (Natural abundance: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. The molecular formula that fits this is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Calculation: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5, avg) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol.\n    *   With ³⁵Cl: 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   With ³⁷Cl: 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158.\n    This confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a classic, very distinctive peak for the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the characteristic range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the O-H peak, this corresponds to the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal far downfield, between 10-13 ppm, is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It is a singlet because it typically does not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The splitting pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para structure makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent equivalent. They split each other into two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains a benzene ring with two different substituents arranged in a para (1,4) configuration. One of those substituents is the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options\n\n*   **From MS:** We know the molecule is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **From IR and NMR:** We know it contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **From NMR:** We know the substituents are on a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThe pieces are: a benzene ring, a -COOH group, and a -Cl atom. Arranging them in a para configuration gives the structure **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It is an acyl chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H IR peak and the ¹H NMR signal at 11 ppm.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Perfect match.** It has the correct formula (C₇H₅ClO₂), the carboxylic acid functional group (explains IR and the 11 ppm NMR signal), and the para-substitution pattern (explains the two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is ortho-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets of 2H each.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would show an aldehyde proton signal (~9-10 ppm) instead of a carboxylic acid proton, and it has a phenolic -OH, not a carboxylic acid -OH.\n\nThe combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data (Mass Spectrometry, IR Spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR) to deduce the structure of an unknown compound from a given list of options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom. (Naturally occurring chlorine is a mixture of two isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance)).\n\nLet's verify the molecular formula and weight for the candidates. All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula: **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\n\nThe molecular weight calculation (using the most common isotopes, C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35) is:\n(7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = **156 g/mol**.\n\nThis matches the M+ peak. The presence of the ³⁷Cl isotope would give a molecular weight of 158, matching the M+2 peak. Therefore, the mass spectrometry data is consistent with all four options, confirming the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is a result of extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nThe combination of these two peaks is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** An acid chloride. Would lack the broad O-H stretch. Eliminated.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** A carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** A carboxylic acid. Consistent with IR data.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** A phenol (-OH) and an aldehyde (-CHO). A phenolic O-H is typically less broad (e.g., 3500-3200 cm⁻¹), and an aldehyde lacks the specific broadness down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This option is unlikely. Eliminated.\n\nBased on the IR data, the compound is either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides information about the different types of protons and their neighboring environment.\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It is a singlet (s) because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with, and it integrates to one proton (1H). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** correspond to the protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   The key information here is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n    *   This simple, symmetrical pattern arises from a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to one substituent are equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options based on this pattern:\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. It has no plane of symmetry, meaning all four aromatic protons are chemically unique. This would lead to a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It possesses the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly matches the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n1.  **MS** confirms the formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n2.  **IR** identifies the compound as a carboxylic acid.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring to be para (1,4-).\n\nThe only structure that fits all the evidence is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is M+2. The relative intensity is 32% (100:32 ratio is approximately 3:1). This distinct M/M+2 pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes exist in an approximate 3:1 natural abundance).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂):\n        *   (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This rules out options A (phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and C (an aldehyde, which would have a C=O peak but no carboxylic O-H, and its NMR would be different). We are left with options B and D.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in this region (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n        *   The signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   We have two signals: one doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H. This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   **Option B (2-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *ortho*-substituted. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to four separate, more complex signals (not two simple doublets).\n        *   **Option D (4-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *para*-substituted. This structure has a plane of symmetry. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the carboxylic acid group are equivalent and would appear as one signal. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and would appear as a second signal. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum of two doublets, each integrating to two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -Cl group are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data—the molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern from MS, the carboxylic acid signatures from IR, and the characteristic para-substitution pattern in the ¹H NMR—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n*   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The intensity ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1.\n*   This 3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   Let's check the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The mass would be (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. All four options provided have this molecular formula and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n*   A strong, sharp absorption peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   Combining these two observations, the IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   Let's evaluate the options based on the IR data:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Does not contain an O-H group. This is inconsistent.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. This is consistent.\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Contains a phenol -OH and an aldehyde C=O. A phenolic -OH is typically broad, but the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ range is the classic \"hairy beard\" appearance of a carboxylic acid O-H. This option is less likely.\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. This is consistent.\n*   Based on the IR data, the most likely candidates are B and D.\n\n**3. Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a signal in the very downfield region of the spectrum. It is a singlet and integrates to one proton. This is the characteristic chemical shift and multiplicity for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We see two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern indicates a highly symmetrical aromatic ring. Specifically, this is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent, as are the two protons on the other side. They couple with their neighbors to form two distinct doublets.\n*   Let's evaluate the remaining candidates (B and D) based on the NMR data:\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). It has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group at opposite ends of the benzene ring. This symmetry would produce exactly the observed pattern: two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). This substitution pattern removes the symmetry seen in the para isomer. The four protons on the aromatic ring would all be in chemically distinct environments, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four separate signals, likely multiplets), not two simple doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nAll three pieces of spectral evidence point to a single structure. The MS data indicates a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom. The IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and reveals a para-substituted benzene ring structure. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%.\n    *   The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl, ~75.8%, and ³⁷Cl, ~24.2%).\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of the proposed structures using the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl). The formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 35 + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n        *   The M+2 peak would come from the ³⁷Cl isotope: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + 37 + (2 × 16) = 158.\n    *   All four options have the correct molecular weight and would exhibit this isotopic pattern. So, the MS data confirms the molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This specific frequency is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the unknown compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid. This eliminates options C (which is an aldehyde and a phenol) and D (which is a chloroformate and has no O-H group). We are left with options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The 's' indicates it is a singlet (it does not couple with nearby protons), which is typical. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We have a total of four aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side. This creates an AA'BB' spin system that often appears as two distinct doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. Due to the lack of symmetry, all four aromatic protons would be chemically distinct and in different environments. We would expect to see a more complex splitting pattern with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets), not two simple doublets of 2H each. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom. This structure has the necessary symmetry to produce the observed NMR spectrum: two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two equivalent protons. The carboxylic acid proton would appear around 11 ppm. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of all the spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158, with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32 or ~3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options using the ³⁵Cl isotope. The molecular formula for all options is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   MW = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n    *   All four options are isomers and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding in the carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. A carbonyl in a conjugated carboxylic acid appears in the 1725-1700 cm⁻¹ range.\n    *   These two peaks together are a strong indication that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Evaluating the options:\n        *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. Consistent.\n        *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Contains a carboxylic acid group. Consistent.\n        *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Has an aldehyde (C=O) and a phenol (O-H). The O-H stretch of a phenol is broad, but typically not as broad as a carboxylic acid (usually 3500-3200 cm⁻¹). The IR is less consistent with this option.\n        *   D) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acid chloride/ester. It lacks an O-H group, so it would not have the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. The carbonyl peak for an acid chloride is also at a higher frequency (around 1800 cm⁻¹). This option is inconsistent with the IR data.\n    *   The IR data strongly suggests the compound is either 4-chlorobenzoic acid or 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal appearing at such a high chemical shift (δ > 10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet as it doesn't couple with other protons and integrates to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** We have two signals in the aromatic region:\n        *   8.02 ppm (d, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (d, 2H)\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents are electronically different, leading to two distinct chemical environments for the aromatic protons.\n        *   The protons labeled Ha are ortho (adjacent) to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, making them more deshielded and shifting them further downfield (8.02 ppm). They are split into a doublet by the adjacent Hb protons.\n        *   The protons labeled Hb are ortho to the chlorine atom, which is less electron-withdrawing than the carboxylic acid group. They are therefore more shielded (further upfield at 7.72 ppm) compared to Ha. They are split into a doublet by the adjacent Ha protons.\n    *   Let's check the remaining options against this NMR pattern:\n        *   A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) molecule. It would produce exactly the observed pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. This is a perfect match.\n        *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) molecule. It would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets). This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   All three pieces of spectral data (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak). The intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak is 32/100, which is approximately 1/3.\n*   This characteristic M+ and M+2 peak pattern with a ~3:1 ratio is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n*   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak is observed from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n*   A strong, sharp absorption peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, specifically within the typical range for a carboxylic acid (1725-1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration (1H) confirms one such proton. It is a singlet because it does not typically couple with other protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate the presence of protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents two chemically equivalent protons on the benzene ring. The fact that it is a doublet means it is split by a single neighboring proton.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents another pair of two chemically equivalent protons. It is also a doublet, indicating it is split by a single neighboring proton.\n*   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two distinct sets of equivalent protons, and each set is adjacent to the other, causing them to split each other into doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid containing a chlorine atom attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would show an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm) and a complex pattern for three aromatic protons, not the para-substitution pattern observed. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom, which matches the MS and IR. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be equivalent in pairs and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** Its formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches perfectly. The presence of one chlorine atom explains the M+2 peak.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the broad O-H and sharp C=O peaks.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which gives the exact pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. The carboxylic acid proton matches the signal at 11.0 ppm. This structure is a perfect fit for all the provided data.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\n*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak), which is about one-third (32%) the intensity of the M+ peak.\n    *   This characteristic M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75.8% for ³⁵Cl and ~24.2% for ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, Phenyl chloroformate) have the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   The molecular weight is calculated as: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   For the ³⁷Cl isotope, the weight would be 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹), often slightly higher due to conjugation or electron-withdrawing substituents.\n    *   Based on these two key peaks, the compound must be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This allows us to eliminate option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is a phenol and an aldehyde. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the O-H stretch of a phenol is typically less broad (~3600-3200 cm⁻¹), and the very broad peak down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is the classic sign of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   We can also eliminate option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an acid chloride/ester hybrid. It has a C=O bond but no O-H group, so it would not show the broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both remaining options A and B.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key to determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. We see two distinct signals:\n        *   8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n    *   This pattern, two doublets each integrating to two protons, indicates a highly symmetric, 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's examine the remaining structures:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It has no such plane of symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would give rise to a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals. This does not match the data.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It possesses the required symmetry. The two protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the -COOH group) are equivalent. The two protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the -Cl group) are equivalent. This structure would produce exactly two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a formula of C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The IR data identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data establishes a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Combining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes. So, the molecular mass is 156 u.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with an abundance of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a hallmark signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The two major isotopes of chlorine are ³⁵Cl (~75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2% abundance). The molecule containing ³⁵Cl has a mass of 156 u, and the one containing ³⁷Cl has a mass of 158 u. The ratio of their abundances (~76:24) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 u and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The wide range is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs in carboxylic acid dimers.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Specifically, a carbonyl in a conjugated aromatic carboxylic acid appears around 1720-1680 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both the very broad O-H and the C=O stretch strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm region is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. It is a singlet because acidic protons typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange with trace amounts of water.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. In such a symmetrical ring, the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side. This creates two sets of equivalent protons, which split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data:**\n\n1.  **MS** tells us the compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (Molecular Mass = 7\\*12 + 5\\*1 + 35 + 2\\*16 = 156).\n2.  **IR** tells us the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.\n3.  **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and tells us the benzene ring is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this synthesis:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** Chlorine and carboxylic acid are at the 1 and 4 (para) positions on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Fits MS:** Yes, M=156 with one Cl.\n    *   **Fits IR:** Yes, it is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Fits NMR:** Yes, it has the acidic proton (~11 ppm) and the para-substitution pattern (two doublets, each 2H). This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is not a carboxylic acid, and the 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring would give a more complex NMR signal (three distinct aromatic protons), not two doublets.\n\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. The lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic proton signals, creating a complex multiplet, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester/acid chloride. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. It also lacks the acidic proton, so it would not have the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 amu (using the most abundant isotopes).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158 is the M+2 peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75.8% for ³⁵Cl and 24.2% for ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the proposed structures. The molecular formula for all options (A, B, C, D) is C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass is (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. All options are consistent with the MS data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This rules out Phenyl chloroformate (C), which lacks an O-H group, and makes 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D) less likely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)** is in the typical chemical shift range for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its high chemical shift (downfield) is due to deshielding, and it appears as a singlet because acidic protons often do not couple with neighboring protons due to rapid chemical exchange. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid and rules out options C and D. We are now left with A (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**. This pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted. This structure would exhibit this exact NMR pattern.\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. This would result in four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Combining all the evidence, the compound must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. It has the correct molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern (MS), the characteristic functional groups of a carboxylic acid (IR), and the specific NMR pattern of a para-substituted aromatic ring attached to a carboxylic acid (¹H NMR).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (natural abundance: ~75% ³⁵Cl, ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weight for the proposed structures using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl):\n*   Formula for A, B, and D (C₇H₅ClO₂): (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   Formula for C (C₇H₅ClO₂): Same as above, 156 g/mol.\nAll options are consistent with the molecular weight and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected around 1725-1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This immediately makes options C (Phenyl chloroformate, an ester/acid halide) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde/phenol) highly unlikely. The evidence strongly points toward a chlorobenzoic acid (A or B).\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH). The 's' (singlet) indicates it has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is expected. The integration '1H' confirms it represents one proton. This further supports the conclusion that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both of which are doublets ('d'). The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H on the aromatic ring. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   Based on all the data, the compound is a carboxylic acid containing one chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring.\n*   The NMR data specifically indicates a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n*   Let's compare the remaining options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, which would produce two doublets in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This has an *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, all evidence points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with its most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is the M+2 peak. The intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak is 32/100, which is approximately 1:3.\n    *   This characteristic M+ to M+2 ratio of 3:1 is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular formula with a mass of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. The python code confirmed that all options have a molecular weight of 156.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group. This eliminates options C (Phenyl chloroformate) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm** is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key. There are two signals, one at **8.02 ppm** and another at **7.72 ppm**.\n    *   Each signal is a doublet (d), meaning the protons giving rise to that signal are adjacent to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   Each signal integrates to two protons (2H), meaning there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons next to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons next to the other substituent also equivalent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring substituted with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The NMR data tells us the substitution pattern is para (1,4).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nLet's check the options again:\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted carboxylic acid. It fits all the data perfectly.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. It would give a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (four separate signals), not two doublets.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is not a carboxylic acid. It would not show the IR or NMR signals for the -COOH group.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. The spectral data would be different.\n\nThe only structure consistent with all the provided evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. Its relative abundance is 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M:M+2 ratio of approximately 100:32 (or roughly 3:1) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine (Cl) atom** in the molecule. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), which leads to this pattern.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ isotopologue) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and thus have a molecular weight of 156. Therefore, the MS data is consistent with all four options.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, C=O stretches for aromatic carboxylic acids appear around 1710-1680 cm⁻¹. This peak, in combination with the broad O-H stretch, provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (has an aldehyde and a phenol, but not a carboxylic acid).\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (The C=O stretch for a chloroformate is at a much higher frequency, ~1775 cm⁻¹, and it lacks an O-H group).\n*   We are now left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid), as both are carboxylic acids.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton**. The signal is a singlet (s) because this proton is not adjacent to any other protons to couple with. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The key to distinguishing between options A and D lies in the pattern of the aromatic protons (protons attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   We see a doublet at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.72 ppm (2H)**.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also chemically equivalent. This gives only two signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. It has no plane of symmetry, meaning all four aromatic protons are chemically different. This would result in a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals (likely multiplets), not a simple pair of doublets.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It has a plane of symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent protons, which perfectly explains the observed pattern of two doublets for 2H each. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and correspond to the 8.02 ppm signal, while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom correspond to the 7.72 ppm signal.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll pieces of spectral data point unambiguously to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown white solid.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes. We'll assume this corresponds to the molecule containing the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative abundance of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) gives a ratio of approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes: ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options. All proposed structures (2-chlorobenzoic acid, phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and very strong indicator of an O-H bond stretch within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns perfectly with the carbonyl group in a conjugated carboxylic acid (Ar-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both of these peaks strongly suggests the molecule is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate option (B) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride) and (C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde with a phenol group). We are left with options (A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and (D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton, which is typical for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The integration (1H) confirms it is one proton, and its singlet nature (s) is expected as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This further confirms our conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region. The splitting pattern is key.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para*-substituted ring results in only two unique types of aromatic protons.\n        *   The two protons next to one substituent are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The two protons next to the other substituent are also chemically equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons is split into a doublet by its single adjacent proton neighbor.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The spectrum indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nLet's compare the remaining options with the NMR data:\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. It has no symmetry plane passing through the bonds, so all four aromatic protons would be chemically different, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted ring. This structure has the required symmetry to produce two doublets, each for 2H, in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would cause the adjacent ortho protons to appear more downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\nAll pieces of evidence (MS, IR, and ¹H NMR) point conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**:\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The mass difference of 2 amu (158 - 156) and the intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak (32:100 or approximately 1:3) is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**:\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**:\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)**: This very downfield chemical shift is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet as it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**: These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent, as are the two protons on the other side, leading to this simplified pattern. The downfield shifts indicate the ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups (like -COOH and -Cl).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula and structure for each option against the spectral data. The data points towards a molecule with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for ³⁵Cl).\n\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate**: MW ≈ 172.5 g/mol. This does not match the mass spec data.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n        *   **MW**: C₇H₅ClO₂ -> (7×12)+(5×1)+35+(2×16) = 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: It is a carboxylic acid. Matches IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern**: It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. This perfectly matches the ¹H NMR aromatic signals (two doublets, each for 2H). The electron-withdrawing COOH group would cause the adjacent ortho protons to shift downfield (likely the 8.02 ppm signal), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be slightly less deshielded (the 7.72 ppm signal). This is a perfect match.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n        *   **MW**: 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: Carboxylic acid. Matches IR.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern**: *Ortho*-substituted. This would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not two simple doublets. Does not match NMR.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**:\n        *   **MW**: 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: Contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. This is inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal which are definitive for a carboxylic acid. Also, it only has 3 aromatic protons, which contradicts the integration of the NMR signals (2H + 2H = 4H).\n\n*   **Conclusion**:\n    All spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak), which is 32% as intense as the M+ peak. This ~3:1 ratio for M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. (35Cl has ~75% abundance, and 37Cl has ~25% abundance).\n*   *Conclusion*: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak stretching from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid** that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimer form.\n*   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   *Conclusion*: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical region for a **carboxylic acid proton**. The integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and the singlet (s) multiplicity is expected as this proton does not have any adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. This pattern arises because of the symmetry in the molecule, where the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Structure:**\n*   From MS, we know we have one Chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know we have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know these two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n*   Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**5. Verification and Elimination of Other Options:**\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   Molecular Weight (with 35Cl): (7*12)+(5*1)+(35*1)+(2*16) = 156. **Matches MS.**\n    *   Functional Group: Carboxylic acid. **Matches IR.**\n    *   Substitution Pattern: Para-substituted ring with an acidic proton. **Matches NMR.**\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. It would show four unique, complex signals in the aromatic region of the NMR, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride/ester. It lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a substituted aldehyde. It lacks the characteristic signals of a carboxylic acid (the extremely broad IR peak and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm). The NMR aromatic region would also be more complex.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is unequivocally 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. This is referred to as the M+2 peak.\n    *   The relative intensity of the M+2 peak (32%) compared to the M+ peak (100%) is approximately a 1:3 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The very broad absorption band from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, this value is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two IR features are strong evidence for the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly diagnostic for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COO**H**). It appears as a singlet (s) because it does not typically couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, each coupling with its neighbor to produce a doublet.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **Conclusion from data:** The molecule is a chlorobenzoic acid with a para substitution pattern. This means a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group are attached to a benzene ring at positions 1 and 4.\n*   **Checking the Molecular Formula:** A chlorobenzoic acid has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. Its molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches the mass spectrum perfectly.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which would have a more complex NMR spectrum. It's an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid (lacks the ~11 ppm NMR signal and characteristic broad IR). Incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound has a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group in a para (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the spectral data (MS, IR, and the characteristic NMR pattern). **Correct.**\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride derivative. It lacks the O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the 11 ppm NMR signal. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted (1,2) ring. The four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to a much more complex NMR splitting pattern than two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n\nThe only structure that fits all the evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of intensities, M+ : M+2 ≈ 100:32 ≈ 3:1, is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two main isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which results in this characteristic 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks in molecules containing one Cl atom.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's calculate the molecular formula. The formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight is (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu. This matches the M+ peak. The M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule with the ³⁷Cl isotope: 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 amu. So, the molecular formula is correct.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with the C=O stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid (conjugated system).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This evidence makes options C (aldehyde) and D (acid chloride) unlikely.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton. It's a singlet because it doesn't couple with other protons, and the integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The two signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Symmetry and Splitting:** There are only two signals for the four aromatic protons. Both signals are doublets (`d`) and each integrates to two protons (`2H`). This simple `d, 2H` + `d, 2H` pattern is indicative of a highly symmetrical *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and has a *para*-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\nLet's evaluate the options based on the combined data:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzoic acid. The four aromatic protons would be non-equivalent, leading to four distinct signals in the NMR, not two doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid. This structure fits all the data:\n    *   It's a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   Its molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ matches the MS data.\n    *   The *para* substitution pattern creates the symmetry needed for the `d, 2H` + `d, 2H` NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR and the very broad O-H stretch in the IR. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks the hydroxyl group entirely, so it wouldn't have the O-H signals in the IR or ¹H NMR. This is incorrect.\n\nThe only structure that is consistent with all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. The relative intensity ratio is M+ : M+2 ≈ 100 : 32, which simplifies to approximately 3:1.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** This 3:1 ratio for M+ and M+2 peaks is a characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl. Thus, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156. All the proposed options (chlorobenzoic acids, etc.) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Calculation: (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. The mass spectrometry data is consistent with a compound of formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, exceptionally broad absorption band for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option **C) Phenyl chloroformate**, which is an ester and would lack the broad O-H stretch. It also makes option **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** unlikely, as a phenolic O-H is typically less broad (e.g., 3500-3200 cm⁻¹) than a carboxylic acid O-H. The remaining plausible options are **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) (as it doesn't couple with other protons) confirms the -COOH group identified in the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals:** The remaining signals, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Symmetry and Pattern:** We see a total of four aromatic protons (2H + 2H = 4H). These protons are split into two distinct groups of two protons each. Both signals are doublets (d). This simple A₂B₂ pattern (often appearing as two doublets) is a classic indicator of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The substitution pattern on the benzene ring is *para*.\n    *   This result directly supports **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**, which has a para-substitution pattern.\n    *   This result rules out **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**, which has an *ortho*-substitution pattern. An ortho-substituted ring would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n    *   This also rules out **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**, which is trisubstituted and would only have three aromatic protons with a different, more complex splitting pattern.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion:**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques:\n*   MS indicates a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   IR indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure among the choices that fits all of these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This distinctive isotopic pattern is a classic indicator for the presence of a single **chlorine (Cl)** atom in the molecule, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is part of the carboxylic acid group. Aromatic carboxylic acids typically absorb in the 1710-1680 cm⁻¹ range, so 1720 cm⁻¹ is a very reasonable value.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet (s) because this proton rapidly exchanges and does not typically couple with other protons. The integration (1H) confirms it represents a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.72 ppm and 8.02 ppm):** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate protons on a benzene ring.\n*   **Splitting Pattern (d, 2H and d, 2H):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are doublets (d), and each integrates to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent. This results in just two signals for the four aromatic protons, appearing as two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### **Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Options**\n\nCombining all the clues:\n*   We have a **chlorine atom**.\n*   We have a **carboxylic acid group**.\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **para (1,4) arrangement**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this structure matches all the data and why other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has the correct molecular weight (156) but lacks a carboxylic acid. It would not show the broad O-H IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular weight, the ¹H NMR spectrum for an ortho-substituted ring would be much more complex, showing four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Has the correct molecular weight but is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the characteristic carboxylic acid signals in both IR and NMR spectra. The aromatic protons would also show a different, more complex pattern.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of 156 (with ³⁵Cl), matching the MS.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Substitution:** It is para-substituted, perfectly explaining the ¹H NMR pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields its neighboring protons more strongly, accounting for the more downfield doublet at 8.02 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown solid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotope of each element.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. Its relative intensity is 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%).\n*   **Interpretation:** This M⁺ and M+2 pattern, with an approximate intensity ratio of 3:1 (100:32), is a definitive indicator for the presence of a single **chlorine** atom in the molecule. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formulas of the options.\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35.5) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band that results from the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid**. The significant broadening is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate options A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid halide) and B (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde with a phenol). We are left with options C and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. It is a singlet because it does not have any adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals, both appearing as doublets and each representing two protons. This splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. In a para-substituted ring, symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n**4. Final Structure Determination:**\n\n*   We have narrowed the possibilities down to 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho-substituted) and 4-chlorobenzoic acid (para-substituted).\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum clearly shows the symmetrical pattern of a **para-substituted** ring. A 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho) would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n*   Therefore, the structure must be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is 2 mass units higher (M+2).\n    *   The intensity of the M+2 peak is 32% of the M⁺ peak (100%).\n    *   The M⁺ to M+2 ratio of 100:32 (approximately 3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes have natural abundances of approximately 75.8% and 24.2%, respectively, giving a ratio of ~3:1).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular weights of the options.\n        *   A) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   B) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   C) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n        *   D) C₇H₅ClO₂: 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. Matches.\n    *   All options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   There is a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. The broadness is a key feature.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch. The position is consistent with a conjugated carboxylic acid (an aromatic carboxylic acid).\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   This eliminates option A (which is a phenol and an aldehyde) and option C (which is a chloroformate, lacks an O-H group, and its C=O stretch would be at a much higher frequency, ~1780-1815 cm⁻¹).\n    *   We are now left with options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), both of which are carboxylic acids.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, which is the typical chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The 's' indicates it's a singlet (no adjacent protons, which is typical for acidic protons), and '1H' means it corresponds to one proton. This confirms the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet corresponding to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet corresponding to two protons.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The two substituents create a plane of symmetry, so there are only two types of aromatic protons. Each type has one neighbor, hence they appear as doublets.\n    *   Let's look at the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. It would produce exactly this pattern of two doublets for its four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing COOH group would be more deshielded (further downfield, 8.02 ppm), and the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be less deshielded (7.72 ppm). This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene ring. There is no plane of symmetry through the bonds. It would have four distinct aromatic protons, each with a different chemical shift, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., four signals, likely a combination of doublets, triplets, or doublet of doublets). This does not match the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the combined analysis of MS, IR, and especially the ¹H NMR data, the only structure that fits all the evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
