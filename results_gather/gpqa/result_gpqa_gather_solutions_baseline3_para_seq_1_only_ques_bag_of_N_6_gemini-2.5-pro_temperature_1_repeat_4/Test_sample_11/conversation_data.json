This energy is converted into the total energies of the muon ($E_{\\mu^+}$) and the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. The muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude ($p$).\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy**: The total energy of a particle is $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino (assumed massless): $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.

This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a breakdown of the problem:\n\n**1. Principles:**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. This means they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\n**2. Given Values:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (`m_pi`): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (`m_mu`): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of neutrino (`m_nu`): Assumed to be 0.\n\n**3. Energy Conservation Equation:**\n*   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` (since the pion is at rest)\n*   Final Energy (`E_final`): `E_mu` + `E_nu`\n*   So, `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nWhere `E_mu` is the total energy of the muon and `E_nu` is the total energy of the neutrino.\n\n**4. Momentum Conservation:**\n*   `p_mu` = `p_nu` (in magnitude)\n*   Let's call this momentum `p`.\n\n**5. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\n*   For the neutrino (massless): `E_nu² = (p*c)²` => `E_nu = p*c`\n*   For the muon: `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n**6. Solving the System:**\nWe can solve for the energies of the product particles. A key step is to rearrange the energy-momentum relation for the muon to find `(p*c)²`:\n`(p*c)² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nNow substitute `p*c = E_nu` into this equation:\n`E_nu² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the energy conservation, we have `E_mu = (m_pi * c²) - E_nu`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_nu² = [(m_pi * c²) - E_nu]² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu + E_nu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `E_nu²` terms cancel out. Rearranging to solve for `E_nu`:\n`2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu = (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu = [(m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (m_pi * c²)]`\n\n**7. Calculation:**\nUsing the provided values:\n*   `E_nu = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)`\n*   `E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n*   `E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n*   `E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n*   **KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow find the total energy of the muon using the conservation of energy:\n*   `E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n*   `KE_mu = E_mu - (m_mu * c²) = 109.8 - 105.7`\n*   **KE_mu = 4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches the values in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** This is a particle decay problem, which is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary. Therefore, its initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n    *   According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final system must also be zero. The final system consists of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu).\n    *   This means the muon and the neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c²`.\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   Therefore: `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`.\n\n4.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   For the muon (mu+): `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n    *   For the neutrino (nu): Neutrinos have a very small mass and are treated as massless in this context (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = pc`.\n\n5.  **Solving the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have a system of equations:\n        a) `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n        b) `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        c) `E_nu = pc`\n    *   From (c), substitute `pc` with `E_nu` in equation (b):\n        `E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   From (a), express `E_nu` in terms of `E_mu`: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `E_nu` into the previous equation:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c² - E_mu)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Now, expand the squared term and solve for `E_mu`:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + E_mu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   The `E_mu²` term on both sides cancels out:\n        `0 = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `E_mu` (the total energy of the muon):\n        `2(m_pi * c²)E_mu = (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        `E_mu = [ (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values: `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu * c² = 105.7 MeV`.\n    *   `E_mu = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n    *   This is the total energy of the muon. The question asks for the **kinetic energy (KE)**.\n    *   `KE_mu = E_mu - (m_mu * c²) = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV`.\n\n7.  **Finding the Neutrino's Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   From the conservation of energy: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   `E_nu = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV`.\n    *   Since the neutrino is considered massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    *   `KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`.\n\n8.  **Final Result:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is **4.12 MeV**.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is **29.8 MeV**.\n    *   This pair of values corresponds to option D.\n\nThe calculation was confirmed by the Python script execution in the previous step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Its initial total energy is its rest mass energy, E_initial = m_π * c².\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The products are a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   By conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p).\n*   The final total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_μ + E_ν.\n\n**3.

Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so KE_ν = pc.\n\n**4.

Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), `E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p` (in magnitude)\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n*   For the neutrino: The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero in this context.

Substituting this:\n    `(KE_mu + m_mu * c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\n**4. Solving for the Kinetic Energies:**\nWe now have a system of equations. Let's solve for the kinetic energies.\n\nFrom step 3, we know `p*c = KE_nu`. Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n`(KE_mu + m_mu * c^2)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side:\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 2*KE_mu*(m_mu*c^2) + (m_mu*c^2)^2 = (KE_nu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(m_mu*c^2)^2` term cancels out:\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 2*KE_mu*(m_mu*c^2) = (KE_nu)^2`\n\nFrom the conservation of energy in step 1, we have `KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`. Substitute this into the equation above:\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 2*KE_mu*(105.7) = (33.9 - KE_mu)^2`\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 211.4 * KE_mu = (33.9^2 - 2*33.9*KE_mu + (KE_mu)^2)`\n`(KE_mu)^2 + 211.4 * KE_mu = 1149.21 - 67.8 * KE_mu + (KE_mu)^2`\n\nThe `(KE_mu)^2` term cancels out. Now, solve for `KE_mu`:\n`211.4 * KE_mu + 67.8 * KE_mu = 1149.21`\n`279.2 * KE_mu = 1149.21`\n`KE_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nThis rounds to **4.12 MeV** for the muon's kinetic energy.\n\nNow find the neutrino's kinetic energy:\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 - 4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nThis rounds to **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino's kinetic energy.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.

Since the initial pion is stationary, this is a classic two-body decay problem. The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum, within the framework of special relativity.\n\n2.  **State the Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles (mu+ and nu) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n        *   `p_initial = 0`\n        *   `p_final = p_muon - p_neutrino = 0` => `p_muon = p_neutrino = p`\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where `p` is momentum, `m₀` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n        *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): The pion is at rest, so its energy is purely its rest energy, `m_pi * c²`.\n        *   Final Energy (`E_final`): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. `E_final = E_muon + E_neutrino`.\n        *   Therefore: `m_pi * c² = E_muon + E_neutrino`.\n\n3.  **Formulate Equations for Product Particles:**\n    *   **Neutrino (nu):** The neutrino is considered (or has a negligible) rest mass. So, `m_nu = 0`. Its energy is purely kinetic.\n        *   `E_nu² = (pc)² + (0 * c²)²` => `E_nu = pc`.\n        *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino is `KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu*c² = pc - 0 = pc`.\n\n    *   **Muon (mu+):** The muon has a rest mass `m_mu`.\n        *   `E_muon² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n        *   The kinetic energy of the muon is `KE_muon = E_muon - m_mu * c²`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknowns:**\n    We have a system of equations. We can substitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n    `m_pi * c² = E_muon + E_nu`\n    `m_pi * c² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²) + pc`\n\n    To solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's energy), we rearrange and square the equation:\n    `m_pi * c² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)`\n    `(m_pi * c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    `(m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n    The `(pc)²` terms cancel out:\n    `(m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) = (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n    Now, solve for `pc`:\n    `2(m_pi * c²)(pc) = (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n    `pc = [ (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   **KE of Neutrino:** `KE_nu = pc`. We can calculate this value directly using the given rest masses.\n    *   **KE of Muon:** From the conservation of energy, `E_muon = m_pi * c² - E_nu`. Since `KE_muon = E_muon - m_mu * c²`, we have:\n        `KE_muon = (m_pi * c² - E_nu) - m_mu * c²`\n        `KE_muon = m_pi * c² - pc - m_mu * c²`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    The provided code output confirms the calculations derived from these formulas.\n    *   Given: `m_pi*c² = 139.6 MeV`, `m_mu*c² = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   `pc = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6) = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2 = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`.\n    *   `KE_mu = 139.6 - 29.78 - 105.7 ≈ 4.12 MeV`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Therefore, the two product particles, the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum be `p`.\n    *   `p_μ = p`\n    *   `p_ν = p`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy**: The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion, `m_πc²`. This energy must be completely converted into the total energies of the two product particles.\n    *   `m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy**: The total energy of a particle is given by `E = √( (pc)² + (m_c²)² )`.\n    *   For the muon: `E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )`\n    *   For the neutrino (massless): `E_ν = pc`\n\n4.  **Calculation**: By substituting these relationships and solving the system of equations, we derived the formula for the neutrino's energy (and kinetic energy):\n    *   `KE_ν = E_ν = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2 * m_πc² ]`\n\n    And the kinetic energy for the muon is:\n    *   `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc² = (m_πc² - E_ν) - m_μc²`\n\n### Conclusion from the Code Output\n\nThe code executed these exact calculations with the given values:\n*   `m_πc² = 139.6 MeV`\n*   `m_μc² = 105.7 MeV`\n\nThe result was:\n*   **Kinetic Energy of muon (KE_μ) = 4.12 MeV**\n*   **Kinetic Energy of neutrino (KE_ν) = 29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nThese calculated values match option C.\n\n*   A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n*   B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n*   **C) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**\n*   D) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe solution is correct.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThis problem involves the two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve it, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n    *   Initial energy (E_i) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Initial momentum (p_i) = 0, because the pion is stationary.\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) moving away from each other.\n    *   Final energy (E_f) = Total energy of the muon (E_μ) + Total energy of the neutrino (E_ν).\n    *   Final momentum (p_f) = Momentum of the muon (**p_μ**) + Momentum of the neutrino (**p_ν**).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before must equal the total momentum after.\n    *   p_i = p_f\n    *   0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**\n    *   This implies that the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    *   |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before must equal the total energy after.\n    *   E_i = E_f\n    *   m_π c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is given by the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², where 'p' is its momentum and 'm' is its rest mass.\n\n*   For the **muon (μ⁺)**:\n    *   E_μ² = (p_μ c)² + (m_μ c²)²\n    *   E_μ² = (pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²\n\n*   For the **neutrino (ν)**:\n    *   The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (m_ν ≈ 0).\n    *   E_ν² = (p_ν c)² + (m_ν c²)²\n    *   E_ν² = (pc)² + 0\n    *   So, E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino has no rest mass, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν).\n\n**4.

Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves the decay of a particle at rest. The solution relies on two fundamental conservation laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the speeds of the product particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Set Up the Decay Reaction**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion ($\\pi^+$) is at rest.\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_{i}$): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_{i}$): Since it's at rest, its momentum is zero, $p_i = 0$.\n\n*   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$).\n    *   Final Energy ($E_{f}$): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, $E_f = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Final Momentum ($p_{f}$): The vector sum of the momenta of the two product particles, $p_f = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n$p_i = p_f = 0$\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\nThis means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p':\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n$E_i = E_f$\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass.\n*   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the neutrino: The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$). So, $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nNow, we solve for `pc` (the momentum term), which will allow us to find the kinetic energies.\n\n*   First, we rearrange the equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n*   Square both sides to remove the square root:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\n*   The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. We solve for `pc`:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Kinetic Energy (KE):** $KE = E_{total} - m_0c^2$.\n    *   **Neutrino's KE:** $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$.\n    *   **Muon's KE:** $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$. From energy conservation, we know $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc$. Therefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc) - m_{\\mu}c^2$.\n\n**6.

Principles**\nWe will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{\\pi^+} = 0$\n    *   $\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion since it is stationary. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$\n    *   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**2. Given Values**\n*   Rest mass energy of pion, $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy of muon, $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   The neutrino ($\\nu$) is considered massless, so its rest mass is zero, and its energy is purely kinetic ($E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$).\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nFor any particle, its total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) are related by:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n\n*   For the massless neutrino ($m_\\nu = 0$): $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is its kinetic energy: $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n*   For the massive muon: $E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$. Its kinetic energy is $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's use the conservation of energy equation:\n$m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nSubstitute $E_{\\nu} = pc$ and isolate $E_{\\mu^+}$:\n$E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc$\n\nSquare this equation:\n$E_{\\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\nNow, equate this with the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n$(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ term cancels from both sides. We can now solve for the momentum term, $pc$:\n$(m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc)$\n$2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis value, $pc$, is the kinetic energy of the massless neutrino.\n$KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nTo find the kinetic energy of the muon, we can use the fact that the total kinetic energy released (the Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies:\n$Q = KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 - m_{\\nu}c^2$\n$Q = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 0 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow we can find the muon's kinetic energy:\n$KE_{\\mu^+} = Q - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ($\\mu^+$): 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($\\nu$): 29.8 MeV\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThis is a classic problem in relativistic kinematics, specifically a two-body decay of a particle at rest.

According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. This means they must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    *   `p_muon = p_neutrino = p`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   `E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino`\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\n    *   For the stationary pion, its total energy is just its rest mass energy:\n        `E_pion = m_pion * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   For the muon:\n        `E_muon² = (p*c)² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   For the massless neutrino:\n        `E_neutrino² = (p*c)² + (0)²`  which simplifies to `E_neutrino = p*c`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Energies:**\n    *   From the neutrino's energy equation, we can see that its total energy is equal to its momentum multiplied by the speed of light (`p*c`). Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is entirely kinetic energy.\n        `KE_neutrino = E_neutrino = p*c`\n    *   Now, we substitute `p*c = E_neutrino` into the muon's energy equation:\n        `E_muon² = E_neutrino² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   From the conservation of energy, we can express `E_muon` in terms of `E_neutrino`:\n        `E_muon = E_pion - E_neutrino = (m_pion * c²) - E_neutrino`\n    *   Substitute this into the previous equation:\n        `((m_pion * c²) - E_neutrino)² = E_neutrino² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        `(m_pion * c²)² - 2(m_pion * c²)E_neutrino + E_neutrino² = E_neutrino² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   The `E_neutrino²` terms cancel.

We can calculate this using the formula derived above.\n    *   **Muon's Kinetic Energy (`KE_mu`):** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`. We also know from energy conservation that the total energy released (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the products: `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu`. The Q-value is the difference in rest mass energies: `Q = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2`.\n        *   Therefore, `KE_mu = (m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2) - KE_nu`.\n\n8.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python code has already performed this calculation.\n    *   `m_pi_c2 = 139.6` MeV\n    *   `m_mu_c2 = 105.7` MeV\n    *   From the code output:\n        *   `pc` (which is `KE_nu`) = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n        *   `KE_mu` = 4.12 MeV\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated values are:\n    *   `KE_mu` = 4.12 MeV\n    *   `KE_nu` = 29.8 MeV\n\n    This matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the calculation in the code:\n`pc = (139.6**2 - 105.7**2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`pc = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`pc = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`pc = 29.7839...`  So `KE_nu = 29.8 MeV`.\n\n`KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78`\n`KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78`\n`KE_mu = 4.12` MeV.\nThe calculations are correct.\n\nFinal answer corresponds to the calculated values. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation:** The decay of the pion `Pi(+)` into a muon `mu(+)` and a neutrino `nu` must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. The decay is represented as:\n    `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n2.  **Initial State:** The problem states that the pion `Pi(+)` is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its initial energy is its rest mass energy.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`): 0\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum of the products (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. For this to happen, the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.

Then, we will analyze the provided answers for consistency in their reasoning, calculations, and final conclusions.\n\n### Physics and Calculation (Ground Truth)\n\n1.  **Governing Principles:** The decay `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu` is governed by the conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Given Information:**\n    *   The initial pion (`Pi+`) is stationary.\n    *   Rest mass energy of `Pi+` ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest mass energy of `mu+` ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino (`nu`) is considered massless ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum, which we'll call `p`.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n4.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The initial energy (rest energy of the pion) must equal the sum of the total final energies of the products.\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n5.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy of a particle is given by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   For the massless neutrino: $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\n6.  **Derivation and Calculation:**\n    By substituting these relations into the conservation of energy equation and solving the system, we can derive the formula for the neutrino's energy (which is all kinetic):\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is then found from energy conservation:\n    $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = (139.6 - 105.7) \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    So, the correct kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** (rounded) for the neutrino.

Principles:**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. This means they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\n**2. Given Values:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (`m_pi`): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (`m_mu`): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of neutrino (`m_nu`): Assumed to be 0.\n\n**3. Energy Conservation Equation:**\n*   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` (since the pion is at rest)\n*   Final Energy (`E_final`): `E_mu` + `E_nu`\n*   So, `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nWhere `E_mu` is the total energy of the muon and `E_nu` is the total energy of the neutrino.\n\n**4. Momentum Conservation:**\n*   `p_mu` = `p_nu` (in magnitude)\n*   Let's call this momentum `p`.\n\n**5. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\n*   For the neutrino (massless): `E_nu² = (p*c)²` => `E_nu = p*c`\n*   For the muon: `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n**6. Solving the System:**\nWe can solve for the energies of the product particles. A key step is to rearrange the energy-momentum relation for the muon to find `(p*c)²`:\n`(p*c)² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nNow substitute `p*c = E_nu` into this equation:\n`E_nu² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the energy conservation, we have `E_mu = (m_pi * c²) - E_nu`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_nu² = [(m_pi * c²) - E_nu]² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu + E_nu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `E_nu²` terms cancel out.

Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary. Therefore, its initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n    *   According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final system must also be zero. The final system consists of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu).\n    *   This means the muon and the neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c²`.\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   Therefore: `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`.\n\n4.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   For the muon (mu+): `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n    *   For the neutrino (nu): Neutrinos have a very small mass and are treated as massless in this context (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = pc`.\n\n5.  **Solving the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have a system of equations:\n        a) `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n        b) `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        c) `E_nu = pc`\n    *   From (c), substitute `pc` with `E_nu` in equation (b):\n        `E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   From (a), express `E_nu` in terms of `E_mu`: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `E_nu` into the previous equation:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c² - E_mu)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Now, expand the squared term and solve for `E_mu`:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + E_mu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   The `E_mu²` term on both sides cancels out:\n        `0 = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `E_mu` (the total energy of the muon):\n        `2(m_pi * c²)E_mu = (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        `E_mu = [ (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values: `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu * c² = 105.7 MeV`.\n    *   `E_mu = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n    *   This is the total energy of the muon.

Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), `E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p` (in magnitude)\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n*   For the neutrino: The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero in this context. Therefore, its energy is entirely kinetic: `E_nu = p*c`.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe can now solve for the energies.\n\n*   Substitute `E_nu = p*c` into the energy conservation equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + p*c` => `p*c = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\n*   Substitute this expression for `p*c` into the energy equation for the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n*   Simplify by canceling `E_mu^2` and solving for `E_mu`:\n    `2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n*   However, it's simpler to first solve for `p*c` (which is `E_nu`), as derived in the initial reasoning step:\n    `p*c = E_nu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n**4.

The key principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum, within the framework of special relativity.\n\n2.  **State the Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, so its momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles (mu+ and nu) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n        *   `p_initial = 0`\n        *   `p_final = p_muon - p_neutrino = 0` => `p_muon = p_neutrino = p`\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where `p` is momentum, `m₀` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n        *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): The pion is at rest, so its energy is purely its rest energy, `m_pi * c²`.\n        *   Final Energy (`E_final`): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. `E_final = E_muon + E_neutrino`.\n        *   Therefore: `m_pi * c² = E_muon + E_neutrino`.\n\n3.  **Formulate Equations for Product Particles:**\n    *   **Neutrino (nu):** The neutrino is considered (or has a negligible) rest mass. So, `m_nu = 0`. Its energy is purely kinetic.\n        *   `E_nu² = (pc)² + (0 * c²)²` => `E_nu = pc`.\n        *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino is `KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu*c² = pc - 0 = pc`.\n\n    *   **Muon (mu+):** The muon has a rest mass `m_mu`.\n        *   `E_muon² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n        *   The kinetic energy of the muon is `KE_muon = E_muon - m_mu * c²`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknowns:**\n    We have a system of equations. We can substitute the energy expressions into the conservation of energy equation:\n    `m_pi * c² = E_muon + E_nu`\n    `m_pi * c² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²) + pc`\n\n    To solve for `pc` (which is the neutrino's energy), we rearrange and square the equation:\n    `m_pi * c² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)`\n    `(m_pi * c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    `(m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n    The `(pc)²` terms cancel out:\n    `(m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) = (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n    Now, solve for `pc`:\n    `2(m_pi * c²)(pc) = (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n    `pc = [ (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   **KE of Neutrino:** `KE_nu = pc`. We can calculate this value directly using the given rest masses.\n    *   **KE of Muon:** From the conservation of energy, `E_muon = m_pi * c² - E_nu`. Since `KE_muon = E_muon - m_mu * c²`, we have:\n        `KE_muon = (m_pi * c² - E_nu) - m_mu * c²`\n        `KE_muon = m_pi * c² - pc - m_mu * c²`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    The provided code output confirms the calculations derived from these formulas.\n    *   Given: `m_pi*c² = 139.6 MeV`, `m_mu*c² = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   `pc = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6) = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2 = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`.\n    *   `KE_mu = 139.6 - 29.78 - 105.7 ≈ 4.12 MeV`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Substitute this expression for `p*c` into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n4.  Expand the squared term:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi * c^2)*E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n5.  The `E_mu^2` terms on both sides cancel out.

We can solve this by applying the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n*   Decay process: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   The initial particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless (Rest mass ≈ 0).\n\n**Reasoning and Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. This means they must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    *   `p_muon = p_neutrino = p`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   `E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino`\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\n    *   For the stationary pion, its total energy is just its rest mass energy:\n        `E_pion = m_pion * c² = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   For the muon:\n        `E_muon² = (p*c)² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   For the massless neutrino:\n        `E_neutrino² = (p*c)² + (0)²`  which simplifies to `E_neutrino = p*c`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Energies:**\n    *   From the neutrino's energy equation, we can see that its total energy is equal to its momentum multiplied by the speed of light (`p*c`). Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is entirely kinetic energy.\n        `KE_neutrino = E_neutrino = p*c`\n    *   Now, we substitute `p*c = E_neutrino` into the muon's energy equation:\n        `E_muon² = E_neutrino² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   From the conservation of energy, we can express `E_muon` in terms of `E_neutrino`:\n        `E_muon = E_pion - E_neutrino = (m_pion * c²) - E_neutrino`\n    *   Substitute this into the previous equation:\n        `((m_pion * c²) - E_neutrino)² = E_neutrino² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        `(m_pion * c²)² - 2(m_pion * c²)E_neutrino + E_neutrino² = E_neutrino² + (m_muon * c²)²`\n    *   The `E_neutrino²` terms cancel.

We can calculate this using the formula derived above.\n    *   **Muon's Kinetic Energy (`KE_mu`):** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`. We also know from energy conservation that the total energy released (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the products: `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu`. The Q-value is the difference in rest mass energies: `Q = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2`.\n        *   Therefore, `KE_mu = (m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2) - KE_nu`.\n\n8.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python code has already performed this calculation.\n    *   `m_pi_c2 = 139.6` MeV\n    *   `m_mu_c2 = 105.7` MeV\n    *   From the code output:\n        *   `pc` (which is `KE_nu`) = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n        *   `KE_mu` = 4.12 MeV\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated values are:\n    *   `KE_mu` = 4.12 MeV\n    *   `KE_nu` = 29.8 MeV\n\n    This matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the calculation in the code:\n`pc = (139.6**2 - 105.7**2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`pc = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`pc = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`pc = 29.7839...`  So `KE_nu = 29.8 MeV`.\n\n`KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78`\n`KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78`\n`KE_mu = 4.12` MeV.\nThe calculations are correct.\n\nFinal answer corresponds to the calculated values. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation:** The decay of the pion `Pi(+)` into a muon `mu(+)` and a neutrino `nu` must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. The decay is represented as:\n    `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n2.  **Initial State:** The problem states that the pion `Pi(+)` is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its initial energy is its rest mass energy.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`): 0\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum of the products (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. For this to happen, the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this magnitude of momentum be `p`.\n    *   `p_mu = p`\n    *   `p_nu = p`\n\n4.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy must equal the total final energy. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n5.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: `E = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2)`, where `p` is momentum, `m` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For the muon (`mu+`): `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    *   For the neutrino (`nu`), we assume its rest mass is zero (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy is: `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c`.\n\n6.  **Solving for Momentum and Energy:** Now substitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n    We need to solve this equation for `p*c`, which represents the energy of the neutrino.\n    *   Rearrange the equation: `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    *   Square both sides: `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   Expand the left side: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   The `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   Solve for `p*c`: `p*c = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * m_pi * c^2]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of Neutrino:** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic.\n        `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`\n        `KE_nu = [(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2] / [2 * 139.6]`\n        `KE_nu = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2`\n        `KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 = 29.78 MeV`\n        Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n    *   **KE of Muon:** The total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is shared as kinetic energy between the products.\n        `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu`\n        The Q-value is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies:\n        `Q = (m_pi * c^2) - (m_mu * c^2 + m_nu * c^2) = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`\n        Now find the muon's kinetic energy:\n        `KE_mu = Q - KE_nu`\n        `KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78 = 4.12 MeV`\n        So, `KE_mu` is **4.12 MeV**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The kinetic energies of the product particles are 4.12 MeV for the muon (`mu+`) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (`nu`).

Applying the Laws to the Decay**\n\nThe decay is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n*   **Initial State:** The pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary (at rest).\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_i$) = 0\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_i$) = Rest Mass Energy of the pion = $m_{\\pi}c^2$\n\n*   **Final State:** The muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) are moving.\n    *   Let the momentum of the muon be $p_{\\mu}$ and the neutrino be $p_{\\nu}$. By conservation of momentum:\n        $p_i = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n        $0 = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n        This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: $p_{\\mu} = -p_{\\nu}$. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum '$p$'.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the two product particles:\n        $E_f = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total energy of any particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2}$, where $m_0c^2$ is its rest mass energy.\n\n**3. Setting up the Energy Equation**\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nLet's substitute the energy formulas for the muon and neutrino:\n*   $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Neutrinos ($\\nu$) are considered to be effectively massless in these calculations ($m_{\\nu}c^2 \\approx 0$). For a massless particle, the energy formula simplifies to $E = pc$. So, $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\nOur energy conservation equation becomes:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe now solve this equation to find the momentum '$p$' (or more conveniently, '$pc$'), and from there, we can find the kinetic energies.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Rest mass of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) of a particle is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n*   $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n*   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = E_{\\nu} - 0 = pc$\n\nLet's use the conservation of energy equation again:\n$E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\nSubstitute $E_{\\mu} = KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2$ and $E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$:\n$KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2 = m_{\\pi}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\nRearranging gives the total kinetic energy released:\n$KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n$KE_{total} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV\n\nThis means the sum of the kinetic energies of the two particles is 33.9 MeV.\n\nFrom the calculation performed by the code:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon ($KE_{\\mu}$) ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$) ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\nLet's check the sum: 4.12 + 29.8 = 33.92 MeV, which matches our calculation. The pair of values (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe initial reasoning, the derived formulas, and the Python code are correct.\n\nThe execution of the code provides the following results:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$): **29.78 MeV**\n\nThese values correspond to the kinetic energies of the two product particles. Now, we compare them with the given options:\n\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values of 4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV (which rounds to 29.8 MeV) directly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We can solve this using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The Pi(+) is at rest.\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_i$): 0\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_i$): The rest energy of the pion, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n\n*   **Final State:** The products are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Let the momentum of the muon be $p_{\\mu}$ and the momentum of the neutrino be $p_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Let the total energy of the muon be $E_{\\mu}$ and the total energy of the neutrino be $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before and after the decay must be equal.\n    $p_i = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$\n    $0 = p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu} \\implies p_{\\mu} = -p_{\\nu}$\n    This means the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude. Let this magnitude be $p$. So, $|p_{\\mu}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before and after the decay must be equal.\n    $E_i = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) for a particle is given by:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n    $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$):\n    The rest mass of a neutrino is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$).\n    $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    For a massless particle, its total energy is its kinetic energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n**4. Solve for the Energies**\n\nSubstitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\nNow, we solve for the momentum term, $pc$:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nCancel the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nRearrange to solve for $pc$:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu+ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n\nFirst, calculate the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu} = pc$):\n$KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNext, calculate the muon's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$). We know the total energy released is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products:\n$KE_{\\text{total}} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\nNote: This is incorrect. This formula is for the *Q-value* of a decay, but energy is not just kinetic when particles have rest mass. The total energy released is $m_{\\pi}c^2$, which is split between the rest energy and kinetic energy of the muon, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n\nThe correct way is using energy conservation again:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = (KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2) + KE_{\\nu}$\n$KE_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 - KE_{\\nu}$\n$KE_{\\mu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} - 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n$KE_{\\mu} = 4.1 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe Python script from the reasoning step confirms these calculations precisely:\nKE of mu(+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu: 29.78 MeV (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nComparing our calculated values (KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV, KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV) with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe problem has been solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum for relativistic particles.\n\nHere is a summary of the steps:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (π+) is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the product particles, the muon (μ+) and the neutrino (ν), must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (p).\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay (the rest mass energy of the stationary pion) must equal the total energy after the decay (the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino).\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy (E) is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_μ = sqrt[(pc)² + (m_μc²)²]\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc\n\n4.  **Calculation:** By substituting these relations into the energy conservation equation and solving for the momentum term `pc`, we get:\n    *   pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n5.  **Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is its total energy: KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy: KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc². This can also be found directly from the total energy conservation: KE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²) - KE_ν.\n\nThe Python script executed these calculations:\n*   Given m_πc² = 139.6 MeV and m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n*   The script first calculated `pc`, which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino.\n    *   pc = KE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV (rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n*   Then, it calculated the kinetic energy of the muon.\n    *   KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.78 MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles, a muon (${\\mu}^{+}$) and a muon neutrino (${\\nu}$), from the decay of a stationary positive pion (${\\pi}^{+}$).\n\n**1. Principles:**\nThis decay must conserve both energy and momentum. Since the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   Initial momentum ($p_{initial}$) = 0.\n*   Final momentum ($p_{final}$) = $p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu}$.\n*   For momentum to be conserved ($p_{initial} = p_{final}$), the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   $|\\vec{p_{\\mu}}| = |\\vec{p_{\\nu}}| = p$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   Initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = Rest energy of the pion = $m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n*   Final energy ($E_{final}$) = Total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$) + Total energy of the neutrino ($E_{\\nu}$).\n*   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino: We assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$), so its energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n*   Setting $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**4. Solving for Momentum (pc):**\n*   Rearrange the equation: $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Square both sides: $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Expand and simplify: $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    *   $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Isolate pc: $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**5. Calculating Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n*   **KE of Neutrino:** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    *   $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n*   **KE of Muon:** The total energy released (Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the products.\n    *   $Q = KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    *   Therefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2) - KE_{\\nu}$\n\n**Given Values:**\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\n**Calculation:**\nUsing the results from the executed Python code:\n1.  **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):** The calculation for `pc` yielded 29.78 MeV.\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV\n2.  **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):** The code calculated this as 4.12 MeV.\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 4.12$ MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe decay of a stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$) into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$) must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay is the rest mass energy of the stationary pion.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n\n    After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy for a particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy ($E = mc^2 + KE$).\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu}) + (m_{\\nu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu})$\n\n    Equating initial and final energy:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\nu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu}$\n\n    Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this context ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$).\n    So, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$\n\n    The total kinetic energy of the products is the difference between the rest mass energies of the initial and final particles (the Q-value of the reaction):\n    $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n3.  **Relativistic Calculation:**\n    We can relate a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\n    For the massless neutrino ($m_{\\nu}=0$):\n    $E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2 + 0 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n    Therefore, the neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy: $KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n    Now we can find the momentum, $pc$, using the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n    To solve for pc:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    Squaring both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Final Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   Kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n        $KE_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$ (or 29.8 MeV when rounded)\n\n    *   Kinetic energy of the muon:\n        $KE_{\\mu} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.
