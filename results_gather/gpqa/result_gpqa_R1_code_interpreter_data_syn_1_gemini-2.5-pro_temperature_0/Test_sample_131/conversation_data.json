    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons (likely methyl groups since they are singlets), with their total proton counts in a 2:1:1 ratio. The chemical shift around 2.2 ppm is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). They will produce **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons into a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons into a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet is inconsistent with the experimental data, which only shows singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the spectra of the remaining candidates in a 1:1 ratio to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. **This matches the experimental data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming they all have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
