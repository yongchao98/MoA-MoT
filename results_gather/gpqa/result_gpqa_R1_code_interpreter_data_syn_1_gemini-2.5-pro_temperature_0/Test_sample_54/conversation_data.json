    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons:**\nFirst, let's sum the integrations given in the NMR data:\n1H (from 7.0 ppm) + 1H (from 5.5 ppm) + 3H (from 2.1 ppm) + 3H (from 1.6 ppm) = 8 protons in total.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The molecular formula is CH₃COOCHCHCH₃. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The molecular formula would be, for example, CH₃COOCHCHCH₂CH₃. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10.\n\nSince the NMR spectrum shows a total of 8 protons, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and D). The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the NMR Signals:**\nThe remaining options are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃. Let's assign each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet (s), meaning the protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O). This is the acetyl methyl group (CH₃-COO-). This is consistent with an acetate structure.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a signal for three protons, so it must be a methyl group. It is a doublet (d), which means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is for one proton. It is a doublet of quartets (dq), meaning it is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet splitting) and to a group of three protons (giving the quartet splitting). This perfectly describes the proton in the -CH=CH-CH₃ part of the molecule. It is coupled to the other vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for one proton. It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This corresponds to the vinyl proton attached to the oxygen atom (-O-CH=CH-). This proton is highly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen, which explains its downfield chemical shift. The coupling is with the other vinyl proton.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The typical range for a **trans** coupling constant across a double bond is **12-18 Hz**.\n*   The typical range for a **cis** coupling constant across a double bond is **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a trans configuration. Therefore, the two protons on the double bond are in a trans relationship to each other.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the proton count, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and coupling constant all point to the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
