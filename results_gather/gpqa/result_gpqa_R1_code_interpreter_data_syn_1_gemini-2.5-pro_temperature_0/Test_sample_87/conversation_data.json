    "The user is describing an immunology experiment and asking to identify the underlying biological process. Let's break down the key pieces of information provided:\n\n1.  **Antigen and Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (a protein antigen) are delivered orally. This mimics a natural infection route for a gut pathogen.\n2.  **Location of Response:** The immune response is observed in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, crucial for initiating immune responses to gut antigens.\n3.  **Responding Cells:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ, antigen exposure leads to the proliferation of specific lymphocytes (B cells and T cells).\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" is sequenced. This gene is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibody it will eventually secrete.\n5.  **Key Observation:** \"High variability\" is found in this gene among the proliferating cells. This means that the sequences are not all identical but show numerous small differences.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this information:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that can be activated by pathogens to help clear them. It is part of the humoral immune system but does not involve genetic changes in B cells.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment is looking at a process happening *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ. While VDJ recombination is responsible for the initial diversity, it is not the cause of the *new* variability seen in the proliferating, antigen-selected population.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) after encountering an antigen. SHM introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (including the variable heavy chain). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different receptors. Cells with higher affinity for the antigen are then selected to survive and proliferate further. This process, known as affinity maturation, directly leads to \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cell population. This perfectly matches the experimental observations.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the constant region of the heavy chain, which determines the antibody's effector function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA, which is important for mucosal immunity). However, CSR does *not* alter the variable region of the heavy chain. Therefore, it is not responsible for the observed variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
