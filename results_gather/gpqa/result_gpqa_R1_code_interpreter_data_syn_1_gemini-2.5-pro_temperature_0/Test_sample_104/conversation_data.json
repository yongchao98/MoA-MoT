    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe main goal is to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that would cause the same brightness drop as the rotational modulation of a star with spots. This means we need to:\na. Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's spots.\nb. Calculate the brightness drop (transit depth) caused by an exoplanet.\nc. Equate these two values and solve for `R_pl / R_star`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Variation from Spots**\n\nThe star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted hemisphere. The amplitude of this variation is the relative difference in flux between these two states, normalized by the maximum flux (from the unspotted side).\n\n*   **Flux:** According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy flux (F) emitted per unit area of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T): `F ∝ T⁴`.\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a temperature `T_eff`. So, `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. The visible disk is a composite of the normal photosphere and cooler spots.\n    *   A fraction `f_spot` (20% or 0.20) of the area emits at the spot temperature `T_spot`.\n    *   The remaining fraction `(1 - f_spot)` (80% or 0.80) emits at the star's effective temperature `T_eff`.\n    *   The total flux is the weighted average: `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation (A):** The amplitude is the fractional drop in brightness.\n    `A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `A = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    Substituting the expressions for flux:\n    `A = 1 - [((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n    `A = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n    `A = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n    `A = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Transit Depth from an Exoplanet**\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The transit depth (`δ`) is the fraction of the starlight that is blocked. For a uniform brightness star, this is simply the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   `δ = Area_planet / Area_star`\n*   `δ = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n*   `δ = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**4. Equate the Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the spot signal is the same as the transit depth of the hypothetical planet.\n\n*   `A = δ`\n*   `f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`:\n\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) )`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   `T_eff` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   `f_spot` = 0.20\n\nWe can use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters based on the problem description\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf_spot = 0.20    # Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots.\n# This is equivalent to the transit depth (delta) of the hypothetical planet.\n# delta = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\ndelta = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The transit depth is also related to the relative radii of the planet and star.\n# delta = (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(delta)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(delta)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3217908108194361\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3218.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
