    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **NaH (Sodium Hydride):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **BnBr (Benzyl Bromide):** An electrophilic alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The sodium alkoxide formed is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. The alcohol group is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The benzyl group (Bn) acts as a protecting group for the alcohol.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide in a condensation reaction (similar to imine formation) to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-BuLi (n-butyllithium):** A very strong base. Two equivalents are typically used.\n    2.  **Aqueous NH₄Cl:** Used for workup to protonate the intermediate.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene.\n    *   The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    *   The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    *   The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as p-toluenesulfinate anion), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The aqueous NH₄Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone group is effectively removed and replaced by a C=C double bond in the ring. The original C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes part of this new double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (the exact position of the double bond could be C1-C2 or C1-C6, but this does not affect the final product's constitution).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ gas and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which has two effects here:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane\n        *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzyl group is broken, and the oxygen is protonated to form an alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        *   -CH₂OBn → -CH₂OH\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The relative 1,3-positioning of these substituents on the ring is maintained throughout the synthesis. The name of this compound is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, which is an intermediate (related to Product 2), not the final product.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product. It has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure is incorrect. It contains a butyl group (from n-BuLi acting as a nucleophile, which doesn't happen in a Shapiro reaction) and retains the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by hydrogenation.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the benzyl ether of the final product. It would be the result if the hydrogenation did not cleave the protecting group, which is incorrect for Pd/C catalysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
