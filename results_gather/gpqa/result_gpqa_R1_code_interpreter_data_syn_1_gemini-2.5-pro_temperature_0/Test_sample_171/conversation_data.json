    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the population of different energy levels and temperature is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state `j` (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `i` (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(- (E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n    Where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Interpret the problem statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the population in the lower state (`N_j / N_i`) is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    Let `R(T) = N_j / N_i` be the excitation ratio at a given temperature `T`.\n    The problem gives us:\n    `R(T_1) = 2 * R(T_2)`\n    Where `T_1` is the temperature of star_1 and `T_2` is the temperature of star_2.\n\n4.  **Set up the equation using the Boltzmann formula:**\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n7.  **Rearrange the equation:** We want to find an expression for `ln(2)`, so we rearrange the terms:\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Factor and simplify the expression:** Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n9.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem states that the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately `1.38 x 10^-23 J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`.\n    Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    So, the constant of proportionality `(ΔE / k)` is approximately `1 K`.\n\n10. **Final form of the equation:** Substituting this value back into our derived equation gives:\n    `ln(2) ≈ (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n11. **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n    B) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]`\n    C) `ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]`\n    D) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n\n    Our derived relationship has the functional form `(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`. This matches option D. Although the equation in option D is dimensionally inconsistent (a dimensionless number `ln(2)` is equated to a term with units of `1/Temperature`), it is the only option that correctly represents the physical relationship derived from the Boltzmann equation. It is likely that the constant factor `ΔE/k ≈ 1 K` was omitted for simplicity in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
