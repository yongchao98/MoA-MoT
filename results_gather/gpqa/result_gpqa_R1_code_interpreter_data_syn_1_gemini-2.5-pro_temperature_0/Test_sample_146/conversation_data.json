    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The reaction is:\n    $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:** In any particle interaction, energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   We have a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can approximate its initial momentum as zero.\n    *   Typically, in such an experiment, the proton would be part of a stationary target (e.g., liquid hydrogen). Therefore, we assume the proton is at rest.\n    *   **Initial Momentum:** Since both the proton and the antiproton are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n        $\\vec{P}_{initial} \\approx 0$\n    *   **Initial Energy:** The total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The kinetic energies are negligible.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton} = (m_p c^2) + (m_{\\bar{p}} c^2)$\n    *   A proton and an antiproton have the same mass. The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   We have four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. They all have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The rest energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Final Momentum:** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n        $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{A^+_1} + \\vec{p}_{A^+_2} + \\vec{p}_{A^-_1} + \\vec{p}_{A^-_2} = 0$\n    *   **Final Energy:** The total final energy is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four A particles. The total relativistic energy of a single particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the final particles must be created in a way that their momenta cancel out. The most symmetric and simplest outcome is that they all fly apart with the same speed, $v$, and thus have the same energy, $E_A$.\n        $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Equate Initial and Final Energy:**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Velocity:**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the given values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n\nTo get a precise result, we can use a short python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27\n\n# Rest energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# From conservation of energy: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now solve for beta (v/c) using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\n\n# The velocity is v = beta * c\n# We print the result to two decimal places to match the options.\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n\nThe calculation shows that the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of relativistic energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume it is at rest.\n*   The proton is typically part of a stationary target, so we assume it is also at rest.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical: $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   All four particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum was zero), the four particles must fly apart with some velocity, $v$. By symmetry, it's reasonable to assume they all have the same speed.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is its relativistic energy, $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n*   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**4. Solving for Velocity**\n\n*   Now, we equate the initial and final energies:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n*   We can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\n*   Substitute the known energy values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n\n*   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$\n\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated velocity is 0.77c.\n\n<<<D>>>"
