    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting the same star. The ratio is expressed as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n- $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we must first find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n**4. Use Radial Velocity Data to Find the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) for each planet, which is used to determine the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, K.\nThe relationship is:\n$K = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} c$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} / \\lambda_0) c}{(\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} / \\lambda_0) c} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). The detection by the transit method implies an orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ ($\\sin i \\approx 1$). The formula, assuming $M_p \\ll M_*$, is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} v_p \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} v_p$\nwhere $v_p$ is the planet's orbital velocity. The orbital velocity is determined by the gravitational force from the star:\n$v_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nSubstituting $v_p$ into the equation for K:\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe gravitational constant G and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\nWe are given the following values:\n- $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n- $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 0.03$ Å\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 0.04$ Å\n\nFirst, calculate the ratios of mass and RV semi-amplitude:\n- $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNext, substitute these ratios into the equation for $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a short Python script.\n```python\n# Given values\nMp1 = 7.0  # Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nMp2 = 5.0  # Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# Ratio of masses\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = Mp2 / Mp1\n\n# Ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = a_ratio_2_over_1**0.5\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio_1_over_2}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n- $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio for the two planets:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the star's wobble caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this wobble, $K$, is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) by $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) and assuming the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_*$), the semi-amplitude $K$ is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since the planets were also detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The equation becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ are the same for both and cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**4. Substituting Values and Calculating the Final Ratio**\n\nWe are given:\n- $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n- $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 0.03$ Å\n- $\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 0.04$ Å\n\nFirst, we find the necessary ratios:\n- Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- RV semi-amplitude ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the decimal value, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nMp1 = 7.0  # Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nMp2 = 5.0  # Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# Ratio of masses (Mp2/Mp1)\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = Mp2 / Mp1\n\n# Ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio_1_over_2}\")\n```",
    "The final calculation from the Python script gives the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as approximately 0.5357.\n\nLet's review the steps:\n1.  The ratio of equilibrium temperatures, assuming the same star and same albedo, simplifies to $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$.\n2.  The ratio of the semi-major axes was derived from the radial velocity formula as $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$.\n3.  The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$).\n4.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n5.
