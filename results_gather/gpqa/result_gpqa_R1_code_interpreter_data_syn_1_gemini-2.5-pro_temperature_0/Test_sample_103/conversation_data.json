    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star wobbles as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n    The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight:\n    $\\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The maximum observed shift, $(\\Delta \\lambda)_{max}$, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    Therefore, $K \\propto (\\Delta \\lambda)_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   $(\\Delta \\lambda_1)_{max} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $(\\Delta \\lambda_2)_{max} = 7$ miliangstrom\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is the same as the ratio of these shifts:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = (\\Delta \\lambda_2)_{max} / (\\Delta \\lambda_1)_{max} = 7 / 5 = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:**\n    For a star of mass $M_s$ and a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit of period $T$, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity $K$ can be expressed as:\n    $K = \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_s+m_p} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G (M_s+m_p)}{T} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_s$), we can simplify this to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_s} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G M_s}{T} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    We can rearrange the terms to see the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_s^{2/3} T^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Proportionality to the Two Systems:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   We can reasonably assume the orbital inclinations are statistically similar or that the problem implies they are the same for a direct comparison. So, we assume $\\sin(i_1) = \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    With these conditions, the terms $m_p$, $M_s$, and $\\sin(i)$ are constant for both systems. The relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods ($T_2 / T_1$):**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio for the two systems:\n    $K_2 / K_1 = (T_2 / T_1)^{-1/3} = (T_1 / T_2)^{1/3}$\n    We want to find $T_2 / T_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    First, cube both sides:\n    $(K_2 / K_1)^3 = T_1 / T_2$\n    Then, take the reciprocal:\n    $T_2 / T_1 = (K_1 / K_2)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the amplitudes we found in step 2 ($K_2 / K_1 = 7/5$, so $K_1 / K_2 = 5/7$):\n    $T_2 / T_1 = (5 / 7)^3$\n    $T_2 / T_1 = 5^3 / 7^3 = 125 / 343$\n\n    To find the numerical value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (T2/T1).\n# This is given by (K1/K2)^3, where K1/K2 is the ratio of the RV amplitudes.\n# The ratio of RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts, which is 5/7.\n\nratio_of_periods = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_of_periods)\n```\n\n>>>0.3644314868804665\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
