    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to determine which of the two planets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star and to quantify the ratio of their probabilities.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, this is given by:\n    `Prob = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We need to compare the probability of Planet_1 (Prob_1) to the probability of Planet_2 (Prob_2).\n    *   `Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    *   `Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    The ratio is `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information:**\n    *   We are told that both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n    *   Substituting this into the ratio simplifies it: `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s1 / a_2) = a_2 / a_1`.\n    *   This means the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Physical Properties:** To find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion:\n    `P^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `M_s` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** Rearranging Kepler's Third Law to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 = (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n    `a = [ (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    Since `G` and `4 * π^2` are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can calculate the ratio `a_2 / a_1` using the proportionality:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Substitute the Remaining Given Information:**\n    *   The mass of Star_1 is twice the mass of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P1 = P2 / 3`. This implies `P1^2 = (P2 / 3)^2 = P2^2 / 9`.\n\n    Substitute these into the ratio equation:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P2^2 / 9) ) ]^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   Cancel out the common terms `M_s2` and `P2^2` from the numerator and denominator:\n        `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2 * (1/9)) ]^(1/3)`\n        `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3)`\n        `a_2 / a_1 = [ 9 / 2 ]^(1/3)`\n        `a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Value:** The ratio of probabilities `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is equal to `a_2 / a_1`. We need to compute the cube root of 4.5. A simple python script can do this accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the transit probabilities is equal to (4.5)^(1/3).\n# Let's calculate this value.\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.650964011364532\n</execute_code>\n\n11. **Interpret the Result:** The calculation shows that `Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65`. This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n12. **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) Planet_2 is preferred... (Incorrect)\n    *   B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability... (Incorrect factor)\n    *   C) Planet_2 is preferred...

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 and determine which is higher and by what factor.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`), assuming a random orbital inclination. For circular orbits, this is:\n    `Prob = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We need to find the ratio of the probability for Planet_1 (`Prob_1`) to the probability for Planet_2 (`Prob_2`).\n    `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n    *   Substituting this into the ratio equation simplifies it significantly. The term `(R_s1 / R_s2)` becomes 1.\n    *   `Ratio = 1 * (a_2 / a_1) = a_2 / a_1`\n    *   This crucial simplification shows that the ratio of the transit probabilities is simply the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes. To find which planet is more likely to transit, we need to compare their orbital distances.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) and its semi-major axis (`a`) to the mass of its host star (`M_s`):\n    `P^2 = (4 * π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`):** We can rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for `a`:\n    `a^3 = (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n    `a = [ (G * M_s * P^2) / (4 * π^2) ]^(1/3)`\n    Since `G` and `4 * π^2` are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a_2 / a_1`):** Using the proportionality, we can write the ratio as:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Substitute the Remaining Given Information into the Ratio:**\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice the mass of Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   The period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2: `P1 = P2 / 3`. This means `P1^2 = (P2 / 3)^2 = P2^2 / 9`.\n\n    Now, substitute these relationships into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / ( (2 * M_s2) * (P2^2 / 9) ) ]^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   Cancel the common terms `M_s2` and `P2^2` from the numerator and the denominator.\n        `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2 * (1/9)) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Simplify the fraction in the denominator:\n        `a_2 / a_1 = [ 1 / (2/9) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   Invert the fraction:\n        `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Value:** The ratio of the probabilities `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is equal to `a_2 / a_1`. We need to compute the cube root of 4.5.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the transit probabilities is Prob_1 / Prob_2 = a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3).\n# Let's calculate this value.\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.650964011364532\n</execute_code>\n11. **Interpret the Result and Select the Correct Option:** The calculation shows that the ratio `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is approximately `1.65`. This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    *   A) Planet_2 is preferred...
