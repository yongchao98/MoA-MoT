    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:**\n    The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is formed by the reaction of a calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) with an EDTA anion ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium for the formation is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given as:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Consider the Dissociation:**\n    We are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex will dissociate slightly to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The problem states \"the pH is ideal,\" which implies we can use the given formation constant directly without needing to correct for pH effects (i.e., we assume all free EDTA is in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form).\n\n4.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression:**\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the Equation:**\n    The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This means the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction, and the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n\n    To confirm the calculation, we can use a simple script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# Solve for x from the simplified equation: x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of Ca2+ is x\nca_ion_concentration = x\n\nprint(f\"{ca_ion_concentration:.2e}\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> 6.32e-07\n\nThe calculation shows that $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
