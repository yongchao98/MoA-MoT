    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with the general formula YFₙ.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n*   n is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule (and the oxidation state of Y).\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196. We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (19.00 * n) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * n)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe need to find an integer 'n' that results in the molar mass of a real element (Y) known to form at least five binary fluorides. We can test plausible values for 'n'.\n\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Ca, K - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Br, Se - incorrect chemistry for 5 fluorides)\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Sb - only 2 fluorides)\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (closest is Dy - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest is Hg, Tl - incorrect chemistry)\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest is Pu, Am - plausible)\n\nLet's test Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol). If n=6, our estimate for M(Y) is 242.7 g/mol, which is very close to 244 g/mol.\nLet's calculate the precise ɷF for PuF₆:\nɷF(PuF₆) = (6 * 19.00) / (244 + 6 * 19.00) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%.\nThis value is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy is acceptable in such problems.\n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that **Element Y is Plutonium (Pu)** and **A2 is PuF₆**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Five Plutonium Fluorides (A1 to A5)**\n\nThe problem states there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Plutonium). Let's use the provided clues to identify them.\n\n*   **A2 = PuF₆**: As determined above. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid.\n*   **A1**: \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (PuF₆) and fluorine.\" This means A1 is a higher fluoride of plutonium that is thermally unstable. This points to **A1 = PuF₈**. While extremely unstable and not a common compound, its existence as a transient species that decomposes to PuF₆ and F₂ fits the description perfectly. The \"bright-red\" color is also plausible for a high-oxidation-state compound.\n*   **A3**: \"A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\" and \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\" The direct fluorination of plutonium metal (Y) typically yields **A3 = PuF₄**. PuF₄ is a strong enough fluorinating agent to react with xenon under certain conditions (e.g., to form XeF₂).\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a comproportionation reaction where plutonium metal reduces a higher-oxidation-state plutonium fluoride. A common reaction in plutonium chemistry is the reduction of Pu(IV) by Pu(0) to form Pu(III).\n    *   Let's assume A4 is a Pu(IV) compound. The most common water-soluble Pu(IV) species is formed from PuF₄, but the solution itself would be colored. The problem states the solution of A4 is \"colorless\". This is a key hint. While most actinide ions are colored, the perplutonyl ion, [PuO₂]²⁺, where Pu is in the +6 oxidation state, is known to form nearly colorless solutions in some acids. This ion can be formed by dissolving PuF₆ (A2) in water with an oxidizing agent, or perhaps another fluoride exists that forms this ion. Let's assume A4 is a compound that provides Pu(VI) in solution. The simplest binary fluoride that could do this is PuF₆ itself. However, the problem distinguishes between A2 and A4. A more likely candidate for A4 is **plutonyl fluoride, PuO₂F₂**. This is not a *binary* compound of Y and F, which contradicts the initial statement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Perhaps the \"five binary compounds\" are the known PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆, and the unstable PuF₈.\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nPu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 is PuF₄, then Pu + PuF₄ -> 2PuF₂ (not a known stable fluoride) or Pu + 3PuF₄ -> 4PuF₃. The ratio is not 1:1.\nIf A4 is PuF₆, then 2Pu + PuF₆ -> 3PuF₂ (not stable) or Pu + 2PuF₆ -> 3PuF₄. The ratio is not 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a slight inconsistency in the problem statement, possibly regarding the \"binary\" nature of all compounds or the reaction stoichiometry. However, let's focus on the most chemically sound interpretation. The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` is a comproportionation. A very common one is:\nPu(IV) + Pu(0) -> Pu(III)\n3PuF₄ + Pu -> 4PuF₃ (ratio is 3:1, not 1:1)\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility that the problem refers to a different element. However, the mass calculation for Pu is extremely compelling. Let's stick with Pu and assume there might be a slight inaccuracy in the problem's description of the reaction.\n\nThe most plausible set of well-known fluorides are PuF₃, PuF₄, and PuF₆.\n*   A2 = PuF₆\n*   A1 = PuF₈ (hypothetical but fits decomposition)\n*   A3 = PuF₄ (product of direct fluorination)\n\nThis leaves A4 and A5 to be assigned from the remaining fluorides, likely involving PuF₃.\nThe reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1) in solution is the main puzzle. If we assume the species in solution are ions, the reaction could be:\n2Pu³⁺ + Pu⁰ -> 3Pu²⁺ (Pu(II) is not stable in solution)\nPu⁴⁺ + Pu⁰ -> 2Pu²⁺ (not stable)\n\nLet's ignore the problematic 1:1 ratio for a moment and focus on what A4 could be. It's a fluoride of Y=Pu, and it's used in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". Given that A1, A2, and A3 are already assigned to PuF₈, PuF₆, and PuF₄, the most likely candidate for A4 is **PuF₄**. While Pu(IV) solutions are typically colored, conditions might exist (complexation, high concentration in specific acids) where it's described as \"colorless\", or this could be an idealization in the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nAssuming the most plausible identification based on the available information:\n*   Element Y = Plutonium (Pu)\n*   Compound A4 = Plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF₄)\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of PuF₄.\n*   Molar mass of Pu ≈ 244 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of F ≈ 19 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of PuF₄ = M(Pu) + 4 * M(F)\nMW(PuF₄) = 244 + 4 * 19\nMW(PuF₄) = 244 + 76\nMW(PuF₄) = 320 g/mol\n\nThis calculated molecular weight does not fall into any of the provided ranges. Let's re-read the problem carefully.\n\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"\n\nLet's reconsider the element. What if the element is Uranium (U, M=238)?\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n238 ≈ 40.45 * n => n = 5.88 ≈ 6.\nLet's check ɷF for UF₆:\nɷF(UF₆) = (6 * 19) / (238 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 352 ≈ 0.3239 or 32.39%.\nThis is also close to 31.96%. Uranium is famous for its fluorides (UF₃, UF₄, UF₅, UF₆).\nLet's assume Y = U.\n*   A2 = UF₆ (ɷF = 32.4%)\n*   A1 = A higher fluoride that decomposes to UF₆. (e.g., an unstable adduct)\n*   A3 = UF₆ (product of direct fluorination of U is UF₆)\n*   A4/A5 reaction: U + A4 -> A5.\n    A known reaction is U + 3UF₄ -> 4UF₃. (Not 1:1)\n    Another is U + UF₆ -> intermediate fluorides like UF₅.\n\nLet's calculate the MW of possible uranium fluorides:\n*   UF₃: 238 + 3*19 = 295\n*   UF₄: 238 + 4*19 = 314\n*   UF₅: 238 + 5*19 = 333\n*   UF₆: 238 + 6*19 = 352\n\nNone of these fit the ranges well. The initial mass calculation pointed more strongly to Pu. Let's go back to Pu and reconsider the compounds.\n\nWhat if A4 is not a simple binary fluoride? The problem says \"five binary compounds... are known\", but A4 might be something else used in the synthesis of A5. However, the question asks for the molecular weight of A4, implying it's a specific substance.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass calculation.\nM(Y) = 40.445 * n.\nLet's check n=4. M(Y) = 40.445 * 4 = 161.78. This is very close to Dysprosium (Dy, M=162.5).\nLet's check ɷF for DyF₄:\nɷF(DyF₄) = (4 * 19) / (162.5 + 76) = 76 / 238.5 = 0.3186. This is an excellent match to 31.96%.\nHowever, Dy is a lanthanide and its stable oxidation state is +3. DyF₄ is extremely unstable and not a common reagent. It is unlikely to be involved in this complex set of reactions.\n\nLet's try n=3. M(Y) = 40.445 * 3 = 121.335. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76).\nLet's check ɷF for SbF₃:\nɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 57) = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188. This is also an excellent match.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y = Sb.\n*   Five binary fluorides? No, only SbF₃ and SbF₅ are common. This contradicts the premise.\n\nThe most plausible candidate remains Pu, despite the inconsistencies. Let's assume there is an error in the question's details (like the 1:1 ratio or the \"colorless\" solution) and proceed with the most likely identities.\nY = Pu.\nA2 = PuF₆.\nA4 = PuF₄. MW = 320 g/mol. This is not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from the answers.\nA) 110-130: e.g., KrF₂ (122), Xe (131)\nB) 140-160: e.g., BrF₅ (175), IF₃ (184) - no, IF (146), TeF₄ (204)\nC) 160-180: e.g., SbF₃ (179), BrF₅ (175)\nD) 220-240: e.g., DyF₄ (238.5), AtF₃ (267)\n\nIf A4 is SbF₃, MW = 179, which is in range C. But Sb does not have 5 fluorides.\nIf A4 is BrF₅, MW = 175, which is in range C. Let's test Y=Br.\nA2 has ɷF = 31.96%. Let's check Br fluorides.\nBrF: ɷF = 19 / 98.9 = 19.2%\nBrF₃: ɷF = 57 / 136.9 = 41.6%\nThe mass fraction doesn't match.\n\nThere must be a specific element and set of compounds intended by the problem setter. Let's reconsider the mass calculation as the most solid piece of evidence.\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nThe best fits were Pu (n=6), Dy (n=4), Sb (n=3).\nOf these, only Pu has a rich fluoride chemistry approaching 5 compounds. The inconsistencies in the text (1:1 ratio, color) are likely red herrings or errors. The core identification must come from the mass fraction.\n\nLet's assume Y=Pu. The known fluorides are PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆. Let's call the unstable one PuF₈.\nA1=PuF₈, A2=PuF₆, A3=PuF₄.\nThis leaves A4 and A5 to be PuF₃ and PuF₅.\nReaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4=PuF₅, Pu + PuF₅ -> ? No simple product.\nIf A4=PuF₃, this reaction doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. This is a reduction of A4. So A4 must have a higher oxidation state than A5.\nLet's assume A4 = PuF₄ (Pu⁴⁺) and A5 = PuF₃ (Pu³⁺).\nThe reaction is 3PuF₄ + Pu -> 4PuF₃. The problem states a 1:1 ratio, which is a mismatch. But if we ignore the stoichiometry and accept the identities, then A4 = PuF₄. MW(PuF₄) = 320. Still not in the options.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial calculation. What if the element is Krypton?\nY = Kr, M=83.8.\nA2 = KrF₂. ɷF = (2*19)/(83.8+38) = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y = Kr.\n*   Five binary compounds? No, only KrF₂ is well-established. KrF₄ is disputed. This premise fails.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This would make A1 = KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and can decompose to KrF₂ + F₂.\n*   A1 (KrF₄) oxidizes Xenon. Yes, KrF₄ would be a powerful oxidizer.\n*   A3 (also a Kr fluoride) interacts with Xenon.\n*   A4? A5? Reaction Kr + A4 -> A5? This chemistry is not established.\n\nThis path seems unlikely due to the \"five compounds\" rule. The problem seems to be constructed around a specific, perhaps obscure, chemical system, or it contains significant errors.\n\nLet's revisit the SbF₃ possibility. MW=179, fits range C.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF₃. ɷF=31.88% (excellent fit).\nLet's try to make the rest of the story work, ignoring the \"five fluorides\" rule.\n*   A2 = SbF₃.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. This means A1 = SbF₅. SbF₅ is a liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\" and it doesn't decompose to SbF₃ + F₂ at 293K. It's quite stable. This path fails.\n\nLet's reconsider the molecular weight of A4. The options are 110-130, 140-160, 160-180, 220-240.\nIf the answer is C (160-180), then A4 could be SbF₃ (179) or BrF₅ (175). We've shown that the chemistry for Y=Sb and Y=Br doesn't fit the description of A1/A2.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the mass fraction for A2.\nIf Y=Br, and A4=BrF₅ (MW=175, range C), what could A2 be?\nA2 = BrF₃? ɷF=41.6%. Too far from 31.96%.\nA2 = BrF? ɷF=19.2%. Too far.\n\nThis problem is highly ambiguous or contains errors. However, a choice must be made. The calculation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n is the most quantitative clue. The fits for Sb (n=3) and Dy (n=4) are mathematically excellent.\n*   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF₃. Then A4 could be SbF₅. MW(SbF₅) = 121.76 + 5*19 = 216.76. This is not in the ranges.\n*   If Y=Dy, A2=DyF₄. Then A4 could be DyF₃. MW(DyF₃) = 162.5 + 3*19 = 219.5. This is close to range D.\n\nLet's re-examine the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio).\nDy + A4 -> A5. If A4 is a higher fluoride, this is a reduction. But Dy's most stable state is +3. A reduction of Dy(IV) to Dy(III) is plausible.\nLet A4 = DyF₄. Let A5 = DyF₃.\nReaction: Dy + 3DyF₄ -> 4DyF₃. The ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.\n\nGiven the severe inconsistencies, let's reconsider the most famous series of fluorides: Iodine.\nY=I. M=126.9.\nM(Y) = 40.45 * n => 126.9 = 40.45 * n => n=3.13.\nA2 could be IF₃. ɷF(IF₃) = (3*19)/(126.9+57) = 57/183.9 = 31.0%. This is a decent fit.\nLet's check the chemistry for Y=I.\n*   Five binary compounds? Yes: IF, IF₃, IF₅, IF₇ are known.\n*   A2 = IF₃.\n*   A1 decomposes to A2 (IF₃) and F₂. So A1 = IF₅. IF₅ is a colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\". It doesn't decompose this way at 293K. This path fails.\n\nLet's go back to the best numerical fit that isn't a lanthanide: Antimony (Sb).\nY=Sb, A2=SbF₃, ɷF=31.88%.\nLet's assume the problem creator took liberties with the chemical properties.\nA2 = SbF₃.\nA1 = SbF₅. (Let's ignore that it's stable and not red).\nA3 = SbF₅ (product of fluorination of Sb).\nReaction: Sb + A4 -> A5.\nA4 must be SbF₅. A5 must be SbF₃.\nReaction: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃. The ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF₅, its MW is 216.8 g/mol. Not in the options.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF₃, its MW is 178.8 g/mol. This is in range C (160-180).\nBut if A4=SbF₃, the reaction Sb + SbF₃ -> A5 makes no sense.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5. It's in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This could mean the solvent is part of the reaction. For example, in HF.\nSbF₅ in HF is a superacid, H₂F⁺[SbF₆]⁻.\nLet's assume the system is Antimony. A4 has a MW in one of the ranges. The only plausible candidate is SbF₃ with MW=179. Let's select this and acknowledge the inconsistencies. If A4 is SbF₃, its molecular weight is ~179 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Identify Y and A2: The calculation M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n points strongly to Sb (n=3) or Dy (n=4).\n2.  Test Y=Sb: A2=SbF₃. ɷF is a near-perfect match.\n3.  Identify A4: The other stable fluoride is SbF₅. MW=217. Not in options. The only Sb fluoride whose MW is in an option range is SbF₃ (MW=179, range C).\n4.  Conclusion: Despite the narrative part of the problem being inconsistent with the chemistry of antimony (number of fluorides, properties of A1, reaction stoichiometry), the numerical data (mass fraction) points strongly to A2=SbF₃. If we are forced to choose one of the fluorides of Sb as A4, and its MW must fit an option, the only possibility is A4=SbF₃. This creates a contradiction where A2=A4, but it's the only path that aligns the numerical data with the multiple-choice options.\n\nTherefore, based on the molecular weight calculation, A4 is likely SbF₃.\nMW(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.75 g/mol.\nThis value falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>"
