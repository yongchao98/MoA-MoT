    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\nIn this problem, the number density `n` of the residual gas molecules is constant for both scenarios since the pressure, temperature, and volume of the sample compartment do not change. Therefore, the comparison between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the difference in their respective effective collision cross-sections.\n\n### **2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This involves a gas molecule moving through a gas of other identical molecules.\n*   **Particles:** Both the \"projectile\" and the \"target\" are gas molecules, and both are in thermal motion.\n*   **Formula:** When considering collisions between identical moving particles, kinetic theory introduces a factor of √2 to account for the relative motion. The formula for the mean free path is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where `σ_gg` is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules. If we model them as hard spheres with diameter `d`, then σ_gg = πd².\n\n### **3. Analyzing λ2: Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This involves a high-energy electron from the microscope's beam traveling through the residual gas.\n*   **Particles:** The \"projectile\" is an electron, and the \"target\" is a gas molecule.\n*   **Formula:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light). Compared to these ultra-fast electrons, the gas molecules, with their slow thermal motion, are effectively stationary. For a light, fast particle moving through heavy, stationary targets, the √2 factor is not used. The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### **4. Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis.\n\n*   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gg):** This is determined by the interaction of the electron clouds of two colliding molecules. It's a measure of their effective size in a kinetic sense. For a typical gas molecule like N₂, the kinetic diameter is around 3.7 Å (3.7 x 10⁻¹⁰ m), leading to a cross-section `σ_gg` on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n\n*   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_eg):** This describes the interaction of a 1000 keV (1 MeV) electron with a gas molecule. A high-energy electron is a point-like particle that interacts via the electromagnetic force. To be significantly deflected (i.e., to \"collide\" in a way that affects the microscope image), it must pass very close to the atomic nucleus or an atomic electron. The probability of such a close encounter is very low. The gas atom is mostly \"empty space\" to a fast-moving electron. Consequently, the scattering cross-section `σ_eg` for high-energy electrons is very small, typically many orders of magnitude smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`. For a 1 MeV electron on a light atom, `σ_eg` is on the order of 10⁻²³ m² or even smaller.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude:\n**σ_gg >> σ_eg**\n\n### **5. Final Comparison of λ1 and λ2**\n\nLet's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\nSince √2 ≈ 1.414 and the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a very large number (e.g., 10⁻¹⁹ / 10⁻²³ ≈ 10⁴), the ratio λ2 / λ1 is a very large number, much greater than 1.\n\nλ2 / λ1 >> 1\n\nThis means the mean free path of an electron in the gas (λ2) is vastly larger than the mean free path of a gas molecule in the same gas (λ1).\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nWe have established that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1 (λ2 >> λ1). Now let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct**. Since λ2 is much larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 times λ1.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. The ratio λ2/λ1 is much larger than 1.22.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n\nThe electron's long mean free path is precisely why transmission electron microscopy is possible, even in an imperfect vacuum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
