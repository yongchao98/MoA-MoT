    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When conjugated with a C=C double bond or as part of a carboxylic acid, the peak is often observed around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid. The fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45). This provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   The combined data from FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicate that the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid**, meaning it contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   **Requirement 1: Presence of a Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2).\n    *   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   The carboxylic acid's C=O bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   The alkene's C=C bond accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n        *   Therefore, the target molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    I will use a Python script to calculate the DoU for all options and verify which one meets the requirements.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a given chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    C = int(re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula).group(1))\n    H = int(re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula).group(1))\n    # DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (ignoring halogens and nitrogen)\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\ndef get_oxygen_count(formula):\n    \"\"\"Gets the number of oxygen atoms from a formula string.\"\"\"\n    match = re.search(r'O(\\d*)', formula)\n    if not match:\n        return 0\n    count_str = match.group(1)\n    return int(count_str) if count_str else 1\n\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H10O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Analyzing options based on spectroscopic evidence (requires 2 Oxygens and DoU=2):\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    oxygens = get_oxygen_count(formula)\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}):\")\n    print(f\"  - Oxygen atoms: {oxygens}\")\n    print(f\"  - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): {dou}\")\n    if oxygens == 2 and dou == 2:\n        print(\"  - Verdict: This formula matches all spectroscopic evidence.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"  - Verdict: This formula does not match the evidence.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n```\n<execute_output>\nAnalyzing options based on spectroscopic evidence (requires 2 Oxygens and DoU=2):\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOption A (C6H12O):\n  - Oxygen atoms: 1\n  - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): 1\n  - Verdict: This formula does not match the evidence.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOption B (C6H10O):\n  - Oxygen atoms: 1\n  - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): 2\n  - Verdict: This formula does not match the evidence.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOption C (C6H12O2):\n  - Oxygen atoms: 2\n  - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): 1\n  - Verdict: This formula does not match the evidence.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOption D (C6H10O2):\n  - Oxygen atoms: 2\n  - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): 2\n  - Verdict: This formula matches all spectroscopic evidence.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n</execute_output>\nThe analysis confirms the manual reasoning:\n\n*   **C6H12O2 (Option C):** Has 2 oxygens, but its DoU is 1. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which lacks the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n*   **C6H10O2 (Option D):** Has 2 oxygens and a DoU of 2. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing one C=O bond and one C=C bond, such as a hexenoic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
