    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n        *   The dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid forms a cyclic anhydride.\n        *   The ¹H NMR shows a single peak, meaning all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   The ¹³C NMR shows two peaks, meaning there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent alkene protons (¹H shift ~7 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons: two alkene carbons (¹³C shift ~137 ppm) and two carbonyl carbons (¹³C shift ~165 ppm).\n        *   Structure of maleic anhydride: A five-membered ring with O, C=O, C(H)=C(H), C=O.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n        *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4). The fifth carbon (C5) is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction of a cyclic diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) results in a bicyclic product with a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** core.\n    *   The product's molecular formula is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this:\n        *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). The formula is correct.\n    *   The product structure is **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride**.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n        *   The **endo rule** states that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, formed through a transition state with favorable secondary orbital interactions. The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n        *   **Major Product = Endo isomer.**\n        *   **Minor Product = Exo isomer.**\n\n3.  **Analyze the 3D Structures of the Endo and Exo Isomers**\n    *   In the bicyclo[2.2.1] system, substituents on the C5/C6 bridge can be *endo* (pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond) or *exo* (pointing away from the C2=C3 double bond, towards the C7 bridge).\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring itself is in the *endo* position (tucked under the C2=C3 double bond). This means the two protons on C5 and C6 (originating from maleic anhydride) are in the *exo* position. In this orientation, they point towards the C7 bridge. The C7 bridge has two protons, one *syn* to the double bond and one *anti*. The *exo* protons at C5/C6 are spatially close to the *anti* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is in the *exo* position. This means the protons on C5 and C6 are in the *endo* position, pointing towards the C2=C3 double bond. In this orientation, they are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states there is a cross-peak in the major product's spectrum that is absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our structural analysis, the close proximity between the **protons at C5/C6** and the ***anti* proton at C7** is a unique feature of the major (*endo*) isomer. This interaction is absent in the minor (*exo*) isomer.\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak must connect the signals for these specific protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n    *   Let's assign the proton signals described in the options to the protons in the molecule:\n        *   **Protons at C5/C6 (from anhydride):** These two equivalent protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups in a strained ring. Their chemical shift will be significantly downfield. The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** is the correct assignment.\n        *   **Protons at C7 (bridge):** These are two diastereotopic protons on a methylene bridge. They would typically appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to geminal coupling. A chemical shift around 1-2 ppm is expected. The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups. The vinylic methyls (at C2/C3) are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls (at C1/C4).\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the two vinylic methyl groups.\n            *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm** corresponds to the two bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The unique NOESY cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the protons at C5/C6 with one of the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the resonance at **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)** and the resonance at **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). These are far apart in the endo isomer.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton). These are not uniquely close in the endo isomer.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls). An NOE might exist, but it would likely be present in both isomers, not a distinguishing feature.\nD) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons). This corresponds to the unique spatial proximity in the major (endo) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
