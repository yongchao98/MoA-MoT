    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final volume of the solution (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2).\n*   M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains.\n*   The solution at this point is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   The ratio of the concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   First, calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n*   First, we need to find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (V_eq).\n    Moles of acid = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 M * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n    At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid.\n    V_eq = moles_base / M_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   Next, calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point.\n    Total Volume = V_acid + V_eq = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point.\n    [A⁻] = moles of acetate / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C.\n    Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻].\n    Let x = [OH⁻]. Then [HA] = x and [A⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    Kb = x² / (0.02 - x).\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    Kb ≈ x² / 0.02  =>  x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * 0.02).\n*   Finally, calculate pOH and then pH.\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\nTo get the precise numerical values, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3\n# Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the equivalence point ---\n\n# Concentration of acetic acid after dilution\nconc_acid = 0.025  # M\n# Volume of diluted acid\nvol_acid = 0.040  # L\n# Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = conc_acid * vol_acid\n\n# Concentration of NaOH\nconc_base = 0.1  # M\n# Volume of NaOH at equivalence point\nvol_base_eq = moles_acid / conc_base\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = vol_acid + vol_base_eq\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of acetate\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate]  (using approximation)\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nComparing the calculated values with the given options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State (Dilution)**\n\n*   First, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH, a weak acid, which we'll denote as HA) after it has been diluted.\n*   The initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁) is 0.05 M.\n*   The initial volume of acetic acid (V₁) is 20.00 cm³.\n*   It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The final volume (V₂) is the sum of the initial volume and the added water volume: V₂ = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution that we will titrate is **0.025 M**.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O (or HA + OH⁻ → A⁻ + H₂O).\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   At this point, the solution contains a significant amount of both the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⁻), forming a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation** to find the pH of a buffer:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid, [A⁻]/[HA], is equal to the ratio of their moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, we can calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (HA) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the product, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO), and water.\n*   Sodium acetate is a salt that dissociates into Na⁺ (a spectator ion) and CH₃COO⁻ (A⁻, the conjugate base of acetic acid).\n*   The acetate ion (A⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n    *   A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   To find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   **Step 3a: Find the concentration of acetate [A⁻] at the equivalence point.**\n        *   Moles of acid initially present = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n        *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n        *   Volume of NaOH added (V_eq) = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n        *   Total volume at equivalence point = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n        *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles of acetate / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n    *   **Step 3b: Calculate [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\n        *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it from Ka using the relation Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n        *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n        *   For the hydrolysis equilibrium A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻, the expression for Kb is: Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻].\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [HA]. Then [A⁻] = 0.02 - x. We can approximate [A⁻] ≈ 0.02 M since Kb is small.\n        *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02  =>  x = [OH⁻] = √(Kb * 0.02).\n    *   **Step 3c: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n        *   pOH = -log([OH⁻])\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\n**4.
