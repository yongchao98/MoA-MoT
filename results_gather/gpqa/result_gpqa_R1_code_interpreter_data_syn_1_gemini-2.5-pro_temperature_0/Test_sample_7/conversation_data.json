  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the single-gene knock-out mutants.**\n    *   The wild-type (WT) plant has 100% resistance, which serves as our control.\n    *   The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance. This means gene G1 contributes to the resistance, and its loss causes a 25% reduction in resistance.\n    *   The `g2` mutant has 0% resistance. This means gene G2 is absolutely essential for the resistance phenotype. Its loss completely abolishes resistance.\n    *   The `g3` mutant has 50% resistance. This means gene G3 is also important for resistance, and its loss causes a 50% reduction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the phenotypes of the double-gene knock-out mutants to determine gene interactions (epistasis).**\n    *   Epistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. The gene whose phenotype is expressed in the double mutant is said to be epistatic to the other gene.\n    *   **`g1g2` mutant:** Has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   **`g2g3` mutant:** Has 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g3` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n\n3.  **Interpret the epistasis results for G2.**\n    *   Since the `g2` knockout phenotype (complete loss of resistance) masks the phenotypes of both `g1` and `g3`, it indicates that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3 in the genetic pathway, or is a critical component in the main pathway that G1 and G3 contribute to.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF). A TF is a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. Given that G2 is essential and epistatic to the other two genes, **G2 is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor** that activates the expression of G1, G3, and possibly other genes required for resistance.\n\n4.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3.**\n    *   **`g1g3` mutant:** Has 10% resistance.\n    *   Let's compare this to the single mutants: `g1` has 75% resistance, and `g3` has 50% resistance.\n    *   The double mutant's phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as either single mutant's phenotype, so there is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3.\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant is much more severe than a simple additive effect of the two mutations. The loss of resistance in `g1` is 25%, and in `g3` is 50%. An additive loss would be 75%, resulting in 25% resistance. The actual resistance is only 10% (a 90% loss).\n    *   This much stronger effect in the double mutant is called a **synergistic interaction**. This typically occurs when two genes have partially overlapping or redundant functions. They might act in two parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome (resistance). When one gene is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the function almost completely fails. Therefore, **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options based on the conclusions.**\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is likely the transcription factor. This supports options A, B, and C. It contradicts option D.\n    *   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. This supports option B. It contradicts the term \"pleiotropy\" in options C and D. \"Same promoter\" in option A is a possible mechanism but \"gene redundancy\" is a better description of the observed interaction.\n    *   **Conclusion 3:** There is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3. However, options A, B, and C all make a claim about epistasis between G1 and G3. Let's check them:\n        *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" (Option A) is false because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" (Options B and C) is false because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n    *   **Synthesize and select the best option:** Option B states that \"G2 is a transcription factor\" (correct) and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" (correct). Although its third statement, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is incorrect based on the data, Option B contains the most accurate descriptions of the genetic relationships derived from the experiment. The other options contain more significant errors (e.g., identifying the wrong TF, using the wrong term for the gene interaction). Therefore, Option B is the best possible answer, assuming a likely error in the construction of the question's third clause.\n\n<<<B>>>"
