    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond (C=C).\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C)**:\n    *   6 carbons in the ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 carbon in the -CHO group.\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2) -> 7 H\n    *   In the -COOH group: 1 H\n    *   In the -CHO group: 1 H\n    *   In the vinyl group (-CH=CH2): 3 H\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**:\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Calculate the IHD of the Reactant**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **From the structure**: IHD = (number of rings) + (number of π-bonds)\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (cyclohexene ring)\n    *   Number of π-bonds:\n        *   1 from the C=C in the ring.\n        *   1 from the C=C in the vinyl group.\n        *   1 from the C=O in the carboxylic acid group.\n        *   1 from the C=O in the formyl group.\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n*   **From the molecular formula (C10H12O3)**: IHD = C + 1 - H/2\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = **5**.\nBoth methods give the same IHD for the reactant.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the reactant is as follows:\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all multiple bonds, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon, while keeping the carbon skeleton (including rings) intact.\n\n**4. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of the reaction to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n*   The **-COOH** group at C1 is reduced to a **-CH3** group.\n*   The **-CHO** group at C2 is reduced to a **-CH3** group.\n*   The **-CH=CH2** (vinyl) group at C5 is reduced to a **-CH2CH3** (ethyl) group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon count remains 10 (C10). All double bonds and oxygen atoms are gone. The resulting molecule is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**5. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nWe can now calculate the IHD for the product (C10H20).\n\n*   **Method 1: Tracking the change in IHD**\n    *   Initial IHD = 5.\n    *   The reaction reduces four π-bonds (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in the vinyl group, one C=O in the formyl group, and one C=O in the carboxyl group). Each reduction of a π-bond decreases the IHD by 1.\n    *   The ring structure is preserved.\n    *   Final IHD = Initial IHD - (number of π-bonds reduced) = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the product's structure**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   IHD = (number of rings) + (number of π-bonds)\n    *   Number of rings = 1.\n    *   Number of π-bonds = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated).\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 3: Using the product's molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    We can use a python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n# The general formula for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is:\n# IHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n# where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogen, X is halogens, and N is nitrogen.\n\nC = 10\nH = 20\nX = 0\nN = 0\n\nIHD = C - (H / 2) - (X / 2) + (N / 2) + 1\n\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\n<execute_code>\n1\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the IHD of the product C10H20 is 1. This value corresponds to the single ring present in the final saturated molecule.\n\nFinal Answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>",

The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula. For a hydrocarbon CxHy, the formula is:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\n\nLet's use a python script to perform this calculation for the product, C10H20.\n\n```python\n# Molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n# The general formula for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is:\n# IHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n# where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogen, X is halogens, and N is nitrogen.\n# For a hydrocarbon, the formula simplifies to IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n\nC = 10\nH = 20\nX = 0\nN = 0\n\nIHD = C - (H / 2) - (X / 2) + (N / 2) + 1\n\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\nThe code calculates the IHD for the final product based on its molecular formula, C10H20. The calculation is IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThis result makes sense structurally. The reaction removes all pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) but preserves the single ring of the cyclohexane structure. The IHD of a molecule is the sum of its rings and pi bonds. Since the product has 1 ring and 0 pi bonds, its IHD is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Analyze the Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   **Parent structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Functional Groups**:\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group, which by convention is at position C1.\n    *   A `formyl` (-CHO) group at position C2.\n    *   A `vinyl` (-CH=CH2) group at position C5.\n\nBased on this structure, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in -CH=CH2 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\nIHD = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) = **5**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to alkanes (-CH3).\n*   Reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Removes all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all functional groups and points of unsaturation but will keep the carbon skeleton intact.\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane.

Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the product can be calculated from its molecular formula (C10H20) or its structure.\n\n*   **From the structure**: The product has one ring and zero π-bonds. So, IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n*   **From the formula**: The IHD for a hydrocarbon CxHy is calculated as IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n\nLet's use a python script to confirm the calculation from the molecular formula.\n\n```python\n# The molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n# The formula for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for a molecule with formula CxHyNzOwXx is:\n# IHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n# For the product C10H20, we have C=10, H=20, and other atoms are 0.\n\nC = 10\nH = 20\n\n# The formula simplifies for a hydrocarbon\nIHD = C - (H / 2) + 1\n\nprint(int(IHD))\n```\nThe code calculates the IHD for the product C10H20. The calculation is IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1. This value corresponds to the single ring in the cyclohexane structure, as all pi bonds have been saturated by the reduction reaction.
