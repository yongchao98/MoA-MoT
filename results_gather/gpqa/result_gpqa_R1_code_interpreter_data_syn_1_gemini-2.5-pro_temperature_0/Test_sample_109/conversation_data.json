    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **1. Define Observability Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be observable by both instruments, it must meet two criteria:\n1.  **Positional Criterion (Visibility):** The star must rise above the horizon at both observatory locations.\n2.  **Brightness Criterion (Magnitude):** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limit of *both* instruments.\n\n#### **Positional Criterion**\n*   The W. M. Keck Observatory (home to HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude (φ) of approximately +20° N. A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is greater than φ - 90°, so **DEC > -70°**.\n*   The Paranal Observatory (home to ESPRESSO) is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude (φ) of approximately -24° S. A star is visible if its declination (DEC) is less than φ + 90°, so **DEC < +66°**.\n*   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both sites, its declination must be in the range **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n#### **Brightness Criterion**\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17, so **V < 17**.\n*   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 16, so **V < 16**.\n*   To be observed by both, the star must satisfy the stricter limit: **V < 16**.\n\n### **2. Calculate Apparent Magnitude**\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we use the distance modulus formula, including extinction:\n`V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10) + A_V`\nwhere:\n*   `V` is the apparent V magnitude.\n*   `M_V` is the absolute V magnitude.\n*   `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   `A_V` is the total absorption (extinction) in the V band. `A_V` is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n### **3. Analyze Each Star**\n\nLet's evaluate each star against these criteria.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define observability criteria\nKECK_LAT = 19.8  # Keck Observatory latitude\nPARANAL_LAT = -24.6 # Paranal Observatory latitude\nMAG_LIMIT = 16.0 # Stricter magnitude limit (HIRES)\n\ndef check_star(name, dec, V=None, M_V=None, d_pc=None, E_BV=0.0):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a star is observable by both instruments.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing {name} ---\")\n    \n    # 1. Check Visibility\n    visible_keck = dec > (KECK_LAT - 90)\n    visible_paranal = dec < (PARANAL_LAT + 90)\n    \n    if not (visible_keck and visible_paranal):\n        print(f\"Result: NOT OBSERVABLE. Fails visibility check (DEC = {dec}°).\")\n        return False\n    \n    print(\"Visibility: OK\")\n\n    # 2. Check Magnitude\n    # Calculate apparent magnitude V if not provided\n    if V is None:\n        A_V = 3.1 * E_BV\n        V = M_V + 5 * math.log10(d_pc / 10) + A_V\n        print(f\"Calculated Apparent Magnitude V = {V:.2f}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Given Apparent Magnitude V = {V:.2f}\")\n\n    if V < MAG_LIMIT:\n        print(f\"Magnitude: OK (V = {V:.2f} is brighter than {MAG_LIMIT})\")\n        print(f\"Result: OBSERVABLE by both.\")\n        return True\n    else:\n        print(f\"Result: NOT OBSERVABLE. Fails magnitude check (V = {V:.2f} is not brighter than {MAG_LIMIT}).\")\n        return False\n\n# --- Star Data & Analysis ---\ncheck_star(\"Star1\", dec=-75, M_V=15.5, d_pc=10)\ncheck_star(\"Star2\", dec=55, V=16.5)\ncheck_star(\"Star3\", dec=48, V=15.5)\ncheck_star(\"Star4\", dec=-48, M_V=15.5, d_pc=10, E_BV=0.4)\ncheck_star(\"Star5\", dec=60, M_V=16.5, d_pc=5)\n```",
    "Based on the analysis, here is the evaluation of each star:\n\n*   **Star1:** Fails the visibility criterion. Its declination of -75° is too far south to be observed from the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (minimum declination is approximately -70°).\n*   **Star2:** Fails the brightness criterion. Its apparent magnitude of 16.5 mag is fainter than the 16.0 mag limit of the HIRES spectrograph.\n*   **Star3:** **Passes both criteria.** Its declination of +48° is visible from both observatories. Its apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag is brighter than the 16.0 mag limit for HIRES.\n*   **Star4:** Fails the brightness criterion. Its absolute magnitude is 15.5 mag at a distance of 10 pc, but there is also significant extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag`). Its final apparent magnitude is `V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`, which is fainter than the HIRES limit.\n*   **Star5:** **Passes both criteria.** Its declination of +60° is visible from both observatories. Its absolute magnitude is 16.5 mag, but it is close by at 5 pc. Its apparent magnitude is calculated as `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15.0 mag`, which is brighter than the HIRES limit.\n\nTherefore, only Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both instruments.\n\n<<<D>>>"
