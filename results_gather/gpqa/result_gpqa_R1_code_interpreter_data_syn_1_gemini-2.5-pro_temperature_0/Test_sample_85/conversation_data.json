    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\nThe problem involves two separate reactions starting from stereoisomers of the same compound, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, and producing stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two reducing agents and how the stereochemistry is affected.\n\n**Starting Material Structure:**\nThe starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Its structure is:\n```\n      Et\n      |\nHOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu\n  1    2    3    4      5\n```\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-isobutyl). The chiral center is at carbon-3 (C3), marked with an asterisk in some representations.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a lactone (a cyclic ester). Its structure is:\n```\n      O(1)\n     / \\\n  C(2)=O   C(6)H2\n /         \\\nC(3)H2       C(5)H2\n \\         /\n  C(4)H-Et\n```\nThe chiral center in the product is at carbon-4 (C4). This C4 atom corresponds to the C3 atom of the starting material.\n\n**Reagent Selectivity:**\n1.  **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n2.  **BH₃ (Borane):** This is also a selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, but it does **not** typically reduce esters under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group of starting material A to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) LiBH₄-->   HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--CH2OH\n          (A)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy acid)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the carboxylic acid group and the newly formed hydroxyl group to form the six-membered lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the carbonyl centers, which are two carbons away from the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is not altered (no inversion or racemization occurs). However, the R/S designation might change if the chemical transformation alters the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu (higher priority than the acid group because isobutyl > H)\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The groups attached to the chiral C4 are -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the ring fragment -CH₂C(=O)O-, and the ring fragment -CH₂CH₂O-.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in A) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in A) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** Since the groups with priorities 1 and 2 in the starting material have their priorities swapped in the product, the R/S designation will be inverted.\n        *   (S)-A → (R)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-A → (S)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(R)-lactone**. Therefore, the starting material **A must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction Step:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group of starting material B to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n    ```\n          Et\n          |\n    HOOC--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu   --(1) BH₃-->   HOCH2--CH2--CH--CH2--COO-iBu\n          (B)                                     (Intermediate hydroxy ester)\n    ```\n2.  **Lactonization Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone, displacing isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Again, the reaction does not alter the configuration of the chiral center. We must check the CIP priorities.\n\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂COOiBu\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂COOH\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** Same as before.\n        *   Priority 1: -CH₂C(=O)O-\n        *   Priority 2: -CH₂CH₂O-\n        *   Priority 3: -CH₂CH₃ (Et)\n        *   Priority 4: -H\n\n    *   **Mapping Priorities:** In this reaction, the ester group (-CH₂COOiBu, Priority 1 in B) becomes the -CH₂C(=O)O- fragment (Priority 1 in the product). The acid group (-CH₂COOH, Priority 2 in B) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- fragment (Priority 2 in the product).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The group with priority 1 in the starting material becomes the group with priority 1 in the product. The group with priority 2 becomes the group with priority 2. The priority order of the substituents is preserved. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained.\n        *   (S)-B → (S)-Lactone\n        *   (R)-B → (R)-Lactone\n    *   The problem states that the product is the **(S)-lactone**. Therefore, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
