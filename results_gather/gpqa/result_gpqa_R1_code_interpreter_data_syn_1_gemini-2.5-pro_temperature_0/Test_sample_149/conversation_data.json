    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring. The presence of an aldehyde group (C=O) would account for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to an adjacent group with 1 proton (n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the -CH2- protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4- or para-disubstituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5 °C:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **H2O, Heat:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water, which hydrolyzes it. The -N₂⁺ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   This two-step process effectively converts the starting 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal into **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n    *   **aq. KOH:** Potassium hydroxide is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon to form an enolate ion.\n    *   This enolate ion is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This is a self-**aldol addition** reaction.\n    *   The product of the addition is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    *   **Heat:** The reaction is heated. Aldol addition products readily undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) under heat, especially when the resulting product is conjugated. This step is called **aldol condensation**.\n    *   The β-hydroxy aldehyde eliminates water (the -OH from C3 and an acidic H from C2) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The formation of the C=C double bond creates a conjugated system (phenyl-C=C-C=O), which is thermodynamically very stable and drives the reaction to completion.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe reaction sequence leads to an aldol condensation product.\n*   Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n*   Aldol Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D)\n*   Final Condensation Product (due to heat): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option A)\n\nSince the conditions specify \"Heat\", the final isolated product will be the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
