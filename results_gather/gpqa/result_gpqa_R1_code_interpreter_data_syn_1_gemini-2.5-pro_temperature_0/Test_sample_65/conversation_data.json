    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. The construction of SMEFT relies on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All known fundamental theories of particle physics, including the Standard Model and its extensions like SMEFT, are formulated as Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. The operators in SMEFT are constructed to be scalars under Lorentz transformations, meaning they respect this symmetry.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry**: This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational principle upon which quantum field theory is built. SMEFT operators are constructed to be invariant under Poincare transformations.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established that the weak interaction in the Standard Model violates CP symmetry (as observed in the neutral kaon system and B-meson decays, and described by the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the Standard Model, it must also incorporate this known CP violation. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, SMEFT operators are **not** required to respect CP symmetry. In fact, searching for new CP-violating effects is a major goal of the SMEFT program.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The **CPT Theorem** is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are:\n*   Lorentz Symmetry (1)\n*   Poincare Symmetry (2)\n*   CPT Symmetry (4)\n\nCP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry of SMEFT.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
