    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-). Substituents determine the position (ortho, meta, or para) where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack and the rate of the reaction.\n\n*   **Activating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl): Activating\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating\n*   **Deactivating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but have lone pairs that can donate through resonance, directing the electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) -Cl (chloro): Deactivating\n*   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ethyl carboxylate)\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxylic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Separate into low-yield and high-yield groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can separate the substances into two groups:\n*   **Low para-yield group (meta-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a very minor product. The main product is the meta-isomer. This group includes substances 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **High para-yield group (ortho/para-directors):** For these substances, the para-isomer is a major product, along with the ortho-isomer. This group includes substances 1, 3, and 5.\n\nThe final ordered list will have all the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho/para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within the low-yield (meta-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5). For these meta-directors, the amount of para-product formed is inversely proportional to the strength of the deactivating/meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will lead to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and consequently a lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the substances within the high-yield (ortho/para-directing) group**\n\nThe substances are 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl). The yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing 1 (-CH3) and 5 (-C2H5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is their size. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This larger size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position relatively more accessible for the incoming bromine. Therefore, ethylbenzene is expected to give a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with 3 (-Cl):** The chloro group is deactivating but directs ortho/para. For halogens, electronic factors cause a strong preference for substitution at the para position compared to the ortho position. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the ortho position than the para position. This leads to a very high para/ortho ratio. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% of the para-isomer, which is higher than the yield from toluene (about 67%). It is also expected to be higher than the yield from ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, chlorobenzene (3) will have the highest para-isomer yield in this group.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups to get the final order**\n\nWe combine the ordered low-yield group and the ordered high-yield group. The para-yield for any ortho/para-director will be significantly greater than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Low-yield order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   High-yield order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nC6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5 < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived order matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
