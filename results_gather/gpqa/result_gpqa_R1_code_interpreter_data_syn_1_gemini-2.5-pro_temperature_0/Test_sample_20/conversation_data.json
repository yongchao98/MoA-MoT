    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules can interconvert by a chemical reaction, most commonly the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This alpha-carbon is typically sp³ hybridized.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are highly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It converts to its enol form, benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, they are not the typical labile alpha-hydrogens found on sp³ carbons that participate in keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** For benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) to form its corresponding phenol-like structure (hydroquinone, C₆H₆O₂), it would need to gain two hydrogen atoms. This is a change in the molecular formula, which means the reaction is a reduction, not an isomerization (tautomerism).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to it are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of an ester with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (inversion center) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
