    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad peak from `3400–2500 cm-1` is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong absorption at `1720 cm-1` is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically within the range for a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at `1610 cm-1` and `1450 cm-1` suggest the presence of an aromatic ring (C=C stretching).\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicates a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH), while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is likely the -CH₂ group mentioned above. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and another proton.\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the -CH group. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to the -CH₃ at 1.4 ppm and the -CH₂ at 1.7 ppm. It is also in the benzylic position (attached to the ring), which shifts it downfield.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. Connecting them through the -CH₂- and -CH- gives the structure: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   Based on the analysis, Compound X has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a *para* arrangement.\n        *   Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Transformation:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). It also reduces alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to their corresponding alkanes.\n    3.  **Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unreactive under these conditions.\n        *   Final Product: The -COOH at position 1 becomes -CH₃, and the sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged. The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The final product of the reaction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
