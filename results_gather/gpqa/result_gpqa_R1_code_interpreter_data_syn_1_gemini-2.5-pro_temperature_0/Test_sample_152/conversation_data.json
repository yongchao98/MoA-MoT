    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. In the presence of a base (sodium ethoxide, NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `[-]CH(COOCH3)2`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The malonate enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    2.  The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   Donor enolate: `(CH3OOC)2CH-`\n    *   Acceptor: `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`\n    *   The nucleophile `(CH3OOC)2CH-` attacks the β-carbon. A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   The intermediate is `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-C[-]H-COOCH3`.\n    *   Protonation at the α-carbon gives the final product: `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n*   **Product Name (A):** To name this compound, we can consider it a substituted propane with three trimethyl carboxylate groups. The main chain is propane (C1-C2-C3).\n    *   Let's assign the structure to the name `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n    *   At C1, there are two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOCH3`).\n    *   At C2, there is a p-tolyl group.\n    *   At C3, there is one methoxycarbonyl group.\n    *   This gives the structure: `(CH3OOC)2CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH2COOCH3`.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product. Thus, the name for product **A** is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a specific type of Michael addition known as the Stork enamine alkylation.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    3.  The intermediate is then hydrolyzed with aqueous acid (H3O+) to convert the iminium group back into a ketone.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the nitrile (`-CH(CH3)-`).\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part becomes a cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position (the α-position to the carbonyl).\n    *   The substituent is `-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n    *   The structure is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at C2 with a `(1-methyl-2-cyanoethyl)` group.\n*   **Product Name (B):** To name this compound, we can treat the butanenitrile as the parent chain.\n    *   Parent chain: butanenitrile, `N≡C(1)-C(2)H2-C(3)H-C(4)H3`.\n    *   The substituent is on C3. The substituent is a cyclohexanone ring attached at its C2 position, which is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the name for product **B** is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product, not the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a retrosynthesis problem. We are given the product and one reactant, and we need to find the other reactant, **C**.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Given Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH2=CH-CO-CH3`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael addition involves the formation of a new C-C bond between the α-carbon of a donor and the β-carbon of an acceptor.\n    *   The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton and a `3-oxobutyl` side chain (`-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3`).\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` side chain is derived from the Michael acceptor, MVK (`CH2(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH3`).\n    *   This means the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` skeleton must come from the Michael donor, reactant **C**.\n    *   The reaction is catalyzed by base (KOH), which deprotonates the most acidic proton of the donor. In `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, the proton at C2 is highly acidic as it is located between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` attacks the β-carbon of MVK to form the product.\n*   **Reactant C:** Therefore, reactant **C** is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A is wrong, B is wrong, C is wrong.\n*   B) A is wrong, B is wrong, C is correct.\n*   C) A is correct, B is correct, C is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is correct, C is wrong.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
