    "This is a classic conditional probability problem involving exponential decay. Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve it.\n\n### **1. Understanding Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. A key property of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom doesn't \"age\".\n\n### **2. Defining the Mathematical Model**\n\nLet `T` be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function:\n`P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\n\nThe probability that the atom decays by time `t` is:\n`P(T <= t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\nHere, `λ` is the decay constant, which we need to determine first.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(T <= 100) = 0.32`\n\nUsing the formula:\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nWe can solve for `λ` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, but it's often easier to work directly with the `e^(-λt)` term.\n\n### **4. Setting up the Conditional Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nLet's express this in terms of `T`:\n*   The event of surviving the first 50 minutes is `T > 50`.\n*   The event of decaying in the next 150 minutes means decaying between `t=50` and `t=50+150=200`. This is the event `50 < T <= 200`.\n\nWe want to find the conditional probability `P(50 < T <= 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n### **5. Applying the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in the *first* 150 minutes.\n\nSo, `P(50 < T <= 200 | T > 50) = P(T <= 150)`\n\n### **6. Calculating the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `P(T <= 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\nWe know from Step 3 that `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`. We can use this to find `e^(-150λ)`:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow, let's compute the value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, the survival probability for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# So, exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which due to the memoryless property,\n# is the same as the probability of decay for a new atom in 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n# We can write exp(-lambda * 150) as (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# So, P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nprob_decay = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"{prob_decay * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n\nThe calculation shows that the probability is approximately 43.96%.\n\n`1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5604 ≈ 0.4396`\n\nThis is 43.96%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics: Radioactive Decay and the Memoryless Property**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process that follows an exponential distribution. A fundamental characteristic of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an event occurring in a future interval is independent of how much time has already passed. In this context, the atom does not \"age.\" The fact that it has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n\n### **2. Define the Mathematical Model**\n\nLet `T` be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (i.e., it survives past `t`) is given by the survival function:\n`P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`\n\nWhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nConsequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n`P(T ≤ t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n### **3. Use the Given Data to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n\nUsing our formula:\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nWe can solve for `λ` by taking the natural logarithm, but it's often simpler to work with the `e^(-λt)` term directly.\n\n### **4. Formulate the Question**\n\nWe are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\n*   The event of surviving the first 50 minutes is `T > 50`.\n*   The event of decaying in the next 150 minutes means decaying between `t=50` and `t=50+150=200`. This is the event `50 < T ≤ 200`.\n\nWe need to find the conditional probability: `P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50)`.\n\n### **5. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is exactly the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in the *first* 150 minutes.\n\nTherefore:\n`P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\n### **6. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nOur goal is now to calculate `P(T ≤ 150)`.\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-150λ)` using the relationship we found in Step 3 (`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`):\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nSo, the probability of decay is:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nLet's compute this value using a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32.\n# This means P(survival for 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# In the exponential decay model, P(survival for t) = exp(-lambda * t).\n# So, exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68.\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is the same as the probability\n# of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150).\n\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of what we know:\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# So, P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nprob_decay_in_150_min = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n\n# Print the result as a percentage.\nprint(f\"The probability is {prob_decay_in_150_min * 100:.2f}%\")\n\n```\nThe calculation shows the probability is approximately 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the concept of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **The Memoryless Property:** The most crucial concept here is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay just because it has survived for a while. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Question:** Because of the memoryless property, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Mathematical Formulation:**\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom decays within time `t`. The formula for this is `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of survival beyond time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Using the Given Data:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we found in the previous step:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n        `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Computation:**\n    *   Calculating `(0.68)^1.5` gives approximately `0.5607`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n    *   This probability, `0.4393`, is equal to `43.93%`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to the answer choice 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
