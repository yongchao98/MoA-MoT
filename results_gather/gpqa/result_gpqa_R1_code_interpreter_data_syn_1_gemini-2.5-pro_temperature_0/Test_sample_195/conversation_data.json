    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a harmonic oscillator in the framework of special relativity. The key principle to use is the conservation of total energy.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy:** In relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and any potential energy.\n    *   The relativistic energy of the mass $m$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring is given by Hooke's law, $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   The total conserved energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** The total energy of the oscillator remains constant throughout its motion. We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement.** At this point, the displacement is $x = A$ (the amplitude), and the mass momentarily stops, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.** At this point, the displacement is $x = 0$, and the potential energy is zero. All the energy is kinetic, so the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy at Point 1 (x = A):**\n    *   Speed $v = 0$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy is $E_{total, 1} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy at Point 2 (x = 0):**\n    *   Speed is $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy is $E_{total, 2} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Equate the energies and solve for v_max:**\n    Since energy is conserved, $E_{total, 1} = E_{total, 2}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect form.\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Dimensionally inconsistent.\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - Matches the derivation.\n    *   D) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - This is the non-relativistic (classical) limit.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
