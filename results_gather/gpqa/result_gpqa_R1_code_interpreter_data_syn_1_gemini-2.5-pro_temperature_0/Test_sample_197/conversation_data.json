    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species:**\n    In a solution of Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN⁻), a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are the free Co²⁺ ion and the various thiocyanato complexes:\n    *   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n2.  **Write the expression for total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β) to relate the concentrations:**\n    The overall stability constants are given for the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and the ligand:\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n        `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n        => `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)₂]`\n        `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n        => `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n        `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n        => `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ <=> [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n        `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n        => `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻]:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out the `[Co²⁺]` term:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Determine the fraction of the desired complex:**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`. The fraction of this complex (let's call it `α₂`) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, which means the fraction is independent of the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    Now, plug in the given values: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`, `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`.\n\n    First, calculate the denominator (let's call it `D`):\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    *   `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Next, calculate the numerator (the term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n    *   `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\n    Finally, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n    *   `α₂ = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**\n    *   `Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value rounds to 16.9%.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The fraction of a complex [MLn] is given by alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum(beta_i * [L]^i))\n# We want to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2], which corresponds to alpha_2.\n\n# Calculate the numerator for alpha_2\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the denominator (sum of all terms)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Define the species and total concentration:**\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are `Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\nThe total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Express species concentrations using stability constants (β):**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**3. Formulate the fraction of the desired complex (α₂):**\nThe fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as α₂, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for α₂:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, showing that the fraction depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Calculate the numerical value:**\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n*   `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the numerator:\n*   `Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\n*   `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**5. Convert to percentage:**\n*   `Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation, yielding a value of 16.916%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
