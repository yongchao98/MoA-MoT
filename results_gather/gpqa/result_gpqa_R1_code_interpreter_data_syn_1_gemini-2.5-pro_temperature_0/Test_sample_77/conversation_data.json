    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The derivation of these potentials is a standard topic in electromagnetism.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe electric and magnetic fields at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier time, called the retarded time `tr`. This is because electromagnetic disturbances propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the relation:\n`t = tr + d/c`\nwhere `d` is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time, `s(tr)`, to the observation point `r`.\n`d = |r - s(tr)|`\n\nThe potentials `V(r, t)` and `A(r, t)` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `t_ret = t - |r - r'|/c`.\n\nFor a point charge `q` with trajectory `s(t)` and velocity `v(t) = ds/dt`, the charge and current densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Scalar Potential (V)\nSubstituting the charge density into the formula for `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q δ³(r' - s(t - |r - r'|/c)) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nThis integral is non-trivial because the retarded time depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard method to solve this is to change the integration variable or, more formally, to evaluate the integral by first integrating over space and then time.\n\nLet's consider the integral in a slightly different form:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫∫ [ρ(r', t') / |r - r'|] δ(t' - (t - |r - r'|/c)) dt' d³r'`\nSubstitute `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) ∫∫ [δ³(r' - s(t')) / |r - r'|] δ(t' - (t - |r - r'|/c)) dt' d³r'`\n\nFirst, perform the spatial integral over `d³r'`:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) ∫ [1 / |r - s(t')|] δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\n\nThis integral is of the form `∫ f(t') δ(g(t')) dt'`. The result is `f(tr) / |g'(tr)|`, where `tr` is the time at which `g(tr) = 0`.\nHere, `f(t') = 1 / |r - s(t')|` and `g(t') = t' - t + |r - s(t')|/c`.\nThe condition `g(tr) = 0` gives `tr - t + |r - s(tr)|/c = 0`, which is the definition of the retarded time `tr`.\n\nNow we need to compute the derivative `g'(t')`:\n`g'(t') = d/dt' [t' - t + (1/c) |r - s(t')|] = 1 + (1/c) * d/dt'|r - s(t')|`\nLet `d(t') = r - s(t')`. The magnitude is `d(t') = |d(t')|`.\n`d/dt' d(t') = d/dt' sqrt(d(t') ⋅ d(t')) = (1 / (2d(t'))) * 2d(t') ⋅ (d/dt' d(t'))`\n`d/dt' d(t') = d/dt' (r - s(t')) = -s'(t') = -v(t')`\nSo, `d/dt' d(t') = (d(t') ⋅ (-v(t'))) / d(t') = - (d(t') ⋅ v(t')) / d(t')`\n\nEvaluating at `t' = tr`, and using the notation from the problem statement (`d = r - s(tr)`, `d = |d|`, `v = v(tr)`):\n`g'(tr) = 1 + (1/c) * [ - (d ⋅ v) / d ] = 1 - (d ⋅ v) / (cd) = (cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)`\n\nThe term `cd - d ⋅ v` is always positive for a charge moving at less than the speed of light (`v < c`), so we can drop the absolute value.\n`|g'(tr)| = (cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)`\n\nNow, we can find the potential:\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * f(tr) / g'(tr)`\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * [1 / |r - s(tr)|] / [(cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)]`\n`V(r, t) = (q / 4πε₀) * (1/d) * [cd / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n`V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Vector Potential (A)\nThe derivation for `A` is analogous.\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', t_ret) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) ∫ [v(t') / |r - s(t')|] δ(t' - (t - |r - s(t')|/c)) dt'`\n\nThe integral is evaluated in the same way. The function `f(t')` is now `v(t') / |r - s(t')|`.\n`f(tr) = v(tr) / |r - s(tr)| = v / d`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * f(tr) / g'(tr)`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * (v/d) / [(cd - d ⋅ v) / (cd)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / 4π) * (v/d) * [cd / (cd - d ⋅ v)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ qcv) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   `V(r, t) = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ qcv) / (4π (cd - d ⋅ v))`\n\nThese expressions match option D exactly.\n\n*   **Option A** has a `+` sign in the denominator, which corresponds to advanced potentials (physically non-causal).\n*   **Options B and C** use the simple static potential form `q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is incorrect as it ignores the retardation effect on the distance and the motion of the charge. The distance should be `d = |r - s(tr)|`, not `r = |r|`, and the denominator needs the corrective factor `(1 - n̂ ⋅ v/c)`.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
