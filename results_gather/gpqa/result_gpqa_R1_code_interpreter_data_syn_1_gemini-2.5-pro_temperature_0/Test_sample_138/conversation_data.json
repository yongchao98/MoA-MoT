    "This problem requires identifying the starting materials for two separate reactions that produce α-diketones. The reagent system used is sodium nitrite (`NaNO2`), hydrochloric acid (`HCl`), and water (`H2O`).\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\nThe combination of `NaNO2` and `HCl` generates nitrous acid (`HONO`) in situ:\n`NaNO2 + HCl → HONO + NaCl`\n\nNitrous acid is a key reagent for the nitrosation of active methylene groups. An active methylene group is a `-CH2-` group located adjacent (in the α-position) to a carbonyl group (`C=O`). The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n\n1.  **Nitrosation:** The ketone, in its enol form, reacts with nitrous acid to form an α-oximino ketone (also known as an isonitrosoketone).\n    `R-C(=O)-CH2-R'  + HONO  →  R-C(=O)-C(=NOH)-R' + H2O`\n\n2.  **Hydrolysis:** The α-oximino ketone is then hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (provided by `HCl` and `H2O`) to yield an α-diketone.\n    `R-C(=O)-C(=NOH)-R' + H2O --(H+)--> R-C(=O)-C(=O)-R' + NH2OH`\n\nThe overall transformation is the oxidation of a methylene group (`-CH2-`) alpha to a ketone into a new carbonyl group, forming an α-diketone.\n`-C(=O)-CH2-  →  -C(=O)-C(=O)-`\n\nTherefore, the starting materials A and B must be ketones that have an α-methylene group.\n\n### Determining Starting Material A\n\n*   **Product:** 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n*   This is an α-diketone with carbonyl groups at positions C1 and C2 of a cyclohexane ring, and an isopropyl group at C4.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** To find the starting material, we must replace one of the product's carbonyl groups with a methylene group (`-CH2-`), while the other carbonyl group was present in the starting material.\n*   If we replace the C2 carbonyl with a `-CH2-` group, the starting material is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. This molecule has a carbonyl at C1 and α-methylene groups at C2 and C6. The reaction with `NaNO2/HCl` would oxidize the C2 position to give the desired product.\n*   If we replace the C1 carbonyl with a `-CH2-` group, the starting material would be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-2-one. This is the same molecule as 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, just numbered differently.\n*   Thus, starting material **A is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### Determining Starting Material B\n\n*   **Product:** 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n*   This is an acyclic α-diketone with carbonyl groups at C2 and C3. The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** We apply the same logic.\n*   If we replace the C3 carbonyl with a `-CH2-` group, the starting material is **5-methylhexan-2-one**. Its structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This ketone has a carbonyl at C2. The α-positions are C1 (a methyl group, `-CH3`) and C3 (a methylene group, `-CH2-`). Nitrosation occurs preferentially at the more reactive methylene group (C3), leading directly to the desired product, 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n*   If we replace the C2 carbonyl with a `-CH2-` group, the starting material would be 5-methylhexan-3-one (`CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`). This ketone has two different α-methylene groups (at C2 and C4), which could lead to a mixture of products. However, 5-methylhexan-2-one is a choice in the options and is a more direct precursor.\n*   Thus, the most logical starting material **B is 5-methylhexan-2-one**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** These are alcohols/diols, not ketones. They would not undergo this specific reaction to form diketones.\n*   **B) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** This matches our deductions. A is the correct ketone precursor for 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, and B is the correct ketone precursor for 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Starting material B is a diol, which is incorrect.\n*   **D) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Starting material A is an alcohol/ether, which is incorrect.\n\nThe only option where both starting materials are chemically correct for the described transformation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
