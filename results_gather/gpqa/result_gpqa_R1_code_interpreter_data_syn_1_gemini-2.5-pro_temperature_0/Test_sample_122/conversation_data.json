    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (its proper time) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Understand the physics:**\n*   From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame, time for the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n*   We first need to calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`) corresponding to the 50 seconds that passed in the ejecta's frame.\n*   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   Once we have the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance traveled using the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`, so `d = v * Δt`.\n\n**3. Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the ratio β = v/c.**\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor γ.**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50   # s\n\n# Calculate beta\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (dt)\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>This calculation gives a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n**4.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Ejecta's Frame:** This is the moving frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because, for an observer on the ejecta, the clock is at rest. We are given `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Galaxy's Frame:** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\nThis problem involves Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Specifically, it deals with the concept of **time dilation**. An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will observe that time passes more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). Therefore, the 50 seconds that pass on the ejecta's clock will correspond to a longer time interval in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**3. List the Given Values**\n*   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**4. The Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n    The Lorentz factor quantifies the effect of time dilation. It is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n    The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d)**\n    The distance traveled is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same reference frame. We use the time `Δt` that we just calculated for the Galaxy's frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    Using a calculator, `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n*   A) 2,880,000 km\n*   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect classical answer, ignoring relativity)\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
