    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a **Michael addition** reaction. The reaction involves an enolate (from the ketone) acting as a nucleophile and an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) acting as a Michael acceptor. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base used to generate the enolate.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon, substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only deprotonate the α-hydrogen at the C6 position. This forms a single, specific enolate.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. In this case, the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The enolate (nucleophilic at C6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   After the initial addition, an intermediate enolate is formed, which is then protonated during the workup step to yield the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring structure is maintained.\n    *   The substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) are unchanged.\n    *   At C6, the original hydrogen is replaced by the ethyl acrylate-derived group, which is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl group).\n    *   The resulting structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n6.  **Name the Product A and Compare with Options:**\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the propanoate chain is the parent and the cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. Let's re-name our product according to this convention to match the options.\n    *   The main chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexyl group is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated as C1.\n        *   The carbon of attachment (our original C6) has a methyl group. So, we have a **1-methyl** substituent.\n        *   The carbonyl group is on the adjacent carbon (our original C1), which becomes C2 in the substituent name. So, we have a **2-oxo** group.\n        *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (our original C2) is now C3 in the substituent name. So, we have **3-ethyl** and **3-methyl** substituents.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for A in options A and C. The name in options B and D, which describes a 4-oxo product, is incorrect as the Michael addition occurs at the α-carbon (C6), adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition**. The nitroalkane provides the nucleophile (a carbanion), and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the -NO₂ group.\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is the CH carbon attached to the methyl group.\n\n4.  **The Reaction:**\n    *   The carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new bond connects `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` to the `CH(CH₃)` part of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n6.  **Name the Product B and Compare with Options:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (-CN).\n    *   The chain is: `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for B in options A and D. The name in options B and C is incorrect; it corresponds to a different molecule with a different number of carbon atoms.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, only option A contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<A>>>"
