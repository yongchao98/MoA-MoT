    "This problem requires us to calculate the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The key is to determine which species remains in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles H+ = Volume × Concentration = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol H+\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles CH3COOH = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates to give two OH- ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles OH⁻ = 2 × Moles Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with the acids. It will first neutralize the strong acid (H+ from HCl) and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Base + Strong Acid**\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base + Weak Acid**\n    *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH.**\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of a strong base (OH⁻). The pH of the solution is determined by this excess OH⁻. The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in comparison.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of H+ from HCl\nmoles_h_plus = 0.400 * 0.2  # 0.08 mol\n\n# Moles of CH3COOH\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # 0.05 mol\n\n# Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2\nmoles_oh_minus = 2 * (0.300 * 0.3)  # 0.18 mol\n\n# Neutralization reactions\n# 1.
