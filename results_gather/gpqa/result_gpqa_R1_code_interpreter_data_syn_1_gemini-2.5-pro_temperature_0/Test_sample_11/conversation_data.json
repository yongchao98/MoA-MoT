    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$). The decay process is:\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$\n\nWe need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles. Since the speeds involved might be relativistic, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   The initial particle, the pion ($\\pi^+$), is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi^+}$) = 139.6 MeV/c². This means its rest energy is $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n*   Rest mass of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu^+}$) = 105.7 MeV/c². This means its rest energy is $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n*   The neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$) is considered massless, so its rest mass $m_{\\nu_\\mu} \\approx 0$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is stationary, its momentum is zero ($\\vec{p}_{initial} = 0$).\n    By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu} = 0$\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu_\\mu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2$\n\n    The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu^+} + E_{\\nu_\\mu}$\n\n    The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n    For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n    For the massless neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$): $E_{\\nu_\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (0)^2} = pc$.\n\n    So, the energy conservation equation is:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**4. Solve for the Unknowns**\n\nWe have one equation and one unknown, the momentum magnitude `p`. Let's solve for `pc`.\n\n1.  Rearrange the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n\n2.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n3.  The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    $2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    $KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = E_{\\nu_\\mu} = pc$\n    So, $KE_{\\nu_\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = E_{\\mu^+} - m_{\\mu^+}c^2$\n    From energy conservation, $E_{\\mu^+} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - E_{\\nu_\\mu} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$.\n    Therefore, $KE_{\\mu^+} = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - KE_{\\nu_\\mu}) - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = (m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2) - KE_{\\nu_\\mu}$.\n    The term $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2)$ is the total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value).\n\nNow, let's use a Python script to perform the calculations with the given values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum term 'pc'\n# This is also the kinetic energy of the neutrino\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = pc\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon\nke_mu = q_value - ke_nu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+) = {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu = {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nKE of mu(+) = 4.12 MeV\nKE of nu = 29.78 MeV\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$) is approximately 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV) match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, so we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the product particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\nThis means the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$) must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2}$.\n    *   For the muon: $E_{\\mu^+} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino: Neutrinos are considered massless in this context ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$), so their energy is $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation Equation:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**3. Solving for Momentum and Energies**\n\nWe can now solve this equation for the momentum term `pc`.\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n3.  Simplify by canceling the $(pc)^2$ term:\n    $(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2$\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu^+}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi^+}c^2)}$\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given rest energies:\n*   $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc \\approx 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu^+}$):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy ($KE = E - mc^2$). The total energy released in the decay is the difference in rest masses, which is shared as kinetic energy between the products.\n    Total KE = $m_{\\pi^+}c^2 - m_{\\mu^+}c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n    This total KE is distributed between the muon and the neutrino.\n    $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu^+} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    $KE_{\\mu^+} = KE_{total} - KE_{\\nu} = 33.9 - 29.78 \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is 29.8 MeV. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
