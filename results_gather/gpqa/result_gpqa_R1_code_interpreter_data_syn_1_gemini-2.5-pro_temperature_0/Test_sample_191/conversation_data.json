    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the charge inside the cavity:**\n    The positive charge $+q$ is placed inside a cavity within a spherical conductor. Conductors contain mobile charges (electrons) that will redistribute themselves in the presence of an electric field. The $+q$ charge will attract the mobile electrons in the conductor.\n\n2.  **Induced charge on the inner surface:**\n    The electrons in the conductor will be attracted towards the $+q$ charge and will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. This creates a net negative charge on the inner surface. To determine the total amount of this induced charge, we can use Gauss's Law.\n    Consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the bulk of the conductor, enclosing the cavity. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this closed surface is proportional to the net charge enclosed: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on our Gaussian surface, the flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed, $q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed inside the cavity ($+q$) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity ($q_{inner}$).\n    $q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$\n    Therefore, the total charge induced on the inner surface is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Induced charge on the outer surface:**\n    The problem states that the spherical conductor was initially uncharged. The conductor as a whole must remain electrically neutral. Since a charge of $-q$ has accumulated on the inner surface (by moving from other parts of the conductor), a net charge of $+q$ must be left behind on the conductor. These positive charges (which are actually the atomic nuclei left behind by the mobile electrons) will repel each other and move as far apart as possible, which means they will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor.\n    So, a charge of $q_{outer} = +q$ is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell is that it provides electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface and any charges external to the conductor produce zero electric field inside the conductor. Conversely, the charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner surface) produce a net zero electric field everywhere *outside* the cavity.\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is caused *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor. The internal configuration (the charge $+q$ and the induced charge $-q$) does not contribute to the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of charge on the outer surface:**\n    We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$. Since the conductor is an equipotential volume in equilibrium, and the outer surface is spherical, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the surface. The non-uniformity of the fields inside the cavity does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface due to the shielding effect.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    According to the shell theorem (which is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center O.\n\n    Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q_{outer}}{L^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The details about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor. They are extraneous information intended to test the understanding of the shielding principle. The correct expression for the electric field at point P depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P ($L$).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\n\n<<<C>>>"
