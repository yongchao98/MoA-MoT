    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 156. This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   An M+2 peak is observed at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a hallmark signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All the proposed structures (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 156 amu. The nominal mass for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂ is (7×12) + (5×1) + 37 + (2×16) = 158 amu. Thus, all options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This evidence rules out option A (an aldehyde and an alcohol) and option D (a chloroformate, which is an ester derivative and lacks the O-H group). We are left with options B and C, which are both carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is in the highly deshielded region of the spectrum, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) are consistent with this assignment.\n    *   The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region. The key information here is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H). This specific pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* compound makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals. These two sets of protons split each other, creating two doublets.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on this NMR data:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a *para* substitution pattern (the -COOH and -Cl groups are at positions 1 and 4). This structure would produce the exact NMR spectrum described: one singlet for the acid proton and two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has an *ortho* substitution pattern (groups at positions 1 and 2). This lack of symmetry would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern in the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    By systematically analyzing all the spectral data, we can confidently identify the unknown compound. The MS data points to a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, indicates a *para*-substituted benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>"
