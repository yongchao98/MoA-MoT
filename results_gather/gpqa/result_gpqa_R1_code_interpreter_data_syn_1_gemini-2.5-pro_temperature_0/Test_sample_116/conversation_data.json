    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. It has two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyl compounds, if there are large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Since each ring is asymmetrically substituted (a -NO2 group and a -COOCH3 group), the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. It is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It possesses a C2 axis of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which is a sufficient condition for it to be achiral. Dimethyl fumarate also possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
