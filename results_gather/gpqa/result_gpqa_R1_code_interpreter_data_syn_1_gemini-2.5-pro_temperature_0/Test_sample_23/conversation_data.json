    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%, which is 0.1428.\nMass fraction of H = (Atomic mass of H * y) / (Molecular mass of CxHy)\n0.1428 ≈ (1 * y) / (12 * x + 1 * y)\nThis value is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's assume the ratio is exactly 1/7.\n1/7 = y / (12x + y)\n12x + y = 7y\n12x = 6y\ny/x = 2/1\nThe empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\nZ is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12.\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane (C6H12) using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1):\n%H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\nThis confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane, C6H12.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y and its components.**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\nZ is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\nMixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means both C and D are saturated in this context. Cyclohexane (C) is saturated. For D, this means it's likely an alkane, a cycloalkane, or an aromatic compound (which does not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\n\"Hydrogenation of ... mixture Y ... gives only one substance ... Z\".\nThis means: Hydrogenation(C + D) → Z only.\nSince C is already Z (cyclohexane) and is saturated, it does not react.\nSo, the reaction is: Hydrogenation(D) → Z (cyclohexane).\nThis means D is a compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\nIf D were a saturated cycloalkane isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), this would require \"severe conditions\" to break and reform the carbon skeleton.\nHowever, a more common candidate that fits all conditions is an aromatic compound. Let's consider D = benzene (C6H6).\n- Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n- Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\nSo, a very plausible identity for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\nY = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze mixture X and the disproportionation reaction.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\nThe reaction is a disproportionation: A + B → C + D.\nSubstituting the identities of C and D we found:\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6).\nThis is a classic disproportionation reaction where hydrogen atoms are transferred from one molecule to another.\nLet's check the atom balance. The total number of atoms on the left must equal the total on the right.\nTotal C atoms = 6 + 6 = 12.\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\nSo, A and B must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nNow let's use the properties of A and B:\n- \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture X ... gives only one substance ... Z\". This means hydrogenation of A gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of B also gives cyclohexane. This implies that A and B are both C6 hydrocarbons with skeletons that can be converted to a six-membered ring.\n- So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n- From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n- Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", which means A and/or B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This implies their hydrogen counts must be less than that of the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (C6H12). So, x < 12 and y < 12.\n- \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n\nWe need to find two different integers, x and y, that satisfy:\n1.  x + y = 18\n2.  x < 12 and y < 12\n3.  C6Hx and C6Hy must be non-conjugated C6 cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons.\n\nLet's find possible pairs (x, y). Since hydrocarbons usually have an even number of hydrogen atoms, we look for even integers.\nThe only pair of distinct even integers less than 12 that sum to 18 is (8, 10).\nSo, the two liquids in mixture X have formulas C6H8 and C6H10.\n\nLet's identify the specific molecules:\n-   **C6H10**: This is cyclohexene. It has one double bond and is not conjugated. It decolorizes bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is a valid candidate.\n-   **C6H8**: This is a cyclohexadiene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule, it must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene. 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorizes bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is also a valid candidate.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe disproportionation reaction is:\nC6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\nIn this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated (oxidized) to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated (reduced) to cyclohexane. This is a valid and known type of reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid.\n-   Liquid 1 (A): C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n-   Liquid 2 (B): C6H10 (cyclohexene) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# This problem is solved through logical deduction rather than computation.\n# However, we can write a simple script to list the hydrogen counts.\nliquid_A_H_atoms = 8  # From C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene)\nliquid_B_H_atoms = 10 # From C6H10 (cyclohexene)\ntotal_H_atoms = liquid_A_H_atoms + liquid_B_H_atoms\nprint(total_H_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\nMass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))\n\nUsing approximate atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)\n\nThe value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's assume the ratio is exactly 1/7.\n1/7 = y / (12x + y)\n12x + y = 7y\n12x = 6y\ny/x = 12/6 = 2/1\n\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH2. The general molecular formula is (CH2)n, which is CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\nFurthermore, Z is \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common and simple cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12 (n=6).\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane (C6H12):\nMass % H = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 14.37%. Using integer masses: 12 / (72+12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We know that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of Y. Let's call the components of Y, C and D. So, let C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\nMixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. Therefore, the other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water. This suggests D is a saturated or aromatic compound.\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\nHydrogenation(C + D) → Z only\nHydrogenation(cyclohexane + D) → cyclohexane only\nSince cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. This means that hydrogenation of D must yield cyclohexane.\nD must be a C6 hydrocarbon that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene or alkyne. The most logical candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation produces cyclohexane:\nC6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt, pressure/heat)--> C6H12\nThus, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction.\nA + B → C + D\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved.\nTotal C atoms = 6 (from benzene) + 6 (from cyclohexane) = 12.\nTotal H atoms = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\nTherefore, the two molecules A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe are also told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons whose carbon skeletons are six-membered rings. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\nFrom the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\nKey properties of mixture X:\n1.  It \"decolorizes bromine water,\" meaning at least one component (A or B) is unsaturated (contains C=C double bonds). This means their hydrogen counts must be less than that of cyclohexane (C6H12). So, x < 12 and y < 12.\n2.  There are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n\nWe need to find two distinct even integers, x and y, that satisfy x + y = 18, with both x < 12 and y < 12. The only pair that fits is **x = 8** and **y = 10**.\nSo, the components of mixture X have the formulas C6H8 and C6H10.\n\nLet's identify the structures:\n*   **C6H10**: This is a cyclohexene. It has one double bond, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. It has no conjugated bonds. This is a valid component.\n*   **C6H8**: This is a cyclohexadiene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. The alternative, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, has conjugated double bonds and is thus excluded. 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorizes bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. The disproportionation reaction is:\nC6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\nThis is a valid catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n-   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n-   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n```python\n# The problem is solved by chemical reasoning.\n# This code simply performs the final addition as derived from the reasoning.\n# Component A of mixture X is C6H10 (cyclohexene)\n# Component B of mixture X is C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene)\nh_atoms_in_A = 10\nh_atoms_in_B = 8\ntotal_h_atoms = h_atoms_in_A + h_atoms_in_B\nprint(total_h_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>",

The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass) = (y × 1.008) / (x × 12.011 + y × 1.008)\n\nThe value 14.28% is equivalent to the decimal 0.1428. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's assume the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass is 1/7.

One component of X loses hydrogen to form benzene (oxidation), and the other component gains hydrogen to form cyclohexane (reduction).\nLet's check the conservation of atoms. The total atoms in the products are:\nTotal C atoms = 6 (from benzene) + 6 (from cyclohexane) = 12.\nTotal H atoms = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\nTherefore, the two molecules A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe are also told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane).

One component of X loses hydrogen to form benzene (oxidation), and the other component gains hydrogen to form cyclohexane (reduction).\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved.\nTotal C atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 6 (from cyclohexane) = 12.\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\nTherefore, the two molecules A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe are also told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons, and their carbon skeletons can be hydrogenated to a six-membered ring. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\nFrom the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\nWe have several constraints for A and B:\n1.  Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water,\" so at least one component must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This means their hydrogen counts must be less than that of the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (C6H12). So, x < 12 and y < 12.\n2.  \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n\nWe need to find two different integers, x and y, that satisfy x + y = 18, with both x < 12 and y < 12. Since stable hydrocarbons typically have an even number of hydrogen atoms, we look for a pair of even integers. The only pair that fits these conditions is **8 and 10**.\nSo, the components of mixture X have the formulas C6H8 and C6H10.\n\nLet's identify the specific structures:\n*   **C6H10**: This must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This fits all conditions.\n*   **C6H8**: This must be a cyclohexadiene. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This also fits all conditions.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components.\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n```python\n# This code performs the final addition based on the derived molecular formulas.\n# The first liquid in mixture X is cyclohexene, C6H10.\n# The second liquid in mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8.\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 = 10\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2 = 8\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 + hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>"
