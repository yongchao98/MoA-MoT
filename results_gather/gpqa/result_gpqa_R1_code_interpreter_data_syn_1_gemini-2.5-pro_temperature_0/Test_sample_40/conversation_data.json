    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame that is at rest with respect to the glass. The glass is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (S):** This is given as `v`. Since the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the beam, we'll consider `v` to be positive.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass frame (S'):** In any medium with a refractive index `n`, the speed of light is `c/n`. Since this is the speed measured within the glass's own rest frame (S'), we denote it as `u'`. The problem states the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass, so `u' = c/n`.\n    *   **Velocity of light relative to the lab (S):** This is the quantity we need to find, which we'll call `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    To find the velocity `u` in the laboratory frame S, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, which correctly combines velocities in special relativity. The formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    The problem states that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, to be 1.\n    *   `c = 1`\n    *   `u' = c/n = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n\n    Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    To simplify the fraction, we can find a common denominator for the numerator and the denominator, which is `n`.\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = (1 + n*v) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = [ (1 + n*v) / n ] / [ (n + v) / n ]`\n\n    We can cancel the `n` term from both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
