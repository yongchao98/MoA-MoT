    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, and its position is characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We will use the n+1 rule, where a proton signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (d of t of q)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to 1 neighboring proton (n=1). This is a -CH- group.\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2). This is a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to 3 equivalent neighboring protons (n=3). This is a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton on a chiral center (-CH-) that is adjacent to another -CH- group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (d of t of t)**\n    *   This means a different single proton is being coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to 1 neighboring proton (n=1). This is a -CH- group.\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2). This is a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, non-equivalent set of 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2). This is a second, different -CH₂- group.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton on a chiral center (-CH-) that is adjacent to another -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the protons on the main carbon chain for each option to see if they match the required splitting patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ on C2 (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets**. (Matches Signal 1)\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets. The proton on C4 is coupled to one H and six equivalent protons (from two methyl groups), giving a doublet of septets.\n    *   *Conclusion: Incorrect.*\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets**. (Matches Signal 2)\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n    *   *Conclusion: Incorrect.*\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets**. (Matches Signal 1)\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n    *   *Conclusion: Incorrect.*\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the two chiral protons on the main chain (C3 and C4).\n    *   **Proton on C3:** It is coupled to the H on C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ on C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C3 (2H, gives another triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets**. (Matches Signal 2)\n    *   **Proton on C4:** It is coupled to the H on C3 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C4 (2H, gives a triplet), and the terminal CH₃ group on C5 (3H, gives a quartet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets**. (Matches Signal 1)\n    *   *Conclusion: Correct. This molecule is the only one that contains protons corresponding to both of the complex splitting patterns described.*\n\n```python\ndef analyze_structures():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function summarizes the analysis of the 1H NMR splitting patterns for each candidate molecule.\n    The goal is to find the molecule that exhibits both a 'doublet of triplets of quartets' and a 'doublet of triplets of triplets'.\n    \n    Splitting pattern rules (n+1 rule):\n    - Coupled to 1 H -> doublet (d)\n    - Coupled to 2 H -> triplet (t)\n    - Coupled to 3 H -> quartet (q)\n    \n    Target patterns:\n    1.

    "The user wants me to identify an unknown compound from a list of four options based on its FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.
