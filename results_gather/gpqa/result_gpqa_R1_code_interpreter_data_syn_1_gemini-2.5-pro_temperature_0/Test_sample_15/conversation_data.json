    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features leading to chirality are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This molecule has no such carbon atom. The carbons of the C=C double bond are sp2-hybridized and cannot be stereocenters. The other carbons are either part of a methyl group or a methylene group (-CH2-), so they are not stereocenters either.\n    *   The molecule is essentially planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name explicitly defines the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   The designation of a specific configuration (R/S) means that the molecule has stereocenters and is being described as a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer (enantiomer) of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex, bicyclic molecule is not a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure, with identical groups (COOH) at both ends and identical substituents (H, CH3) on the two central carbons.\n    *   When a molecule has two stereocenters and a symmetrical structure, the isomer with opposite configurations (R,S or S,R) is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have an internal element of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that makes them achiral, despite the presence of stereocenters. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They do not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the (2R,3R) isomer is a chiral molecule. As a single, specified enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring path `-C2H2-C3H=`, and (4) the ring path `-C6H2-C5H2-`. Since the two paths around the ring are different (one encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are each bonded to -H, -OH, and two ring segments. Due to the symmetrical substitution, the two paths around the ring from any of these carbons are identical (e.g., from C1, the path `-C2-C3(OH)-C4-` is identical to `-C6-C5(OH)-C4-`). Therefore, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group). A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The `-CH2-` carbon has two identical hydrogens. The `-CH(CH3)2` carbon has two identical methyl groups. No carbon in the isobutyl chain is a stereocenter.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, all carbons are `-CH2-` groups except for the one attached to the carbonyl group. This carbon is attached to the carbonyl, a hydrogen, and two `-CH2-` groups in the ring. The path around the ring is symmetrical. So, no carbon in the ring is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
