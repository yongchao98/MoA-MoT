    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent 'A' must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   Looking at the options for A:\n        *   NaHSO₃ (Sodium bisulfite) is used for forming crystalline adducts with aldehydes and some ketones for purification, not as a proton source in this context.\n        *   H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents an acidic medium (e.g., from adding HCl or H₂SO₄). This provides the necessary proton to neutralize the alkoxide intermediate and form the stable cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Therefore, reagent A is H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   The second reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This hydrolysis requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   The reaction is shown to proceed in the presence of water (H₂O) and reagent B.\n    *   Looking at the remaining options for B (from options C and D):\n        *   CH₃COOH (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   HCl (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. It protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, leading to the formation of the carboxylic acid after several steps.\n    *   Therefore, reagent B is HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
