    "An isolated system consists of 13 identical particles. Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge. One particle is fixed at a point P, which we'll consider the origin. The other 12 particles are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2` m, centered at P. We need to find the minimum potential energy of this system.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy `U` of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. The potential energy of a pair of charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `r` is `U_pair = k * q1 * q2 / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n\nThe total energy of our system can be split into two components:\n1.  `U_center_shell`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (`q_center`) and the 12 charges on the shell (`q_shell`).\n2.  `U_shell_shell`: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the shell.\n\nThe total energy is `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`.\n\n**1. Energy of Central Charge with Shell Charges (`U_center_shell`)**\n\nThere are 12 pairs, each consisting of the central charge and one of the shell charges.\n-   Charge of central particle: `q_center = q = 2e`\n-   Charge of each shell particle: `q_shell = q = 2e`\n-   Distance between the center and any shell particle: `R = 2` m\n\nThe energy for each pair is `k * q * q / R = k * q^2 / R`.\nSince there are 12 such particles on the shell, the total energy for this component is:\n`U_center_shell = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nThis energy is constant because the distances are fixed by the problem's constraints.\n\n**2. Energy of Shell Charges with Each Other (`U_shell_shell`)**\n\nThere are `C(12, 2) = 12 * 11 / 2 = 66` pairs of charges on the shell. The energy for this component is:\n`U_shell_shell = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between the i-th and j-th particle on the shell.\n\nTo find the minimum total energy of the system, we need to find the arrangement of the 12 shell charges that minimizes `U_shell_shell` (since `U_center_shell` is constant). This is a classic physics problem known as the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor N=12 particles on the surface of a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\nThe energy `U_shell_shell` for this configuration can be expressed as:\n`U_shell_shell_min = (k * q^2 / R) * C_12`\nwhere `C_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of scaled reciprocal distances, `sum_{i<j} (R / r_ij)`, for the icosahedral arrangement.\n\nThe value of `C_12` for an icosahedron is a known result from the solution to the Thomson problem. It can be calculated by summing the reciprocal distances between all 66 pairs of vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R. The analytical expression is:\n`C_12 = 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3`\nNumerically, `C_12 ≈ 49.165253`.\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy (`U_total_min`)**\n\nThe minimum total energy of the system is the sum of the two components, with `U_shell_shell` at its minimum value:\n`U_total_min = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell_min`\n`U_total_min = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (C_12 * k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total_min = (12 + C_12) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nNow, we can substitute the values and calculate the result.\n-   `e = 1.602176634 x 10^-19` C\n-   `q = 2e = 3.204353268 x 10^-19` C\n-   `k = 8.9875517923 x 10^9` N m²/C²\n-   `R = 2` m\n-   `C_12 = 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3 ≈ 49.165253`\n-   `12 + C_12 ≈ 61.165253`\n\nWe will use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\ne = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs\nk = 8.9875517923e9   # Coulomb's constant in N m^2 / C^2\nR = 2.0              # Radius in meters\n\n# Charge of each particle\nq = 2 * e\n\n# The problem of finding the minimum energy configuration of 12 charges on a sphere\n# is a classic problem known as the Thomson problem for N=12.

    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the System and its Energy**\n\nThe system consists of 13 point charges. The total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can separate the total energy into two main components:\n\n*   **`U_center_shell`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the single charge at the center (point P) and the 12 charges on the spherical shell.\n*   **`U_shell_shell`**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the shell themselves.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`\n\n**2. Calculate `U_center_shell`**\n\n*   The charge of each particle is `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`1.602176634 x 10^-19` C).\n*   The central charge is at point P.\n*   The 12 shell charges are all at a fixed distance `R = 2` m from P.\n*   The potential energy between the central charge and a single shell charge is `k * q^2 / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`8.9875517923 x 10^9 N m²/C²`).\n*   Since there are 12 such charges on the shell, the total energy for this component is:\n    `U_center_shell = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nThis value is constant because `k`, `q`, and `R` are all fixed.\n\n**3. Minimize `U_shell_shell`**\n\n*   The energy among the 12 shell charges depends on their relative positions. It is given by the sum of potential energies for all `C(12, 2) = 66` pairs:\n    `U_shell_shell = k * q^2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (1 / r_ij)`\n    where `r_ij` is the distance between the i-th and j-th charge on the sphere.\n*   To find the minimum energy of the entire system, we need to find the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere that minimizes `U_shell_shell`. This requires maximizing the distances `r_ij` between the charges as much as possible.\n*   This is a famous problem in physics known as the **Thomson problem**. For `N=12` charges, the configuration that minimizes the energy is when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy**\n\nThe minimum energy of the shell configuration, `U_shell_shell_min`, can be written as:\n`U_shell_shell_min = C_12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\nwhere `C_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of the scaled reciprocal distances (`sum(R/r_ij)`) for the icosahedral arrangement. The value of this constant is a known result from the solution to the Thomson problem:\n`C_12 ≈ 49.165253`\n\nNow, we can write the total minimum energy of the system:\n`U_total_min = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell_min`\n`U_total_min = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (C_12 * k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total_min = (12 + C_12) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe can now substitute the known values and calculate the result. A Python script is used for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\ne = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs\nk = 8.9875517923e9   # Coulomb's constant in N m^2 / C^2\nR = 2.0              # Radius in meters\n\n# Charge of each particle\nq = 2 * e\n\n# The problem of finding the minimum energy configuration of 12 charges on a sphere\n# is a classic problem known as the Thomson problem for N=12. The solution is\n# that the charges arrange themselves at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n# The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two parts:\n# 1. The potential energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere (U_center_shell).\n# 2. The potential energy between the 12 charges on the sphere themselves (U_shell_shell).\n\n# U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell_min\n\n# Part 1: Energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.\n# U_center_shell = 12 * k * q**2 / R\n\n# Part 2: Minimum energy of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n# The energy can be written as U_shell_shell_min = (k * q**2 / R) * C_12, where C_12 is a dimensionless constant\n# for the icosahedral configuration (N=12). This constant is a known result from studies of the Thomson problem.\n# A known closed-form expression for this sum is:\nC_12 = 15 * math.sqrt(5 + 2 * math.sqrt(5)) + 3\n\n# Total minimum energy\n# U_total_min = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell_min\n# U_total_min = (12 * k * q**2 / R) + (C_12 * k * q**2 / R)\n# U_total_min = (12 + C_12) * (k * q**2 / R)\n\n# Calculate the energy factor\nenergy_factor = k * q**2 / R\n\n# Calculate the total energy\ntotal_energy = (12 + C_12) * energy_factor\n\n# Print the result formatted to three decimal places in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{total_energy:.3e}\")\n```\nThe code execution yields `2.822e-26`.\n\nThis value corresponds to `2.822 x 10^-26` Joules.
