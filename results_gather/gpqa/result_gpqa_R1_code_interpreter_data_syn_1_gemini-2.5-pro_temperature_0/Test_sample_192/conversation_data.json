    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the given quantities and the target quantity.**\n    *   Let `N(plx)` be the number of stars per unit parallax range. The problem states that `N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   Let `N(r)` be the number of stars per unit distance range. This is the quantity we need to find.\n    *   Let `dN` be the number of stars in a small interval.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars `dN` to the distributions.**\n    *   The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN = N(plx) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The number of stars in a small distance interval `dr` is `dN = N(r) * dr`.\n    *   Since the number of stars `dN` is the same whether we measure it by parallax or distance, we can write:\n        `N(r) * dr = N(plx) * d(plx)`\n        Note: We are interested in the relationship between the densities, so we will consider the magnitudes of the intervals `dr` and `d(plx)`.\n        `N(r) * |dr| = N(plx) * |d(plx)|`\n        This gives us the transformation rule:\n        `N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n3.  **Establish the relationship between distance (r) and parallax (plx).**\n    *   Parallax is the inverse of the distance: `plx = 1/r`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    *   We need to find how a change in distance relates to a change in parallax.\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`.\n    *   The magnitude of this derivative is `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases.\n\n5.  **Substitute the known relationships into the transformation rule.**\n    *   We have the rule: `N(r) = N(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`.\n    *   We are given `N(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We calculated `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n    *   Substituting these in, we get:\n        `N(r) ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) `\n\n6.  **Express everything in terms of the distance `r`.**\n    *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the proportionality:\n        `N(r) ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²) `\n        `N(r) ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²) `\n        `N(r) ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `N(r) ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance `r` changes as `r^3`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
