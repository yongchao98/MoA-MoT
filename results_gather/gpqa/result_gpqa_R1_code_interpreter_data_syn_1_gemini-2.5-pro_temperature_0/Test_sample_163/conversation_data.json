    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be expressed as the factor M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where radial velocities of both stars are measured), the total mass (m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2) by the following formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    (m1 + m2) * sin³(i) = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n    where:\n    *   `m1`, `m2` are the masses of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `K1`, `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves.\n\n3.  **Use the Information about Eclipses:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. Eclipses occur only when the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly for both systems:\n    M_total = m1 + m2 ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    *   For system_1: M1 ≈ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³\n    *   For system_2: M2 ≈ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³\n\n    Dividing the equation for M1 by the equation for M2:\n    M1 / M2 ≈ [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\n    The constant term `(2πG)` cancels out, leaving:\n    M1 / M2 ≈ (P1 / P2) * [ (K1_1 + K1_2) / (K2_1 + K2_2) ]³\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   **System 1:** P1 = 2 years, K1_1 = 10 km/s, K1_2 = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:** P2 = 1 year, K2_1 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s\n\n    Calculate the sum of velocities for each system:\n    *   K_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   K_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n    Now substitute these into the ratio formula:\n    M1 / M2 ≈ (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    M1 / M2 ≈ 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 ≈ 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 ≈ 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 ≈ 0.432\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. This is closest to the option C) ~ 0.4.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's perform the calculation using a Python script.\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_1 = 10.0  # km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_1 = 15.0  # km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nK_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2)\n# The formula is M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\nThe code confirms the calculation. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
