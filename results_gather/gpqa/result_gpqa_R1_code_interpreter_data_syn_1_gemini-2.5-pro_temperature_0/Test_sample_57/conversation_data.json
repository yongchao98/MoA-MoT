    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning for each option:\n\n1.  **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** and **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: These are both Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) that form parts of the Standard Model of particle physics. A fundamental feature of calculations in these theories, especially those involving virtual particle loops (Feynman diagrams with closed loops), is the appearance of infinities. These infinities arise when integrating over all possible energies and momenta of the virtual particles, with the integrals diverging at very high energies (the \"ultraviolet divergences\"). To handle these infinities and extract finite, physically meaningful predictions, a two-step process is required:\n    *   **Regularization**: A mathematical procedure to make the infinite integrals temporarily finite. This is done by introducing a parameter, such as an energy cutoff (Λ), which effectively says \"we don't know the physics above this energy scale.\"\n    *   **Renormalization**: A procedure to absorb the infinities into a redefinition of the fundamental parameters of the theory (like mass and charge).\n    Since both QED and QCD are QFTs that suffer from ultraviolet divergences, they both fundamentally require regularization.\n\n2.  **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory, while not a quantum theory, also has a famous high-energy problem. When you consider a point-like particle like an electron, the energy stored in its own electric field (its self-energy) is infinite. The energy density of the electric field is proportional to E², and for a point charge, E is proportional to 1/r². Integrating the energy density over all space to find the total energy gives an integral that diverges as the radius r approaches zero. This is a short-distance, or high-energy, divergence. Trying to \"fix\" this by giving the electron a finite size is a form of regularization, but it leads to other inconsistencies. Therefore, classical electrodynamics does have a high-energy problem that requires some form of regularization or modification.\n\n3.  **Superstring Theory**: This theory is a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity and a \"theory of everything.\" Its fundamental premise is that elementary particles are not point-like objects but rather tiny, vibrating one-dimensional \"strings.\" This seemingly small change has a profound consequence: it \"smears out\" the interactions. In QFT, interactions happen at a single point in spacetime, which is the source of the ultraviolet divergences. In string theory, strings interact over a small but finite region of spacetime. This smearing effect smooths out the interactions at high energies, naturally taming the integrals that would otherwise diverge. As a result, superstring theory is believed to be free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. It is \"UV-finite\" and therefore does not require the process of regularization to handle high-energy infinities.\n\n**Conclusion**: Among the given options, Superstring Theory is the only one that is constructed in a way that avoids high-energy divergences and thus never requires regularization for that purpose.\n\n<<<B>>>"
