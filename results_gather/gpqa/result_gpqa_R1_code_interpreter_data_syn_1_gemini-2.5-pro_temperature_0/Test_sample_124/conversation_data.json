    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is most easily solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. The Hamiltonian separates into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial q_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $q_i = x, y, z$.\n\n3.  **Recall the 1D Harmonic Oscillator Energy:** The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n4.  **Calculate the 3D Energy Eigenvalues:** The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n5.  **Define the Principal Quantum Number:** Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.

    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Understanding the System and its Energy Levels**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is most conveniently solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$.\n\nThe potential can be written as:\n$V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\nThe Hamiltonian operator $H$ can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial q_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $q_i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a single 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$.

Identifying the Third Excited State Energy**\n\nWe need to identify the energy levels corresponding to the ground state and the first few excited states:\n*   **Ground State (0th excited state):** This is the lowest energy level, which corresponds to $N=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3.

    "The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$ describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n2.  **Identifying the State:**\n    *   The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to $N=1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The second excited state corresponds to $N=2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $N=3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n3.  **Degeneracy (Number of Eigenfunctions):** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that yield the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3 ($n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$).\n\n    The general formula for the degeneracy of the N-th level is:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state ($N=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    The code execution also confirmed this result, showing that there are 10 possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3. Each of these combinations corresponds to a unique, linearly independent eigenfunction.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
