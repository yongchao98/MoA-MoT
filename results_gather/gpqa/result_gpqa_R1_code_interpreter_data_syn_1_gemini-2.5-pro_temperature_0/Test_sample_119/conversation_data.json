    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. This can be written as a differential quantity, `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars and `plx` is the parallax. We need to find how this quantity depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **State the Core Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the number density, let's call it `n`) is constant everywhere.\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume:** Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `n` is constant, the number of stars `dN` within this shell is `dN = n * dV = n * (4 * π * d^2 * dd)`.\n\n4.  **Connect Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`). The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   From this, we can express distance in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n5.  **Relate the Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to express the thickness of the shell `dd` in terms of a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx^2`.\n    *   This gives us `dd = -(1/plx^2) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply means that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can write `|dd| = (1/plx^2) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Star Count Equation:** Now we take our equation for `dN` and replace the distance-based terms (`d` and `dd`) with parallax-based terms (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   Original equation: `dN = 4 * π * n * d^2 * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = 4 * π * n * (1/plx)^2 * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)` (ignoring the sign): `dN = 4 * π * n * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = (4 * π * n / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The quantity we are looking for is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from the previous step:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4 * π * n / plx^4`\n\n8.  **Determine the Proportionality:** In this final expression, `4`, `π`, and `n` (the constant star density) are all constants. Therefore, the relationship is:\n    *   `dN/d(plx)` is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
