    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` indicates a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` means the single-atom bridge of the cyclopropane is an oxygen atom, which defines an epoxide fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The given R/S configurations define the 3D structure. A detailed analysis shows:\n    *   The epoxide ring is on the α-face (pointing \"down\" relative to the plane of the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is on the α-face (\"down\").\n    *   The hydrogen atom at C6 is on the β-face (\"up\").\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that organocuprates attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C6, C2, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack. The problem states that this results in an \"inversion of configuration\" at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.\n    *   The nucleophile (CH₃⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C-O bond being broken.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the α-face (down).\n    *   Therefore, the methyl group will attack C6 from the β-face (top).\n\n**3. Predict the Product Structure**\n\n1.  **Attack at C6:** The incoming methyl group adds to the β-face of C6. The C6-O bond breaks. This causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The original configuration of C6 was S, so the new configuration at this carbon will be R.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond also breaks, and the oxygen atom remains attached to C1. After an aqueous workup (which is standard procedure), this oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The stereochemistry at C1 is not affected by the reaction, so the -OH group will be on the α-face (down), just as the oxygen atom was.\n3.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so they retain their original R configurations.\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product**\n\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is assigned the lowest possible number, C1. So, the original C1 of the reactant is the new C1 of the product.\n2.  **Numbering:** We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now substituted with the new methyl group) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. (The alternative numbering would give 1, 3, 4, 6, which is a higher set of locants).\n    *   New C1 ← Old C1\n    *   New C2 ← Old C6\n    *   New C4 ← Old C4\n    *   New C5 ← Old C3\n3.  **Base Name:** The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-).\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe now assign the R/S configuration to each stereocenter in the product based on the reaction mechanism:\n*   **New C1 (from Old C1):** The configuration is retained. Old C1 was R. → **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (from Old C6):** The configuration is inverted. Old C6 was S. → **2R**.\n*   **New C4 (from Old C4):** The configuration is retained. Old C4 was R. → **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (from Old C3):** The configuration is retained. Old C3 was R. → **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
