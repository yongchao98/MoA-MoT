    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given organic molecule using the provided enthalpy of atomization and bond energy values. The final answer needs to be compared with the given options, which are in units of kJ/mol and kJ/g.\n\n**2. Analyze the Molecule's Structure and Formula**\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, let's determine its molecular formula by counting the carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n*   `=CH-`: 1 C; 1 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C; 2 H.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in a methyl group = 2 C; 1 H in the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C; 2 H.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 C; 1 H.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n\nTotal Carbon (C) atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\nTotal Hydrogen (H) atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds**: For an acyclic hydrocarbon with the formula CxHy, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single, double, triple) is x-1. Here, x=12, so the total number of C-C and C=C bonds is 12 - 1 = 11. Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atomization_compound)**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\nΔH_atomization_compound = (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization_compound = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atomization_compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements (ΔH_atomization_elements)**\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 is:\n12 C(graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to find the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of gaseous carbon and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound is formed from these gaseous atoms (which is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\nΔH_f = ΔH_atomization_elements - ΔH_atomization_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert to the Correct Units**\nThe calculated ΔH_f is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's check the options.\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the ΔH_atomization_compound)\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur result in kJ/mol (1900) is not an option, but options A and D are in kJ/g. We need to convert our result to kJ/g by dividing by the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (C12H22) = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's perform the calculations using a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_single = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1: Define molecular properties\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Step 2: Count the bonds\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\n\n# Step 3: Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the compound\nenthalpy_atomization_compound = (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH) + \\\n                                (num_CC_single_bonds * bond_energy_CC_single) + \\\n                                (num_CC_double_bonds * bond_energy_CC_double)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate total enthalpy of atomization of elements\n# The formation reaction is 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\nnum_H2_moles = num_H / 2\nenthalpy_atomization_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H2_moles * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = enthalpy_atomization_elements - enthalpy_atomization_compound\n\n# Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\n# Using integer atomic masses as is common in such problems (C=12, H=1)\nmolar_mass_compound = (num_C * 12.0) + (num_H * 1.0)\nenthalpy_formation_gram = enthalpy_formation_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_formation_gram}\")\n```\n> executing code...\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n>\n> <<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and bonds.\nThe molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 1 central C + 2 methyl C's = 3 C\n    *   =CH-: 1 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 chain C + 1 methyl C = 2 C\n    *   -CH2-: 1 C\n    *   -CH=: 1 C\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 1 central C + 2 methyl C's = 3 C\n    *   Total C = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 Carbon atoms**.\n\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   =CH-: 1 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 chain H + 3 methyl H = 4 H\n    *   -CH2-: 2 H\n    *   -CH=: 1 H\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total H = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 Hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds (`=`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single, double, etc.) is always one less than the number of carbon atoms.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   Since we have 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3.

It is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds.\nΔH_atomization_compound = (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\nΔH_atomization_compound = (22 × 400 kJ/mol) + (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization_compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n*(Note: This value matches option B, but it is the enthalpy of atomization, not the enthalpy of formation.)*\n\n**4.

Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound is formed from these gaseous atoms (which is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\nΔH_f = ΔH_atomization_elements - ΔH_atomization_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert to the Required Units (kJ/g)**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Options A and D are in kJ/g.
