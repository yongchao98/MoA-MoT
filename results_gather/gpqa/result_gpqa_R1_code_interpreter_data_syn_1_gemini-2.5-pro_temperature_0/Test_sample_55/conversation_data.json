    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (change in magnetic quantum number)\n    *   Parity must change, which is guaranteed by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ since parity is given by $(-1)^l$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Possible Transition Routes:**\n    The decay proceeds from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|k\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |k\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = +1$ is required, since $l=0$ cannot decrease. So, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   The problem implies the intermediate state has the principal quantum number $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states $|k\\rangle$ are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition ($|k\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states:\n            *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three intermediate states.\n        *   So, all three paths are possible:\n            *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is given by the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    Probability(route) = BranchingRatio(step 1) $\\times$ BranchingRatio(step 2).\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the First Step:**\n        The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the ratio of the partial decay rate to that state to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n        The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to k}$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle k | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        We need to compare the rates $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21m'}$ for $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n        A powerful symmetry argument can be used here: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n        This implies that the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,-1} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,0} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,1}$.\n\n        Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n        BranchingRatio($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $1/3$ for each $m'$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the Second Step:**\n        For the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a $2p$ state). The only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is also possible in principle, but the energy difference is tiny (Lamb shift), and the $\\omega^3$ dependence of the transition rate makes the decay to $1s$ overwhelmingly dominant. Therefore, we can assume the decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state proceeds to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        BranchingRatio($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n        Probability(route) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct, both the route and the probability match our calculation)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect, probability is wrong)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n\nThe only option consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
