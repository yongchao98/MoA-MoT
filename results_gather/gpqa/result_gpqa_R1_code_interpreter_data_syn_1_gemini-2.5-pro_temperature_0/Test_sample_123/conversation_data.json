    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We have particles created at the center of a spherical detector.\n    *   Detector radius, R = 30 m.\n    *   These particles are unstable and decay.\n    *   They travel at \"ultra-relativistic\" speeds, which means their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    *   The problem involves the Lorentz factor, γ, which is a key concept in special relativity.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial population `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle *in the frame where the time `t` is measured*.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ_proper` or `τ₀`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n    *   **Time of Flight:** The time it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since `v ≈ c`, we have `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Governing Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N / N₀`.\n    *   This fraction is determined by the decay law, using the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) and the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`).\n    *   So, `N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`.\n    *   Now, I'll substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n        *   `t_lab = R / c`\n        *   `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n    *   This gives the central equation: `N / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    *   Let's rearrange the exponent to make it clearer: `N / N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`.\n    *   The term `c * τ_proper` is the mean distance a particle would travel in its own lifetime if measured in the lab frame, but at rest-frame time. It's a constant for this type of particle. Let's call the constant `L_decay = c * τ_proper`.\n    *   The equation simplifies to: `N / N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * L_decay))`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Conditions:**\n\n    *   **Condition 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20.\n        *   Fraction surviving, (N/N₀)₁ = 1/3.\n        *   Radius, R = 30 m.\n        *   Plugging these into the equation: `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * L_decay))`.\n\n    *   **Condition 2 (The Goal):**\n        *   Fraction surviving, (N/N₀)₂ = 2/3.\n        *   Radius, R = 30 m.\n        *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n        *   Plugging these into the equation: `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * L_decay))`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown (γ₂):**\n    *   I have two equations and two unknowns (γ₂ and `L_decay`). I can solve this system. The easiest way is to eliminate `L_decay`.\n    *   Let's take the natural logarithm of both equations to get rid of the `exp`.\n        *   From Condition 1: `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * L_decay)` which simplifies to `-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * L_decay)` or `ln(3) = 30 / (20 * L_decay)`.\n        *   From Condition 2: `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * L_decay)` which simplifies to `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * L_decay)` or `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * L_decay)`.\n\n    *   Now, I can isolate the term `30 / L_decay` in both equations.\n        *   From eq 1: `30 / L_decay = 20 * ln(3)`.\n        *   From eq 2: `30 / L_decay = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`.\n\n    *   Since both expressions equal `30 / L_decay`, I can set them equal to each other:\n        `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n    *   Finally, I can solve for γ₂:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   This is a numerical calculation. I can use a calculator or a simple script to get an accurate value. I'll use Python.\n    *   The expression is `20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The derived formula for the new Lorentz factor (gamma_2) is:\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# where ln is the natural logarithm.\n\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n<<<\n54.18958483012202\n>>>\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Finalize:**\n    *   The calculated value is ~54.2.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 68\n        B) 54\n        C) 40\n        D) 28\n    *   The value 54 is the closest integer to my calculated result.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on particle decay. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is extended in the lab frame compared to its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame):\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to travel the radius `R` of the detector at a velocity `v` is:\n\n`t = R / v`\n\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`, so we can approximate `t ≈ R / c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\nThe term `c * τ_proper` is a constant for a given type of particle, representing its mean decay length. Let's call the constant term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant `K`, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, we solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the provided code output for the calculation:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
