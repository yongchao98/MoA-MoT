    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which involves the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride can act as a dehydrating agent to form an intermediate that enolizes more readily, and bromine then adds to the alpha-carbon. Pyridine, a mild base, neutralizes the HBr byproduct.\n*   **Product 1:** The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n    CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid group is converted to an ethyl ester.\n    Br-CH2-COOH + CH3CH2OH → Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion in a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano group (-CN) and the ester group (-COOEt) are acidic (this is an active methylene group). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a carbanion.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic proton on the alpha-carbon, which is removed by the excess NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a ring. The ring consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This symmetry makes:\n    *   The two sides of the ring equivalent (C2 is equivalent to C6; C3 is equivalent to C5).\n*   **Analysis of Hydrogen Environments:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C1:** Has no hydrogens.\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. On C2, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule). Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two different signals. The same applies to C6. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the protons on these carbons give a total of **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** These positions are also equivalent. Similar to C2/C6, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. This pair of positions contributes **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This position lies on the plane of symmetry but its two hydrogens are also diastereotopic. Replacing one versus the other with a different group would create diastereomers. Thus, they are chemically non-equivalent and give **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nTo verify this analysis, we can use a computational chemistry tool.\n\n```python\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\ndef count_nmr_signals(smiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of distinct 1H NMR signals for a molecule\n    by finding the number of non-equivalent hydrogen atoms using canonical ranks.\n    \"\"\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    if not mol:\n        print(\"Invalid SMILES string\")\n        return None\n    \n    mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n    \n    # CanonicalRankAtoms assigns the same rank to symmetrically equivalent atoms.\n    ranks = list(Chem.CanonicalRankAtoms(mol, breakTies=True))\n    \n    # Collect the ranks of all hydrogen atoms.\n    h_ranks = []\n    for atom in mol.GetAtoms():\n        if atom.GetAtomicNum() == 1:  # It's a hydrogen atom\n            h_ranks.append(ranks[atom.GetIdx()])\n            \n    # The number of unique ranks among hydrogens is the number of distinct 1H NMR signals.\n    num_signals = len(set(h_ranks))\n    return num_signals\n\n# The SMILES string for the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\nsmiles_product_4 = \"CCOC(=O)C1(C#N)CCCCC1\"\n\n# Calculate and print the number of signals.\nnumber_of_signals = count_nmr_signals(smiles_product_4)\nprint(f\"The number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals is: {number_of_signals}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Bromine is added to the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step alkylation process followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The hydrogens on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The strong base NaH removes one proton to form a stable carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons bearing a bromine atom on 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation & Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon is removed to form a new carbanion. This carbanion then attacks the other end of the pentyl chain in an intramolecular SN2 reaction, displacing the second bromide and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This, along with free rotation of the ester group, creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This makes the molecule achiral on the NMR timescale.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The two sides of the ring are equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n*   **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are rendered enantiotopic by the molecular plane of symmetry. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   **C2 and C6 protons:** These positions are equivalent. The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in any given chair conformation) are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for C6. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent, the protons on these two carbons give a total of **2 signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 protons:** These positions are equivalent. Similar to C2/C6, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. This pair of positions contributes **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4 protons:** This position lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are diastereotopic. This is because replacing one proton with a different group (e.g., Deuterium) would create a diastereomer relative to replacing the other proton (e.g., creating a cis vs. trans relationship to the substituents on C1). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and give **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for -CH3) + 1 (for -CH2-) = 2 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 2 (for C4) = 6 signals.\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\n<<<C>>>"
