    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the alkene is preserved in the epoxide. A *trans*-alkene gives a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is achiral, the chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture. The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom (an Sₙ2-like, *anti*-attack).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the racemic epoxide mixture:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes anti-attack by water, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol (which is the same as the (4S,5R)-diol). This is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide also undergoes anti-attack, leading to the same (4S,5R)-diol (meso).\n    *   Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the same *anti*-attack ring-opening as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide):\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configured) inverts it to S, giving the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-configured) inverts it to R, giving the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, the two enantiomeric products must be formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will have the same retention time, eluting as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will elute together as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will elute at a different time as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**. The meso-diol is achiral and will elute as a **single, third peak** (at a different retention time from the other two, as it is a diastereomer).\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
