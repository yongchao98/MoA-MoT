    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Deduce the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided about the compound to determine its chemical structure.\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the compound has a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. The core formula is C6H4.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group (C=O).\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\nNow, let's piece this information together:\n*   We have two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   The only common chemical group that fits this description (2 carbons, 1 carbonyl) is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure perfectly matches all the given criteria.\n\n**2. Predict the Expected 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nNow that we have the structure, we can predict what its 1H NMR spectrum should look like. A haloacetophenone molecule has two main sets of protons:\n\n*   **The Acetyl Methyl Protons (-COCH3)**: These three protons are on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of **2.0-2.6 ppm**, and the signal will integrate to **3H**.\n*   **The Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**: There are four protons on the benzene ring. Their chemical shifts will be in the aromatic region, typically **7.0-8.5 ppm**. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given NMR Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on our prediction.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons at 2.3 ppm. This is a perfect match for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: These are two signals in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **para (1,4-) disubstituted** benzene ring. This high degree of symmetry is expected for a para-isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The chemical shifts are incorrect for the proposed structure.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde, its substituents would be -CHO and a halogen -X. This structure (X-C6H4-CHO) only has 7 carbon atoms, which contradicts the given information of 8 total carbons.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signals and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. For example, a 1H singlet in the aromatic region is not expected for this type of compound.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The key features are the 3H singlet for the acetyl group and the characteristic pattern of two 2H doublets in the aromatic region, indicating a para-substituted ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
