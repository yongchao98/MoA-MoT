    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The ability to distinguish two energy levels is limited by the inherent uncertainty in their energy values. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle connects the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt or τ). The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s or 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Variables:**\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the quantum state, τ.\n    *   ΔE represents the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the state, often referred to as the natural linewidth or energy width (Γ). For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can approximate this as:\n        ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolving Energy Levels:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be at least on the order of the larger of the two energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this will be the limiting factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n\n5.  **Identify the Limiting Factor:** Since τ₁ < τ₂, it follows that ΔE₁ > ΔE₂. The broader energy level (State 1) is the one that makes it harder to distinguish the two states. Therefore, the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be at least on the order of, and preferably greater than, ΔE₁.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** Let's calculate the larger energy width, ΔE₁, in electron-volts (eV) to match the units in the options.\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The required energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Let's examine the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (<< 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV   (>> 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV   (<< 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV   (<< 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, is significantly larger than the calculated minimum energy width required for the levels to be resolved. The other options represent energy differences that are smaller than the uncertainty of the broader state, making it impossible to distinguish them.\n\nTo confirm the numerical calculation, we can use a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (width) for each state using delta_E ~ hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (shorter lifetime): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (longer lifetime): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# To resolve the states, the energy difference must be greater than the energy widths.\n# The limiting factor is the larger width, which is delta_E1.\nprint(f\"The minimum energy difference for resolution must be greater than ~{delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the options:\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_E1:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is a valid choice.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {key} ({value:.1e} eV) is too small.\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nEnergy width of state 1 (shorter lifetime): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (longer lifetime): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe minimum energy difference for resolution must be greater than ~6.582e-07 eV.\n\nComparing options:\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is too small.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a valid choice.\nOption C (1.0e-09 eV) is too small.\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV) is too small.\n</execute_code>\nThe code output confirms the reasoning. The energy width of the state with the 10⁻⁹ s lifetime is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be larger than this value. Out of the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty in its energy.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ).\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nFor a quantum state with a lifetime τ, the uncertainty in time Δt is the lifetime itself. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is often called the natural linewidth or energy width (Γ). We can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Widths:**\nWe need to calculate the energy width for each state. We will use the value of the reduced Planck constant in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s):\nħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Condition for Resolution:**\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). This larger width is the limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Comparing with the Options:**\nWe need to find the option that satisfies this condition.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much less than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is much less than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>"
