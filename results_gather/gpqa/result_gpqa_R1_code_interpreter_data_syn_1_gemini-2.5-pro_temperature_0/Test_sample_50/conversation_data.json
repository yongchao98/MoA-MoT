    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The real induced charges on the sphere's surface are replaced by this fictitious image charge for the purpose of calculation outside the sphere.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   Through standard derivation (by ensuring the potential is zero at points on the sphere), the properties of the image charge are found to be:\n        *   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge) changes.\n\n    A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the final image charge `q'` as `U = k*q*q'/(d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the location of `q`.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of the charge `q` created by all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the induced charges are themselves created by `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Potential at the location of q:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced surface charge is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        *   `q' = -qR/d`\n        *   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   Now use the correct energy formula: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has RÂ²)\n    *   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect (wrong sign in denominator, has d instead of R)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n\nThe derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
