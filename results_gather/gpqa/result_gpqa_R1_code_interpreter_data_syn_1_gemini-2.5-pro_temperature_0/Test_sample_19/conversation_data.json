    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is that a high-energy probe interacts with a single nucleon inside a nucleus so quickly that the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle during the interaction. The \"impulse\" refers to the large momentum and energy transferred in a very short time.\n\nLet's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a fundamental prerequisite. If the probe interacted with multiple nucleons at once (e.g., through meson-exchange currents), we could not isolate a single nucleon and treat it as the primary target. The interaction must be localized to one nucleon to even begin treating that nucleon as a \"free\" entity. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. It means we ignore \"final-state interactions\" (where the struck nucleon or other outgoing particles re-scatter off the remaining nucleons) and \"initial-state interactions\" (where the incoming probe scatters before hitting the target nucleon). This ensures that the process we observe is the \"clean\" interaction with the single nucleon, not a more complex, multi-step process. This is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation, or PWIA).\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This is an assumption about the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not about its interaction with the nuclear environment. The impulse approximation is concerned with ignoring the effects of the surrounding nucleons (the binding potential). One can apply the impulse approximation while still using a fully relativistic description of the nucleon's internal structure (its form factors). Therefore, assuming non-relativistic quarks is a separate, additional approximation related to the nucleon model, not a defining feature of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the central dynamical assumption of the impulse approximation. The \"impulse\" is assumed to be delivered over a timescale much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nuclear potential. Because the interaction is so fast, the nucleon's state (its momentum and position) is effectively \"frozen,\" and it doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the binding potential *during* the collision. It responds as a free particle would. This assumption is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe impulse approximation is defined by the combination of treating the interaction as a one-nucleon process (Assumption 1), ignoring the effects of the nuclear medium on the particles before and after the collision (Assumption 2), and ignoring the binding potential during the brief collision (Assumption 4). Assumption 3 is a separate modeling choice concerning the nucleon's internal structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
