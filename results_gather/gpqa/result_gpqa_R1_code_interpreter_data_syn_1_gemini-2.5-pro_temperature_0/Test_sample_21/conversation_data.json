    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Analyze the thermodynamic aspect.**\n\n1.  **Identify the core concept:** The strength of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n2.  **Find the relevant chemical reactions:** We need to compare the reduction of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   **In acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    *   **In basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n3.  **Compare the standard reduction potentials (E°):**\n    *   The standard reduction potential for the reaction in acidic solution is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   The standard reduction potential for the reaction in basic solution is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n4.  **Draw a conclusion:** Since +0.40 V (basic) is significantly lower than +1.23 V (acidic), oxygen is a thermodynamically **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n5.  **Fill in the first blank:** The statement \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions\" should be filled with **weaker**. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze the kinetic aspect.**\n\n1.  **Identify the core concept:** Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction, which is determined by factors like activation energy.\n2.  **Analyze the oxygen molecule:** The dioxygen molecule (O₂) contains a strong double bond (O=O). The bond dissociation energy is high (approximately 498 kJ/mol).\n3.  **Relate bond strength to reaction rate:** For a reaction to occur, bonds in the reactants must be broken. Breaking this strong O=O bond requires a large amount of energy, which translates to a high activation energy for the reaction.\n4.  **Draw a conclusion:** A high activation energy means that the reaction proceeds very slowly under normal conditions. Therefore, the reduction of oxygen is kinetically **slower**. This is true in general, including in acidic solutions. Even though oxygen is a powerful oxidant thermodynamically in acid, its reactions are often slow.\n5.  **Fill in the second blank:** The statement \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions\" should be filled with **slower**.\n\n**Part 3: Combine the results.**\n\n*   From Part 1, the first word is **weaker**.\n*   From Part 2, the second word is **slower**.\n\nThe correct combination is **weaker - slower**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
