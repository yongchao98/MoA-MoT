    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). Since it's a single stereoisomer, it is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (`C=O`) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (`-CH(OH)-`).\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction produces a mixture of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2` group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH₄ is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This product has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze them:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (it is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains 5 total stereoisomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different physical properties, they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives another peak.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times. Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n        *   The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n        *   The meso compound is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other two products. It will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n        *   In total, the products from Reaction II give **3 peaks**.\n    *   Again, there will be no overlap between the peaks from Reaction I and Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
