    "*   **Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\n    The reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH2) in a suitable solvent (liquid ammonia). These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position C1. The ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n    The base can abstract a proton from either of these positions, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The NH2⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C6. Simultaneously, the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step. This intermediate is called 3-deuterobenzyne.\n        (Note: Abstraction of H is kinetically faster than abstraction of D due to the kinetic isotope effect, so this is the major pathway, but the question asks for all *possible* products).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2, and the bromide ion (Br⁻) leaves from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. This benzyne intermediate has no deuterium atoms; it is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne.\n\n*   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the deuterium is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the deuterium is at C2. The relative positions of -NH2 and -D are meta (1,3). This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.\n        3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C6H5NH2), which contains no deuterium.\n\n*   **Step 4: Count the Distinct Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
