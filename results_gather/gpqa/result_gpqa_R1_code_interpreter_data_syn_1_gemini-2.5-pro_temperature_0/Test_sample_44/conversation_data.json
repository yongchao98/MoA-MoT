    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Single-Particle States and Energies**\n\n*   The system consists of particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   The energy levels for a single particle in this potential well are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$, where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   The problem provides a base energy unit E = $\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to express $E_n$ in terms of E.\n*   Recall that $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, so $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$.\n*   Substituting this into the energy formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{(2\\pi\\hbar)^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{4\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n*   Therefore, the energy of a single particle in the n-th level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n**2. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\n*   The particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions.\n*   Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   For this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number $m_s$ (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n*   This means that for each energy level `n`, there are two available quantum states: (n, spin-up) and (n, spin-down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n**3. Determine the Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)**\n\n*   The ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we must fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n    $E_{gs} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n    $E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**4. Determine the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from n=2 to the next available level, n=3.\n*   **First excited state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1^2E) + (1 \\times 2^2E) + (1 \\times 3^2E)$\n    $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n    $E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**5. Determine the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   Let's consider possible configurations with energy greater than 15E:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3 (from the ground state).\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3 (from the ground state).\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (from the ground state).\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n*   Comparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after 15E is 18E.\n*   Therefore, the second excited state energy is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\nTo confirm this systematically, a Python script can be used to generate all valid configurations and calculate their energies.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies for a system of 4 spin-1/2 fermions\n    in a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_particles = 4\n    max_level_to_check = 6  # Check up to n=6, should be sufficient\n    \n    # Generate all possible sets of 4 single-particle levels\n    # We use combinations_with_replacement because particles can be in the same level\n    # e.g., (1, 1, 2, 2)\n    levels = range(1, max_level_to_check + 1)\n    all_configs = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(levels, num_particles)\n    \n    valid_energies = set()\n    \n    for config in all_configs:\n        # Check Pauli Exclusion Principle: a level n can appear at most twice\n        is_valid = True\n        for level in set(config):\n            if config.count(level) > 2:\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_valid:\n            # Calculate the total energy for this configuration\n            # Energy is sum of n^2, in units of E\n            energy = sum(n*n for n in config)\n            valid_energies.add(energy)\n            \n    # Sort the unique energies and get the lowest three\n    sorted_energies = sorted(list(valid_energies))\n    \n    ground_state = sorted_energies[0]\n    first_excited = sorted_energies[1]\n    second_excited = sorted_energies[2]\n    \n    print(f\"The three lowest energies are: {ground_state}E, {first_excited}E, {second_excited}E\")\n\nfind_energies()\n```\n>>>\n```\nThe three lowest energies are: 10E, 15E, 18E\n```\nThe code confirms the manually calculated results.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We can express $E_n$ in terms of E.\nSince $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we have $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$. Substituting this into the energy formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{(2\\pi\\hbar)^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{4\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nSo, the energy of the n-th level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number $m_s$ (spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1 ($E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** Place 2 particles.\n*   **Level n=2 ($E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** Place the remaining 2 particles.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest possible energy. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1^2E) + (1 \\times 2^2E) + (1 \\times 3^2E)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, etc.), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
