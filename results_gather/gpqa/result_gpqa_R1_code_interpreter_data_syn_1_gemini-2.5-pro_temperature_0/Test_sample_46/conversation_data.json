    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. It is too high for a simple amide (~1660 cm⁻¹) and in the correct range for an α,β-unsaturated or aryl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the two substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n*   Placing these on the ring in a para-arrangement: The protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group will be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and have an N-H proton integrating to 1H in the NMR. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with appropriate electronic effects reflected in the NMR chemical shifts. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹). Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
