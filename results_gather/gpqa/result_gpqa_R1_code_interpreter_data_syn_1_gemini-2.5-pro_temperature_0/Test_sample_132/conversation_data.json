    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the composition of the solution:**\n*   The solution is made by dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in water.\n*   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n*   Therefore, the solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). This constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Identify the relevant chemical equilibria:**\nThe chemistry of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) involves three dissociation steps:\n*   H3PO4 <=> H+ + H2PO4- ; Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3\n*   H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n*   HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n\nSince our solution contains significant amounts of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, the primary equilibrium that determines the pH of the solution is the second one, governed by Ka2. The species we want to find, the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-), is produced in the third equilibrium, governed by Ka3.\n\n**3. Plan the calculation:**\n*   **Step A:** Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components, [H2PO4-] and [HPO4^2-].\n*   **Step B:** Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (or the Ka2 expression directly) for the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- buffer system to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+].\n*   **Step C:** Use the Ka3 equilibrium expression along with the calculated [H+] and the initial [HPO4^2-] to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-].\n\n**4. Execute the calculation using a Python script for precision.**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step A: Calculate initial concentrations\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\n\n# Moles of each component\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Concentrations of each component\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step B: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\n# Rearranging for [H+]:\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step C: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# The relevant equilibrium is HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n# Rearranging for [PO4^3-]:\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (conc_hpo4)\n# because Ka3 is very small, so very little HPO4^2- will dissociate further.\nconc_po4 = Ka3 * conc_hpo4 / H_plus\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4:.3e}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",

Identify the components and their roles:**\n*   The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n*   In water, KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n*   The key species are H2PO4- (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, HPO4^2-. Together, they form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Determine the relevant chemical equilibria:**\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps, each with an acid dissociation constant (Ka):\n*   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n*   **H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-  (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)**\n*   **HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)**\n\nThe primary equilibrium that sets the pH of our buffer is the second one, involving the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- pair.
