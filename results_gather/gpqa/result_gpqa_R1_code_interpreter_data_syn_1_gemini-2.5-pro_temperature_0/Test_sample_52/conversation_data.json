    "Here is my reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring with two substituents. This structure itself accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one for the ring and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **1H NMR shows vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This adds another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The total DoU required for the molecule is the sum of these contributions: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Option:**\n    The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens (oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation). I will use a Python script to calculate this for each option to ensure accuracy.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dou(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d+)', formula)\n        counts = {el: int(num) for el, num in parts}\n        C = counts.get('C', 0)\n        H = counts.get('H', 0)\n        # DoU = C + 1 - H/2\n        dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n        return dou\n\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C11H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C12H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    expected_dou = 6\n    print(f\"Expected DoU based on structure: {expected_dou}\")\n    for label, formula in options.items():\n        dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {label} ({formula}): DoU = {int(dou)}\")\n\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    Expected DoU based on structure: 6\n    Option A (C11H12O2): DoU = 6\n    Option B (C11H14O2): DoU = 5\n    Option C (C12H14O2): DoU = 6\n    Option D (C12H12O2): DoU = 7\n    ```\n    This calculation eliminates options B and D, as their DoU does not match the required value of 6. The correct answer must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H14O2).\n\n3.  **Detailed Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically indicate a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which results in chemical symmetry. This means the ring fragment is C6H4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the first vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by its neighbor. The proton on the second vinyl carbon is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** One signal is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which would be a doublet. The other signal must come from the ester part of the molecule. Since there are no `-CH2-` groups, this cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). It must be a methyl group, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this fragment is `CH3`.\n    *   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial constraint.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the fragments identified from the NMR data:\n    *   Aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   Propenyl group: `C3H5`\n    *   Ester group: `-COO-` -> `CO2`\n    *   Second methyl group: `CH3`\n\n    Total Carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (methyl) = 11\n    Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = 12\n    Total Oxygen atoms = 2 (ester)\n\n    The molecular formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check and Elimination:**\n    *   The derived formula `C11H12O2` matches option A.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate option C (`C12H14O2`). To get from `C11H12O2` to `C12H14O2`, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogens, which is a `-CH2-` group. However, the problem explicitly states there are no signals for `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, `C12H14O2` is incorrect.\n    *   Another way to disprove `C12H14O2` is by proton count. Total protons = 14. The fragments we identified (`C6H4`, `-CH=CH-CH3`) account for 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (propenyl methyl) = 9 protons. This leaves 14 - 9 = 5 protons to be accounted for by the second methyl signal. A methyl signal must integrate to a multiple of 3 (e.g., 3H, 6H), so 5 protons is impossible.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only formula that fits all the given data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
