    "Here is the reasoning process to determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Provided Expression:**\n    The expression for the \"size estimate\" of the Feynman diagram is given as:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n    In quantum field theory, such an expression for a diagram's amplitude can be broken down into several parts:\n    *   **Coupling Constants:** `alpha^3 * g^2` (determines the strength of interactions).\n    *   **Numerical Factors:** `sqrt(2) * 8` (from symmetry, group theory, traces, etc.).\n    *   **Kinematic Factors:** `(Q/M)^2` (dependence on external energies `Q` and particle masses `M`).\n    *   **Loop Factors:** `1/(4pi)^6` (arises from integrating over undetermined momenta in closed loops).\n\n2.  **Identify the Loop-Counting Factor:**\n    The most direct way to determine the number of loops (`L`) is by examining the loop factor. In calculations involving Feynman diagrams, each closed loop corresponds to an integral over an undetermined momentum variable (e.g., `d^4k`). The evaluation of these integrals in `d` spacetime dimensions using standard regularization techniques (like dimensional regularization) consistently yields a factor of `1/(4π)^(d/2)` for each loop.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula for Four Dimensions:**\n    The problem states that the theory is on **four-dimensional spacetime**, so we set `d=4`.\n    The factor contributed by a single loop is therefore:\n    `1 / (4π)^(4/2) = 1 / (4π)^2`\n\n    If a diagram has `L` loops, the total contribution from all the loop integrals will be the product of the individual loop factors:\n    `(1 / (4π)^2)^L = 1 / (4π)^(2L)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Number of Loops (L):**\n    We now compare the general formula for the loop factor with the specific factor found in the colleague's note, which is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\n    `1 / (4π)^(2L) = 1 / (4π)^6`\n\n    For this equality to hold, the exponents in the denominator must be equal:\n    `2L = 6`\n\n    Solving for `L`, we get:\n    `L = 6 / 2 = 3`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops. The other terms in the expression, while important for the full calculation, are not needed to determine the loop number. The power of the `1/(4π)` factor is the key.\n\nThe number of loops is 3. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
