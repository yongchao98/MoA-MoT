Identify the Physical System and Energy Formula**\n*   The problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the standard potential for a **three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator**. \"Isotropic\" implies the potential is spherically symmetric, so the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for motion along all three Cartesian axes.\n*   The energy eigenvalues for this quantum system are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Here, $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are any non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). This means $n$ can also be any non-negative integer.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n*   The energy levels are enumerated by the principal quantum number $n$. The ground state is the lowest possible energy level. We must find the value of $n$ corresponding to the \"third excited state.\"\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   The energy of the third excited state is therefore **$(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Number of Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\n*   The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of unique combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n*   **Method A: Direct Enumeration**\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → **3 states**\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → **6 states**\n    *   The single combination (1, 1, 1) → **1 state**\n    *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n*   **Method B: Degeneracy Formula**\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is: $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$): $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n*   Both methods confirm that there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### **Careful Points and Common Pitfalls**\n\n1.  **Correct System Identification:** It is crucial to recognize the potential as a 3D harmonic oscillator and use the correct energy formula.

Identify the Physical System and Energy Formula**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the standard potential for a **three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator**.\nThe energy eigenvalues for this quantum mechanical system are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number. The individual quantum numbers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...), and therefore, so can $n$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: System Identification.** It is critical to use the correct energy formula.

Identify the Physical System and Energy Formula**\n*   The problem describes a particle in a potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the standard potential for a **three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator**. \"Isotropic\" implies the potential is spherically symmetric, so the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for motion along all three Cartesian axes.\n*   The energy eigenvalues for this quantum system are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n*   Here, $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are any non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). This means $n$ can also be any non-negative integer.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n*   The energy levels are enumerated by the principal quantum number $n$. The ground state is the lowest possible energy level. We must find the value of $n$ corresponding to the \"third excited state.\"\n*   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   The energy of the third excited state is therefore **$(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Number of Eigenfunctions (Degeneracy)**\n*   The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (eigenfunctions) that share the same energy. For the third excited state ($n=3$), we need to find the number of unique combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n*   **Method A: Direct Enumeration**\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → **3 states**\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) → **6 states**\n    *   The single combination (1, 1, 1) → **1 state**\n    *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n*   **Method B: Degeneracy Formula**\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is: $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$): $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n*   Both methods confirm that there are **10** linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.\n\n### **Careful Points and Common Pitfalls**\n\n1.  **Correct System Identification:** It is crucial to recognize the potential as a 3D harmonic oscillator and use the correct energy formula. The options containing the term $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2)$ are for a particle in an infinite spherical potential well, a different system entirely. This allows for the immediate elimination of options A and D.\n2.  **Correct State Counting:** A frequent \"off-by-one\" error is miscounting the excited states. The ground state corresponds to $n=0$. Therefore, the **third** excited state is the third level *above* the ground state, which corresponds to $n=3$.\n3.  **Degeneracy of the Correct State:** The degeneracy must be calculated for the correct quantum number, $n=3$.
