There is a strong consensus among all provided analyses on this structure.\n\n*   **Careful Points from the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Identifier for Carboxylic Acid O-H:** The extremely broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is a definitive and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). This is the primary functional group identifier.\n    *   **Identifier for Carbonyl (C=O):** The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O stretch. Its position (slightly lower than a non-conjugated acid) suggests the carbonyl group is conjugated with the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Identifier for Aromatic Ring:** The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is unequivocally an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Points from the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Identifier for Carboxylic Acid H:** The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is the classic signal for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a -COOH group, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **Identifier for Substitution Pattern:** The pair of doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) is a tell-tale sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal is due to the protons being adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Identifier for Alkyl Group Structure:** The remaining signals are assembled to identify the second substituent. The key is to correctly piece together the fragments indicated by the splitting patterns.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine (-CH-) proton directly attached to the ring (benzylic position).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl (-CH₃) group attached to that benzylic methine.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` and `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) that is also attached to the benzylic methine.\n    *   **Assembling the Substituent:** A methine carbon attached to the ring, a methyl group, and an ethyl group forms a **sec-butyl** group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to determine the outcome of the chemical transformation. Again, all analyses agree on the reaction's function.\n\n*   **Careful Point on Reagents:** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is known as a very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Careful Point on Transformation:** The primary function of P/HI in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   **Careful Point on Selectivity:** This reaction is selective. It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl side chain. Crucially, it does not cause skeletal rearrangement of the alkyl group.\n*   **Conclusion for the Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a methyl group. The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Predicted Product with the Provided Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the correct choice from the list provided in the problem description.\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This perfectly matches the name and structure of the predicted final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This is incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, as confirmed by NMR, and this does not rearrange to an isobutyl group during the reaction.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an entirely different molecular structure, inconsistent with both the starting material and the reaction.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis leads to a single, unambiguous final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires a careful, systematic analysis of spectroscopic data followed by the prediction of a chemical reaction's outcome.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first objective is to elucidate the structure of Compound X by interpreting its Infrared (IR) and ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis (Spectroscopy):**\n\n1.  **Identify the Primary Functional Group (IR):** The IR spectrum shows two critical peaks:\n    *   A very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is the unambiguous signature of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position, slightly lower than a non-conjugated acid, suggests it's part of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   *Conclusion:* Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR peak at **10.5 ppm** (a broad singlet for 1H) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming this conclusion.\n\n2.  **Determine the Aromatic Substitution Pattern (¹H NMR):**\n    *   The aromatic region shows two distinct doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)**. This specific A₂B₂ pattern is a clear indication of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (shifted downfield) because they are adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n\n3.  **Identify the Alkyl Group Isomer (¹H NMR):**\n    *   The remaining signals describe the second substituent. We must piece them together to identify the specific isomer (e.g., sec-butyl vs. isobutyl vs. tert-butyl).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) proton, and its chemical shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the single methine proton, hence it's a doublet.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** and **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This triplet and multiplet pair describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Assembling the group:** The benzylic carbon (-CH-) is attached to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. This creates a **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃** structure, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining these findings, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group in a para orientation. Its IUPAC name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second objective is to determine what happens when 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid reacts with the given reagents.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis (Reaction):**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reagents' Function:** The reagents are **red phosphorus and HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent system.\n\n2.  **Know the Specific Transformation:** The most well-known use for red P / HI in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) directly to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n3.  **Consider Selectivity and Side Reactions:** This reaction is highly selective for the carboxyl group. The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain will not be affected. No skeletal rearrangements of the alkyl group occur under these conditions.\n\n**Conclusion for Final Product:**\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that correctly names the final product.\n\n*   Predicted Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The starting material contains a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This structure is inconsistent with the starting material and the reaction.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, a common distractor.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct.** This name and structure exactly match the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a multi-step problem that requires careful analysis of spectroscopic data followed by the prediction of a chemical reaction's outcome. All candidate answers correctly follow the same logical path.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first task is to identify the reactant by interpreting its IR and ¹H NMR spectra. This is a crucial step where careful attention to detail is necessary.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** region is the most definitive evidence of an **O-H bond in a carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The sharp, strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid conjugated with a benzene ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of **C=C bonds within an aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The IR data unambiguously identifies Compound X as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis.**\n    *   **Acidic Proton:** The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)** is the classic signal for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a **-COOH group**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The pair of doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** is the signature pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their downfield shift.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** The remaining signals must be assembled to identify the second substituent.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) proton. Its downfield shift indicates it is *benzylic* (directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the single benzylic proton.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** and **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** These signals describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) at 1.7 ppm is coupled to both the methyl group and the benzylic proton, making it a complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembly:** Connecting the pieces, the substituent is a benzylic methine (-CH-) bonded to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. This structure, **-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)**, is a **sec-butyl group**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D), which is a common distractor representing the reactant, not the product.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Product of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reagents and Reaction Type.**\n    *   The reagents are **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Selectivity.**\n    *   The reaction is selective. It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl group. No rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n    *   **Transformation:** The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a -CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product is a benzene ring substituted in a para-orientation with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group. The correct name is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the Final Product to the Options**\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This name and structure exactly match the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is incorrect. The NMR data clearly define a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl isomer. The reaction does not cause this type of rearrangement.\n*   **C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This is an entirely different and incorrect molecular structure.\n*   **D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material, not the final product of the reaction.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the spectral data and the chemical reaction, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a two-step analysis: first, deducing the structure of the starting material from its spectroscopic data, and second, predicting the product of the given chemical reaction. All provided candidate answers correctly perform this analysis, and their reasoning is sound.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of Compound X is determined by a careful, combined analysis of its Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum - Careful Points:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive and unmistakable feature. This signal corresponds to the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is typical for a carboxylic acid where the carbonyl is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of C=C bond stretching within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR**: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum - Careful Points:**\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)**, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The pair of doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** is a tell-tale signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their strong downfield shift.\n    *   The remaining signals must be assembled to identify the alkyl substituent. A careful piecing-together is required to distinguish isomers.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine (-CH-) group directly attached to the ring (benzylic position).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl (-CH₃) group attached to this methine.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` and `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: These signals represent an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which must also be attached to the same benzylic methine group.\n    *   Assembling these fragments confirms the substituent is a **sec-butyl** group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. An isobutyl group, for comparison, would have a different signal pattern (e.g., a 6H doublet).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option C, but it's important to recognize this is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second part of the question involves the chemical transformation of Compound X.\n\n*   **Careful Point - Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Careful Point - Transformation:** Its known function is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point - Selectivity:** This reaction is selective. It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl side chain. No rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group.

This analysis is performed consistently and accurately across all candidate answers.\n\n*   **Key Points from IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a definitive and unambiguous signal for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp C=O stretch is characteristic of a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks confirm the presence of C=C bonds within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Key Points from ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** group, confirming the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinct A₂B₂ pattern is a clear signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) belongs to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Assembly:** The remaining signals define the second substituent. The crucial point is to correctly assemble the fragments: a methine (-CH-) at 2.9 ppm, a methyl (-CH₃) at 1.4 ppm, a methylene (-CH₂-) at 1.7 ppm, and another methyl (-CH₃) at 0.9 ppm. Piecing them together based on their splitting patterns (t, d, m) confirms the structure is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, a **sec-butyl** group. Distinguishing this from an isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`), which would have different signals, is a key point of care.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second part of the question is to determine the outcome of reacting 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with the given reagents.\n\n*   **Key Point on Reagents:** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.

Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of Compound X is determined by a careful interpretation of its Infrared (IR) and ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The extremely broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of C=C double bonds within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data unanimously indicates that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm** is a classic signal for the highly deshielded acidic proton of the **-COOH** group, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The pair of doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** is a signature pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their downfield shift.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Assembling the alkyl group is crucial, and isomers must be distinguished.\n        *   The signal at `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is the most downfield of the alkyl signals, indicating it's a benzylic proton (-CH-) directly attached to the ring.\n        *   A doublet at `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` represents a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to this single methine proton.\n        *   A triplet at `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` represents a methyl group coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   A multiplet at `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` is the methylene group, coupled to both the terminal methyl and the benzylic methine.\n    *   Assembling these pieces confirms the substituent is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl** group. An isobutyl group, for contrast, would show a 6H doublet for its two equivalent methyls.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C) in the question, which is the reactant, not the product.\n\n**2. Predict the Final Product of the Reaction**\n\nThe second step is to determine the outcome of reacting Compound X with the given reagents.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. Its known function is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** This reaction is selective. It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl side chain. No rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n*   **Conclusion for the Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Match the Product to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that corresponds to the predicted final product.\n\n*   **Predicted Product:** **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\nComparing this to the provided list:\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This exactly matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is incorrect. The NMR data clearly shows a sec-butyl group, and the reaction does not cause this type of rearrangement.\n*   **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material, not the final product. It is a common distractor.\n*   **D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure is entirely inconsistent with the spectral data and reaction.\n\nThe final product is unequivocally 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first crucial task is to identify the structure of Compound X by interpreting its Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **Careful Points from IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a highly distinctive and unambiguous signal for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that forms hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp peak characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which provides extra stability and slightly lowers the frequency.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks represent C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring, confirming its presence.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data conclusively identifies Compound X as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Points from ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern is a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group, which deshields them. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Structure Analysis:** The remaining signals are assembled like puzzle pieces to determine the structure of the second substituent.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** The downfield shift suggests this single proton is on the carbon directly attached to the aromatic ring (a benzylic proton). Its multiplicity indicates it has multiple neighbors. It's a methine (-CH-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This doublet represents a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton, which must be the benzylic methine.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This triplet and multiplet combination describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The methylene (-CH₂-) at 1.7 ppm is coupled to both the methyl group and the benzylic methine, explaining its complex multiplet (m) appearance.\n        *   **Assembling the group:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-) attached to a methyl group and an ethyl group. The full substituent is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl** group. An isobutyl group would show a doublet for 6H, which is not observed.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine the product of the reaction with the given reagents.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent system. It is known for its ability to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to its corresponding methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Selectivity:** This reaction is highly effective for reducing carbonyls and carboxylic acids. Crucially, it will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl alkyl group. No rearrangement of the alkyl group will occur under these conditions.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a methyl group.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is a benzene ring substituted in a para fashion with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group. The correct name is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nFinally, we compare the deduced product with the multiple-choice options given in the problem description.\n\n*   **A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** Incorrect. The NMR data clearly indicate a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group. The reaction does not cause this rearrangement.\n*   **B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** Incorrect. This structure is inconsistent with the starting material and the known reaction.\n*   **C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** Correct.

The pair of doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their strong downfield shift.\n    *   **Alkyl Side Chain:** The remaining upfield signals define the other substituent. We assemble it piece by piece:\n        *   The signal at **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** is a methine (-CH-) group directly attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n        *   This benzylic proton is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃), which appears as the **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** doublet.\n        *   It is also adjacent to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The ethyl group's protons give the signal at **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** for the terminal -CH₃ and the signal at **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** for the -CH₂-.\n        *   **Assembling the group:** The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group. It is crucial to distinguish this from its isomer, isobutyl (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`), which would show a 6H doublet for the two equivalent methyls, a pattern not present here.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Final Product**\n\nNow we analyze the chemical reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the Reaction**\n    *   The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent system.\n    *   Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Predicting the Transformation**\n    *   The reaction is selective.

There is unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on this structure.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Carboxylic Acid Functional Group:** The extremely broad signal in the `3400–2500 cm⁻¹` range is a definitive and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The strong, sharp peak at `1720 cm⁻¹` corresponds to the C=O carbonyl stretch, with its frequency confirming conjugation with an aromatic ring. The presence of the aromatic ring itself is confirmed by C=C stretching peaks at `1610 cm⁻¹` and `1450 cm⁻¹`.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Confirmation of Carboxylic Acid:** The broad singlet for one proton (`bs, 1H`) at a very downfield chemical shift of `10.5 ppm` is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a -COOH group, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Substitution Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets (`d`) in the aromatic region, at `8.0 ppm` (2H) and `7.2 ppm` (2H), is a clear signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) belongs to the protons ortho to the highly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Identifying the Alkyl Isomer:** The remaining signals define the second substituent. A careful assembly is required to distinguish between possible butyl isomers.\n        *   The signal at `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is a methine (-CH-) group directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   This methine is coupled to a methyl group (`-CH₃`), which gives the doublet (`d`) at `1.4 ppm` (3H).\n        *   It is also coupled to an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), which is identified by the triplet (`t`) for its terminal methyl at `0.9 ppm` (3H) and the multiplet (`m`) for its methylene at `1.7 ppm` (2H).\n        *   This specific arrangement, `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, is a **sec-butyl** group. It is definitively not an isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`), which would show different signals (e.g., a 6H doublet for the equivalent methyls).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the spectral evidence, the starting material is unequivocally **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to determine the outcome of the reaction of Compound X with the specified reagents.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. Its specific and well-known function is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) directly to a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   **Careful Point 6: Selectivity and Stability:** The reaction is selective for the carboxyl group. The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain are inert under these conditions and will remain unchanged. No skeletal rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Final Product:** The reaction converts the `-COOH` group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into a `-CH₃` group. Therefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that corresponds to the predicted final product.\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This is incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl, as determined by NMR.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This exactly matches the predicted final product.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is incorrect. It is the **starting material**, not the final product, making it a common distractor.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an entirely different molecular structure and is inconsistent with the data.\n\nThe analysis robustly concludes that the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product of the reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first crucial step is to correctly deduce the structure of the starting material from its spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Careful Points from the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad signal spanning **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive and unmistakable characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid where the carbonyl group is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency slightly compared to a saturated acid.\n    *   The signals at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data unequivocally establishes that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Points from the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The broad singlet (bs) at **10.5 ppm** (1H) is a classic signal for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid** group, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The two doublets (d) in the aromatic region at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   The signals in the alkyl region must be pieced together to identify the second substituent. A crucial point is to distinguish between isomers like sec-butyl and isobutyl.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We can identify fragments:\n            1.  An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`): seen from the `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` signal and the `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` signal.\n            2.  A methyl group (`-CH₃`) attached to a methine (`-CH-`): seen from the `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` signal.\n            3.  A benzylic methine (`-CH-`): This is the proton at `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, which is attached to the ring, the methyl group from fragment #2, and the ethyl group from fragment #1.\n        *   Connecting these pieces gives the substituent `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to determine the outcome when 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reacted with the given reagents.\n\n*   **Careful Point on Reagents:** The reagents are **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Careful Point on Transformation:** This reagent's primary function in this context is the complete and exhaustive reduction of a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) directly to a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   **Careful Point on Selectivity:** This powerful reduction is selective for the carboxyl group in this molecule. It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl side chain. Importantly, no skeletal rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs under these conditions.\n*   **Conclusion on Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group.

All provided candidate answers correctly perform this analysis, and their reasoning is sound.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of Compound X is determined by a careful, combined analysis of its Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum - Careful Points:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive and unmistakable feature. This signal corresponds to the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is typical for a carboxylic acid where the carbonyl is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of C=C bond stretching within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR**: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum - Careful Points:**\n    *   The broad singlet at **10.5 ppm (1H)**, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The pair of doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** is a tell-tale signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their strong downfield shift.\n    *   The remaining signals must be assembled to identify the alkyl substituent. A careful piecing-together is required to distinguish isomers.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A methine (-CH-) group directly attached to the ring (benzylic position).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl (-CH₃) group attached to this methine.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` and `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: These signals represent an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which must also be attached to the same benzylic methine group.\n    *   Assembling these fragments confirms the substituent is a **sec-butyl** group: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. An isobutyl group, for comparison, would have a different signal pattern (e.g., a 6H doublet).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option C, but it's important to recognize this is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second part of the question involves the chemical transformation of Compound X.\n\n*   **Careful Point - Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Careful Point - Transformation:** Its known function is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point - Selectivity:** This reaction is selective. It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl side chain. No rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product with the Provided Options**\n\nFinally, the predicted product, **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, is matched with the given choices:\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl isomer. The reaction does not cause this rearrangement.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, a common distractor.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This exactly matches the predicted final product.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis of the spectral data and the chemical reaction consistently leads to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe initial step is to correctly identify the structure of Compound X by interpreting its Infrared (IR) and ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.

The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) belongs to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Assembly:** The remaining signals define the second substituent. The crucial point is to correctly assemble the fragments: a methine (-CH-) at 2.9 ppm, a methyl (-CH₃) at 1.4 ppm, a methylene (-CH₂-) at 1.7 ppm, and another methyl (-CH₃) at 0.9 ppm. Piecing them together based on their splitting patterns (t, d, m) confirms the structure is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, a **sec-butyl** group. Distinguishing this from an isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`), which would have different signals, is a key point of care.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second part of the question is to determine the outcome of reacting 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with the given reagents.\n\n*   **Key Point on Reagents:** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.

It does not stop at the alcohol or aldehyde stage.\n*   **Key Point on Selectivity:** The reaction is selective for the carboxyl group. The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain will remain unchanged. No rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs under these conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that corresponds to the predicted product.\n\n*   **A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, not the final product. It is a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This has the incorrect alkyl isomer.

We assemble it piece by piece:\n        *   The signal at **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** is a methine (-CH-) group directly attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n        *   This benzylic proton is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃), which appears as the **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** doublet.\n        *   It is also adjacent to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The ethyl group's protons give the signal at **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** for the terminal -CH₃ and the signal at **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** for the -CH₂-.\n        *   **Assembling the group:** The substituent is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group. It is crucial to distinguish this from its isomer, isobutyl (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`), which would show a 6H doublet for the two equivalent methyls, a pattern not present here.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Final Product**\n\nNow we analyze the chemical reaction.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identifying the Reaction**\n    *   The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent system.\n    *   Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Predicting the Transformation**\n    *   The reaction is selective. The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain will remain unchanged. The reaction does not cause rearrangements of the alkyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that matches the predicted product.\n\n*   The predicted final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This name and structure exactly match the final product.\n    *   **B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the starting material. It is a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n    *   **C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This is an incorrect structure.\n    *   **D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data clearly defined a sec-butyl group, which is retained in the reaction.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis confirms that the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a multi-step problem that requires careful analysis of spectroscopic data to determine a starting material, followed by predicting the outcome of a chemical reaction.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first step is to deduce the structure of Compound X from its IR and ¹H NMR spectra. All candidate answers correctly identify the structure through a similar process.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The extremely broad signal at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is the most definitive feature. It is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n    *   The signals at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of C=C bond stretching within an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR**: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: This broad singlet, very far downfield, confirms the acidic proton of the **-COOH group**.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: This distinct pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the unmistakable signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (shifted downfield) because they are adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis**: The remaining signals are pieced together to identify the second substituent.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: This signal is for a single proton attached directly to the benzene ring (benzylic position). It's a methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the methine proton.\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` and `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: This triplet/multiplet pair describes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which is also attached to the same benzylic methine proton.\n    *   **Assembling the Substituent**: The group attached to the ring is a methine carbon bonded to a methyl group and an ethyl group: **-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)**, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X**: The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to determine what happens when 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid reacts with the given reagents.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reagents and Transformation**\n    *   The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Its specific function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a **methyl group (-CH₃)**.\n    *   The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain are unreactive under these conditions. No rearrangement occurs.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Final Product**: The -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a -CH₃ group. The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**3. Match the Final Product to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that correctly identifies the product.\n\n*   **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect structure.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data clearly show a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n*   **C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This name and structure exactly match the predicted final product.\n*   **D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Incorrect. This is the **starting material**, not the final product. It is a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n\nThe logical flow from spectral interpretation to reaction prediction consistently leads to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the spectroscopic data and the chemical reaction, here is a step-by-step determination of the final product, highlighting the careful points in the reasoning process.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first crucial task is to deduce the structure of the reactant from its IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Carboxylic Acid O-H Stretch.** The extremely broad signal in the region of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is the most definitive feature. It is a textbook signature for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Carbonyl Stretch.** The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) group. Its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring, which provides stability and slightly lowers the vibrational frequency compared to a non-conjugated acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum provides unequivocal evidence that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**:\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Carboxylic Acid Proton.** The broad singlet (`bs`) at **10.5 ppm** integrating to one proton (1H) is a classic signal for the highly deshielded acidic proton of the -COOH group, which confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Benzene Ring Substitution Pattern.** The pattern of two doublets (`d`) in the aromatic region, one at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and another at **7.2 ppm (2H)**, is a clear signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* (adjacent) to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Careful Point 5: Alkyl Group Isomer Identification.** The remaining signals must be pieced together to determine the exact structure of the alkyl substituent, distinguishing between isomers like sec-butyl and isobutyl.\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: The chemical shift and integration (1H) indicate a single proton directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton). Its multiplet (`m`) nature and uniqueness confirm it is a methine (-CH-) group, ruling out an isobutyl group (which has a benzylic -CH₂- group).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for three protons represents a methyl (-CH₃) group attached to the benzylic methine (-CH-).\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` and `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A triplet for three protons and a multiplet for two protons describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which must also be attached to the benzylic methine.\n        *   **Assembling the group:** The substituent is **-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)**, a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D), but this is the starting material, a common distractor.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\n*   **Careful Point 6: Reagent Functionality.** The reaction is performed with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Reaction Selectivity and Outcome.** The primary function of Red P / HI in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) directly to a methyl group (-CH₃). The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are unreactive under these conditions. No skeletal rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n*   **Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nWe now compare the predicted product, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, with the given choices.\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This exactly matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is incorrect.

There is unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on this structure.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Carboxylic Acid Functional Group:** The extremely broad signal in the `3400–2500 cm⁻¹` range is a definitive and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The strong, sharp peak at `1720 cm⁻¹` corresponds to the C=O carbonyl stretch, with its frequency confirming conjugation with an aromatic ring.
