The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nC) The compound is contaminated with a precursor\nD) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided experimental evidence.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\nThis is the most definitive piece of information and the logical starting point for the analysis.\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS experiment separates the crude compound into two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). However, the mass spectrum (MS) for **both** of these peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected molecule.\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** This proves that the two components in the mixture are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight but have a different spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination of Options:** This single fact immediately rules out any explanation that involves impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** Incorrect. A precursor would be an unreacted starting material or an intermediate. It would have a different, usually lower, molecular weight.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Incorrect. This side reaction would add an extra molecular group to the peptide, resulting in a product with a different, higher, molecular weight.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data**\nAfter Step 1, we have eliminated options A and D. We are left with the two remaining possibilities, which are both types of isomers: enantiomers (B) and diastereoisomers (C). We must use the LC and NMR data to distinguish between them.\n*   **Observation 1:** The crude compound gives two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram.\n*   **Observation 2:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** Standard liquid chromatography and standard NMR are achiral techniques. For two species to be separated by an achiral LC column and distinguished by a standard NMR spectrometer, they must have **different physical and chemical properties**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options**\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. In a standard (achiral) environment, they possess **identical** physical and chemical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point, NMR spectrum).\n    *   Therefore, they would **not** separate on a standard LC column and would be **indistinguishable** in a standard NMR spectrum. They would appear as a single peak in both experiments. This is in direct contradiction to the observations.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in molecules with multiple stereocenters, like peptides, where a synthesis step might partially invert the stereochemistry at one (but not all) of the chiral centers (a process called epimerization). Another possibility is the presence of stable cis/trans isomers about an amide bond (these are called rotamers, which are a class of diastereomer).\n    *   Crucially, because diastereoisomers are not mirror images, they have **different** physical and chemical properties. This perfectly explains all the experimental data:\n        1.  As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n        2.  Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, explaining the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        3.

This is in direct contradiction to the experimental data.\n\n*   **Careful Point 7 (Evaluating Diastereoisomers):** Let's consider Option B, a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n    *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in molecules with multiple chiral centers, like the peptidic compound in question, and can arise from the partial inversion of a single chiral center during synthesis (a process called epimerization) or from stable *cis/trans* isomers around a peptide bond (rotamers), which are a class of diastereomer.\n    *   **Key Property:** Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **Result:** This difference in properties perfectly explains all the experimental observations:\n        1.  As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n        2.  Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, explaining the two peaks.\n        3.  Their different chemical structures and 3D shapes create distinct chemical environments for their protons, leading to different signals in the NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe combination of all experimental evidence—observing two species that are isomers (same mass) but can be separated by standard chromatography and distinguished by standard NMR—provides the classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"

A key characteristic is that they have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n    *   Because their properties are identical in this context, they **cannot be separated by a standard LC column** (they would elute as a single peak) and are **indistinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer** (they would produce a single, identical set of signals).\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to both the LC and NMR observations. Therefore, Option (B) is incorrect.\n\n*   **(C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. In peptide synthesis, this can commonly arise from partial epimerization (the inversion of one of several chiral centers) or from the presence of stable cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (these are called rotamers, which are a class of diastereomer).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This difference in properties perfectly explains all the experimental observations:\n        1.  Their status as isomers is consistent with the MS data (same mass).\n        2.  Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by LC (two LC peaks).\n        3.  Their different chemical environments mean their corresponding protons have different magnetic resonances, leading to distinct NMR spectra (two NMR peaks).\n    *   Therefore, this is the only explanation consistent with all the evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
