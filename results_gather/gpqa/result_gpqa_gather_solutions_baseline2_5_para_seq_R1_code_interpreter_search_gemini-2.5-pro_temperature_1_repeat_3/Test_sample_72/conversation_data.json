The unanimous numerical results are a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total energy of approximately **5.96 mc²**. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, etc.) across the various answers is a result of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. The correct approach is to perform an independent, step-by-step calculation and match the results to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem has two distinct parts: calculating the relative speed and calculating the total energy of the system.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nBecause the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light, *c*), the classical formula for subtracting velocities is not valid. The relativistic velocity subtraction formula must be used.\n\n*   **Formula:** For two objects with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ moving in the same direction, their relative speed is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\n*   **Result (Relative Speed):** When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts, as measured from a stationary frame of reference.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. The system's total energy is the sum of the individual energies: $E_{system} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m; Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy ($E_1$) = $\\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m; Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy ($E_2$) = $\\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Result (Total Energy):** When rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Velocity:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This is incorrect and ignores the effects of special relativity. This incorrect speed appears in option B.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** Another potential error is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system by summing the masses: $(2m + 3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$. This neglects the considerable kinetic energy the astronauts have and leads to an incorrect answer. This incorrect energy appears in option A.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system must be found by summing the energies of the individual components ($E_1 + E_2$). Each component's energy must be calculated with its own unique mass and Lorentz factor before summation. One cannot simply combine the masses or use the relative velocity in the energy formula.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe independent, rigorous analysis yields the following pair of values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$): 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy (E): 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the problem requires breaking it down into two separate calculations, both of which must use formulas from Einstein's special theory of relativity due to the high speeds involved.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction. Simply subtracting the speeds classically would give an incorrect answer.\n\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative speed is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result:** When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the two individual astronauts. Each astronaut's energy includes both their rest energy and their kinetic energy.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. The total energy of the system is $E_{system} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy Calculation:**\n    *   $E_{system} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result:** When rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Use Relativistic Velocity Subtraction:** A common mistake is to use classical subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This is incorrect and corresponds to the velocity in option D. The relativistic formula must be used.\n2.  **Use Total Energy, Not Rest Energy:** The question asks for total energy, not just rest energy. Another common error is to calculate only the system's total rest energy: $(2m + 3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$. This neglects the kinetic energy from their motion and incorrectly matches the energy value in option B.\n3.  **Sum Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies ($E_1 + E_2$), each calculated with its own mass and Lorentz factor. One cannot sum the masses and then use an average or relative velocity in the energy formula.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous calculations yield the following pair of values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$): 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$): 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   **A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   D) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values exactly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe output from the Python code confirms the results of the step-by-step analysis.\n\n### **Summary of Verified Calculations**\n\n1.  **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):** The code output `Relative speed factor: 0.143` confirms that the relative speed is approximately 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places.\n2.  **Total Energy ($E$):** The code output `Total energy factor: 5.964` confirms that the total energy of the system is approximately 5.96 mc² when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe independently calculated and code-verified values are:\n*   **Relative Speed ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nWe now compare this result to the list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated pair of values perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis using the principles of special relativity. Based on the provided candidate answers and an independent verification, the correct method and numerical results are consistently determined across all agents. The final choice depends on matching the correct results to the specific option list in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem has two distinct parts:\n1.  Calculate the relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n2.  Calculate the total energy ($E$) of the system.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, their relative speed cannot be found by simple subtraction. The relativistic velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction must be used.\n\n*   **Formula:** $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Given:** $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result (Relative Speed):** When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of each astronaut.

This value neglects the additional kinetic energy from the astronauts' motion.

The final task is to perform this calculation and match it to the specific options given in the question.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-step Calculation**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction.\n\n*   **Formula:** For two objects with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ moving in the same direction, their relative speed is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\n*   **Result (Relative Speed):** When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. The system's total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m; Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m; Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy Calculation ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Result (Total Energy):** When rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n---\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Velocity:** It is a common mistake to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores the effects of relativity and would incorrectly lead to the velocity value in option D.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** Another common mistake is to calculate only the total *rest energy* of the system by summing the rest masses: $E = (m_1 + m_2)c^2 = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$. This neglects the kinetic energy from their motion and incorrectly matches the energy value in option B.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of its individual components. Each particle's energy must be calculated with its own unique mass and Lorentz factor before being summed.\n4.  **Matching Both Values:** It is essential to find the option that correctly matches *both* the calculated relative speed and the total energy. For instance, option B has the correct speed but the wrong energy.\n\n---\n### **Conclusion**\nThe independent and rigorous calculations yield:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$): 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$): 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this pair of values to the provided options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) **v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated results perfectly match the values in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics principles and the numerical results of the calculations. All agents who detailed their work arrived at a relative speed of approximately 0.14c and a total energy of approximately 5.96 mc². The variation in the final lettered choices (A, B, C, D) indicates that the agents were likely presented with randomized or different lists of options. Therefore, the most reliable approach is to perform an independent, step-by-step verification of the calculations and then match the results to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem has two distinct parts that must be solved using the principles of special relativity.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction, as classical mechanics is inaccurate at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula**: For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative speed is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result (Relative Speed)**: When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two non-interacting astronauts.\n\n*   **Formula**: The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. The system's total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m; Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m; Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result (Total Energy)**: When rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Velocity:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores relativistic effects and would incorrectly lead to option C. The correct relativistic formula must be used.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** Another frequent error is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system by summing the rest masses: $E = (m_1 + m_2)c^2 = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$. This neglects the significant kinetic energy the astronauts have and would incorrectly lead to option A.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies calculated for each particle *individually*. Each component has its own mass and velocity, and thus its own unique Lorentz factor. It is incorrect to combine masses and use an average velocity or the relative velocity in the energy calculation.\n4.  **Matching to Options:** The final, crucial step is to carefully match the calculated pair of values ($v_{rel} = 0.14c$, $E = 5.96 mc^2$) to the options given in this specific problem statement.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous, step-by-step analysis yields the following values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this pair of results with the provided options:\n\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values exactly match those in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the physics principles involved leads to the following step-by-step solution.\n\nThe problem requires two calculations using formulas from Einstein's special theory of relativity: the relative speed between the astronauts and the total energy of the two-astronaut system.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative speed is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\n*   **Result (Relative Speed):** When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts as measured from a stationary reference frame.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

This ignores the effects of relativity and would lead to an incorrect speed, such as in option D. The relativistic formula must be used.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** The question asks for the *total* energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), which includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. Another common mistake is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system, which would be $(2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$.

Calculate the relative speed ($v_{rel}$) of the two astronauts.\n2.  Calculate the total energy ($E$) of the two-astronaut system.\n\nBoth calculations require formulas from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, their relative speed cannot be found by simple subtraction. The relativistic velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction must be used.\n\n*   **Formula**:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Given**: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n    $v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\n*   **Result (Relative Speed)**: When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts. A particle's total energy includes both its rest energy and its kinetic energy.\n\n*   **Formula**: The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is its rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. The system's total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m; Speed ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m; Speed ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Result (Total Energy)**: When rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Velocity:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores relativistic effects and would lead to the incorrect velocity listed in option A.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** The question asks for the *total energy* ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), which includes kinetic energy. A frequent error is to calculate only the total *rest energy* of the system ($E_{rest} = (m_1+m_2)c^2 = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$). This incorrect value appears as the energy in option C.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies calculated for each astronaut individually. One cannot sum the masses and then use an average velocity or the relative velocity in the energy formula, as the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is a non-linear function of speed and is unique to each astronaut.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe correct, verified calculations yield the following pair of values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$): 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$): 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires us to calculate two quantities using principles from Einstein's special theory of relativity: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the two-astronaut system.

All agents who detailed their work arrived at a relative speed of approximately 0.14c and a total energy of approximately 5.96 mc². The variation in the final lettered choices (A, B, C, D) indicates that the agents were likely presented with randomized or different lists of options. Therefore, the most reliable approach is to perform an independent, step-by-step verification of the calculations and then match the results to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem has two distinct parts that must be solved using the principles of special relativity.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction, as classical mechanics is inaccurate at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula**: For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative speed is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result (Relative Speed)**: When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two non-interacting astronauts.\n\n*   **Formula**: The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. The system's total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m; Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m; Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result (Total Energy)**: When rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Velocity:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores relativistic effects and would incorrectly lead to option C. The correct relativistic formula must be used.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** Another frequent error is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system by summing the rest masses: $E = (m_1 + m_2)c^2 = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$. This neglects the significant kinetic energy the astronauts have and would incorrectly lead to option A.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies calculated for each particle *individually*. Each component has its own mass and velocity, and thus its own unique Lorentz factor. It is incorrect to combine masses and use an average velocity or the relative velocity in the energy calculation.\n4.  **Matching to Options:** The final, crucial step is to carefully match the calculated pair of values ($v_{rel} = 0.14c$, $E = 5.96 mc^2$) to the options given in this specific problem statement.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous, step-by-step analysis yields the following values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this pair of results with the provided options:\n\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values exactly match those in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the physics principles involved leads to the following step-by-step solution.\n\nThe problem requires two calculations using formulas from Einstein's special theory of relativity: the relative speed between the astronauts and the total energy of the two-astronaut system.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative speed is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    *   $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\n*   **Result (Relative Speed):** When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts as measured from a stationary reference frame.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ and velocity $v$ is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

This ignores the effects of relativity and would lead to an incorrect speed, such as in option D. The relativistic formula must be used.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** The question asks for the *total* energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), which includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. Another common mistake is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system, which would be $(2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$.

The system's total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m; Speed ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m; Speed ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Result (Total Energy)**: When rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Velocity:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores relativistic effects and would lead to the incorrect velocity listed in option A.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** The question asks for the *total energy* ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), which includes kinetic energy. A frequent error is to calculate only the total *rest energy* of the system ($E_{rest} = (m_1+m_2)c^2 = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$). This incorrect value appears as the energy in option C.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies calculated for each astronaut individually. One cannot sum the masses and then use an average velocity or the relative velocity in the energy formula, as the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is a non-linear function of speed and is unique to each astronaut.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe correct, verified calculations yield the following pair of values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$): 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$): 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires us to calculate two quantities using principles from Einstein's special theory of relativity: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the two-astronaut system.

The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = $2m$; Velocity ($v_1$) = $0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy ($E_1$) = $\\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = $3m$; Velocity ($v_2$) = $0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy ($E_2$) = $\\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Velocity:** It is a common error to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores the effects of special relativity and would incorrectly lead to option C.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** Another frequent mistake is to calculate only the total rest energy of the system by summing the masses ($E = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$). This neglects the significant kinetic energy from their motion and would incorrectly lead to option A.\n3.  **Summation of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system must be the sum of the individual energies ($E_1 + E_2$), each calculated with its own specific mass and Lorentz factor. It is incorrect to sum the masses first and then apply an energy formula with some average or relative velocity.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe independently verified calculations yield the following values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this pair of results to the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values exactly match those in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating a synthesis of the correct reasoning found in the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires us to find two quantities for a system of astronauts moving at relativistic speeds: their relative speed ($v_{rel}$) and the total energy ($E$) of the system. An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals that while the agents reached different final letter choices, their underlying physics calculations are overwhelmingly consistent and correct. This indicates they were working with shuffled multiple-choice options. The most reliable method is to perform the calculation independently and match the result to the definitive list of options provided in the question.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula**: For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, the relative speed $v_{rel}$ is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    Given $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\n*   **Result (Relative Speed)**: When rounded to two decimal places, **$v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts.
