Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using integer masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428` (which is very close to 1/7).\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. In catalysis, this often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to a more saturated and a less saturated (often aromatic) compound.\n    *   A plausible second component for Y would be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would convert benzene to cyclohexane (`C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂`), and cyclohexane would not react. The final product would be only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that react to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is reduced to cyclohexane and the other is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. The products have 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the two molecules of mixture X must also have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The logical precursors to cyclohexane and benzene with a C₆ ring are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so we must use **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The other component must be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**.\n    *   Let's check if these two components fit the conditions.\n        *   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)\n        *   X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Neither has conjugated double bonds.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (cyclohexene + 1,4-cyclohexadiene) would yield only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    *   So, **mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula simplifies to `y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428`.\n*   This gives `y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)`, which simplifies to `0.8572y ≈ 1.7136x`, or `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   The empirical formula is CH₂, and the molecular formula is (CH₂)n or CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane (CnH2n) is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given data.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Mixture X, which is unsaturated, is converted to the saturated/aromatic mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. This points towards a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. A well-known example is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   For a C₆ system, a cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene would disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. So, mixture Y fits this description.\n    *   Upon hydrogenation, cyclohexane does not react, while benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). Thus, hydrogenating mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We have established the reaction that forms Y: `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`, where A and B are the equimolar components of mixture X.\n*   By balancing the atoms, the sum of the formulas of A and B must be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and both get hydrogenated to the same C₆ skeleton (cyclohexane), they must both be C₆ hydrocarbons, let's say C₆Hx and C₆Hy.\n*   Therefore, x + y = 18.\n*   The properties of mixture X are:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both A and B yields only cyclohexane (Z). This confirms they must have a six-membered ring structure.\n*   Let's find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic isomers that fit the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** is a prime candidate. It has one double bond and would decolorize bromine water. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   To satisfy x + y = 18, if A is C₆H₁₀, then B must be C₆H₈.\n    *   We need a non-conjugated C₆H₈ isomer with a six-membered ring. **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits this description perfectly. Its two double bonds are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. It also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The other common isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mix of cyclohexene (A = C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (B = C₆H₈).\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the monoene is reduced to the alkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of Z**: We'll use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to find the empirical and molecular formula of the hydrocarbon Z. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be an alkane or a cycloalkane. The mass fraction strongly suggests a CnH2n formula, characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Z and Mixture Y**: Based on the chemical properties described (common solvent, product of hydrogenation, part of a disproportionation reaction), we can deduce the specific structure of Z. The properties of mixture Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to Z) allow us to identify its two components, one of which is Z. The most plausible scenario involves a C6 carbon skeleton, making Z cyclohexane and the other component of Y benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, specifically a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is dehydrogenated to form benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**: By setting up a hydrogen balance for the disproportionation reaction, we can create an equation relating the number of hydrogen atoms in the two components of mixture X. Solving this equation will give the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following a logical deduction based on the provided information.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.\n    # Z is a hydrocarbon (CnHm) with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    # Mass fraction H = (mass of H) / (total mass)\n    # Using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1:\n    # 0.1428 is approximately 1/7.\n    # For a formula CnHm, the mass fraction of H is m / (12n + m).\n    # m / (12n + m) = 1/7  => 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.\n    # The formula for Z is CnH2n.

Since the empirical formula is CH2, the molecular formula must be of the form CnH2n. This indicates that Z is a cycloalkane.\nLet's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016n / 14.027n ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). So, Z is indeed a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify hydrocarbon Z and mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have a carbon skeleton that can be converted to the skeleton of Z upon hydrogenation. If Z is cyclohexane, all components must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as one of its components. Let Y = {Z, W}.\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and W must be saturated compounds (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (no reaction), and hydrogenation of W must also give Z.\n*   This leads to a crucial point. If W is a saturated cycloalkane isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation to Z would involve skeletal rearrangement, which is possible under \"severe conditions\". However, let's consider the disproportionation reaction first.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the disproportionation reaction and identify mixture X.**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y. This is a disproportionation.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. Let the two components of the equimolar mixture Y be Z and W.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Z + W (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   We know Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). So, one product is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means W must also not react with bromine water. A highly unsaturated but stable aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6) fits this description. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis: Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already saturated. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12). So, hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the condition.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. This fits.\n*   Now we can deduce A and B from the reaction: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   The total atoms on the product side are C12H18. This must be the same for the reactants A + B.\n    *   A and B are in an equimolar mixture, and their hydrogenation both yield cyclohexane. This means A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's find two C6 cyclic alkenes, A and B, that sum to C12H18. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total formula is C10H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n    *   The problem specifies no conjugated bonds. 1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated. Therefore, the diene must be 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n*   So, let's finalize the identities:\n    *   **Mixture X** = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n    *   **Mixture Y** = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   **Substance Z** = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n\n**Step 4: Verify all conditions.**\n*   **X**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H10, C6H8). Decolorizes Br2 water (due to C=C). No conjugated bonds (1,4-diene is not conjugated). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Reaction**: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) yielding an equimolar mixture Y. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Y**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H12, C6H6). Does not decolorize Br2 water (cyclohexane is saturated, benzene is unreactive). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 + H2 → C6H12. C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H12 → C6H12. C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Z**: C6H12, a hydrocarbon solvent, H% is 14.28%, constituent of Y. **(Checks out)**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass)\n\nThe value 14.28% is equivalent to the decimal 0.1428. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's assume the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass is 1/7. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity:\n1/7 = (y × 1) / (x × 12 + y × 1)\n12x + y = 7y\n12x = 6y\ny/x = 2/1\n\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH2. The general molecular formula is therefore (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\nZ is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is cyclohexane, C6H12.\nThis fits all the descriptions, so we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's call the two components of Y, C and D. So, C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\nMixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Cyclohexane (C) is saturated and does not react. Therefore, the other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water. This suggests D is either a saturated compound or an aromatic compound (which does not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\nHydrogenation(C + D) → Z only\nHydrogenation(cyclohexane + D) → cyclohexane only\nSince cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. This means that the hydrogenation of D must yield cyclohexane.\nSo, D must be a C6 hydrocarbon that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Given that D does not decolorize bromine water, the most plausible candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under standard test conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\nTherefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction, which means one component is oxidized while the other is reduced.\nA + B → C + D\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X loses hydrogen to form benzene (oxidation), and the other component gains hydrogen to form cyclohexane (reduction).\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved.\nTotal C atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 6 (from cyclohexane) = 12.\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\nTherefore, the two molecules A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe are also told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons, and their carbon skeletons can be hydrogenated to a six-membered ring. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\nFrom the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\nWe have several constraints for A and B:\n1.  Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water,\" so at least one component must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This means their hydrogen counts must be less than that of the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (C6H12). So, x < 12 and y < 12.\n2.  \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n\nWe need to find two different integers, x and y, that satisfy x + y = 18, with both x < 12 and y < 12. Since stable hydrocarbons typically have an even number of hydrogen atoms, we look for a pair of even integers. The only pair that fits these conditions is **8 and 10**.\nSo, the components of mixture X have the formulas C6H8 and C6H10.\n\nLet's identify the specific structures:\n*   **C6H10**: This must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This fits all conditions.\n*   **C6H8**: This must be a cyclohexadiene. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This also fits all conditions.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components.\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n```python\n# This code performs the final addition based on the derived molecular formulas.\n# The first liquid in mixture X is cyclohexene, C6H10.\n# The second liquid in mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8.\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 = 10\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2 = 8\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 + hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 18\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen is approximately 14.28%, which is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   If Z were an alkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n*   If Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given value of 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that:\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two components of Y be C and D. We can set C = Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). For the hydrogenation of Y to yield only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also be converted into cyclohexane.\n\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen). Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully reduced C₆ ring, the other product (D) is likely the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\nLet's check if this composition for Y fits the description:\n*   **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}**\n*   **Does not decolorize bromine water**: Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Hydrogenation gives only Z**: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). This is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction and Mixture X\n\nThe transformation of mixture X into mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction can be written as:\n\n**Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (Mixture Y)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. Both components of X must have a C₆ carbon skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to a C₆ product (cyclohexane). Let the formulas of the two components of X be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n\nThe hydrogen balance is:\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component, which is 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Properties of Mixture X\n\nWe can further validate this by identifying plausible structures for the components of X.\n*   They must be unsaturated C₆ compounds to decolorize bromine water.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₑ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ must be a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\nA plausible scenario is the transfer of two hydrogen atoms:\n*   C₆H₁₀ + 2H → C₆H₁₂ (Reduction)\n*   C₆H₈ - 2H → C₆H₆ (Oxidation/Dehydrogenation)\n\nThis implies that mixture X is composed of a C₆H₁₀ isomer and a C₆H₈ isomer.\n*   **C₆H₁₀**: **Cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, decolorizes bromine water, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. It does not have conjugated bonds.\n*   **C₆H₈**: A cyclohexadiene. To meet the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, this must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene. 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation of cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene over a platinum catalyst to yield cyclohexane and benzene is a known type of reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nThus, a mixture X composed of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all the conditions described in the problem. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the provided chemical problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Determine the formula type**: The mass percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a general cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given data.\n    *   For a general alkane with the formula CnH2n+2, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 1/7 leads to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n3.  **Conclusion for Z**: Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also mentions it is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Properties of Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Components of Y**: One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n3.  **Hydrogenation of Y**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components of Y must have the same carbon skeleton. The other component must be a C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n4.  **Identify the second component**: Since the second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is likely aromatic. Benzene (C6H6) is the aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction\n\n1.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n2.  **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both components of X are C6 cyclic compounds.\n3.  **The Reaction (X → Y)**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Let the two components of X be A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n4.  **Conservation of Atoms**: Since the reaction is a 1:1 transformation of an equimolar mixture, we can balance the atoms. Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n    *   Carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 → 6+6).\n    *   Hydrogen atoms must also be balanced: x + y = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structures of Components in X and Calculate the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify possible structures**: The components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons without conjugated bonds. The most common examples are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n2.  **Check for non-conjugated bonds**:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond, so there is no conjugation. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) exists as two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  **Solve for components**: We need two molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n4.  **Verify the reaction**: The proposed reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Such disproportionation and hydrogen transfer reactions over platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon formed from the hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, and it does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let the formula for Z be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is equivalent to 1/7.\n*   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n*   `7m = 12n + m`\n*   `6m = 12n`\n*   `m = 2n`\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all constituent compounds in both mixtures are composed of a six-carbon atom ring structure.\n*   **Mixture Y:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated. One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components of Y, C and D. So, D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12). The other component, C, must also be saturated and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A well-known substance that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Under severe conditions (high pressure and temperature), it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and one component is Z. This fits the description.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n*   Let the components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   This reaction must be balanced in terms of atoms. The products have a total of 12 carbon atoms (6+6) and 18 hydrogen atoms (6+12). Therefore, the reactants A and B must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since all compounds have a C6 skeleton, A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   **Properties of Mixture X:**\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's consider the hydrogen transfer. To form benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12), one reactant must donate hydrogen and the other must accept it. A plausible scenario involves cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let's identify A and B. A logical candidate for the hydrogen acceptor is cyclohexene (C6H10). A logical candidate for the hydrogen donor is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The reaction would be: Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   Carbons: 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   Hydrogens: 8 + 10 = 18 on the left; 6 + 12 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   This reaction is a known type of disproportionation called Zelinsky-Kazansky catalysis, where a hydrogen donor (like a diene) and a hydrogen acceptor (like an alkene) react over a platinum catalyst to yield more stable products (an aromatic compound and an alkane).\n*   Now let's check if these components for X fit all conditions:\n    *   **A = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** It is unsaturated. The double bonds are not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   **B = Cyclohexene (C6H10):** It is unsaturated. It has only one double bond, so no conjugation. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture X = {1,4-Cyclohexadiene, Cyclohexene}. This fits all the given conditions.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass is `12n + m` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value, 14.28%, is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, so `6m ≈ 12n`, which simplifies to `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y, let's call it Y2, must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene/alkyne. For it to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n), Y2 is most likely an aromatic hydrocarbon. The hydrogenation of an aromatic ring requires severe conditions, which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic hydrocarbons are based on a benzene ring. Let's assume the simplest case, where the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring (n=6).\n    *   This makes Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound Y2 would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. Both are liquids and neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form an equimolar mixture of Y = (cyclohexane, benzene).\n    *   The overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. To balance the atoms, the total formula of the reactants must be C12H18. Since X is an equimolar mixture, each molecule on average has the formula C6H9.\n    *   Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Since the mixture is equimolar, the average number of hydrogen atoms is `(a + b) / 2 = 9`, which means `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated. They must also have a C6 ring skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's look for possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond (non-conjugated). `a = 10`.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds. `b = 8`. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check if these two compounds fit the condition `a + b = 18`.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. Yes, they fit perfectly.\n    *   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Process:**\n    *   **X**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   **Reaction**: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). The reaction produces an equimolar mixture of products.\n    *   **Y**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are \"saturated\" towards bromine water.\n    *   **Z**: Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a component of Y, a common solvent, and fits the mass percentage of hydrogen.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: `C6H10 + H2 -> C6H12` and `C6H8 + 2H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y**: `C6H12 -> C6H12` and `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass Fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n*   This can be rearranged to `m / (12n) ≈ 0.1428 / (1 - 0.1428) = 0.1428 / 0.8572 ≈ 1/6`.\n*   So, `m / n ≈ 12 / 6 = 2`. The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and Identify Z**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Z`: Since C=Z and Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This is consistent.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`: D must be converted to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene or alkyne. The two main possibilities are:\n        1.  D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane if Z is cyclohexane). These can isomerize to the more stable Z under severe hydrogenation conditions.\n        2.  D is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to Z (e.g., benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. This is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) is converted to Mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n*   The simplest stoichiometric representation of this is: `A + B -> C + D`.\n*   Let's consider the two possibilities for D identified in Step 2, assuming the most common cycloalkane solvent, cyclohexane (C6H12), as Z.\n    *   **Case 1**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is a saturated isomer, also C6H12.\n        The reaction would be `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H12`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, if A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then `x + y = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n        However, A and B are components of mixture X, which decolorizes bromine water, so they must be unsaturated. They also hydrogenate to form Z (cyclohexane), so they must be C6 compounds. The most hydrogen-rich unsaturated C6 cyclic compound is cyclohexene (C6H10). If both A and B were cyclohexene (which is not possible as they are different liquids), the total hydrogen count would be 10 + 10 = 20. For any other pair of different unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, the sum will be less than 20. Therefore, `x + y = 24` is impossible. This case is ruled out.\n    *   **Case 2**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is its aromatic counterpart, Benzene (C6H6).\n        This fits the properties of Y: {cyclohexane, benzene} is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and upon severe hydrogenation, both yield cyclohexane. Z (cyclohexane) is a component.\n        The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`. This is a plausible outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We need to find two different liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy), that satisfy the following conditions:\n    1.  `x + y = 18`.\n    2.  Both A and B are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n    3.  Hydrogenation of both A and B yields cyclohexane (Z). This implies they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    4.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n*   Let's list the possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). Here, x = 10.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Here, x = 8. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's see if we can form a pair from these that sums to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), then `10 + y = 18`, which gives `y = 8`.\n    *   This means B must be C6H8. The non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n*   So, the mixture X consists of A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). This pair fits all the conditions of the problem. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the alkene: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Number of H atoms in A (Cyclohexene, C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in B (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the general formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molar mass of compound) * 100%\nMass % H = (m × Ar(H)) / (n × Ar(C) + m × Ar(H)) * 100%\n\nUsing the approximate atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12, we can set up the equation. The value 14.28% is a well-known fraction: 14.28% ≈ 100/7 % = 1/7.\nSo, we can write:\nm / (12n + m) = 1/7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\n\nThis gives the general formula for Z as CnH2n. The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y and the disproportionation reaction.**\nMixture Y is formed by heating mixture X with platinum, which causes a disproportionation. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that Z is one of the components of Y.\nSo, one component of Y is a cycloalkane (Z, with formula CnH2n). For the mixture to not decolorize bromine water, the other component must also be saturated or aromatic.\n\nThe reaction type (heating with a platinum catalyst leading to disproportionation) is characteristic of catalytic hydrogen transfer, often called Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. In this reaction, an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\nTherefore, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic compound.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the specific structures of the compounds in Y.**\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\nLet Y = {Z, Aromatic Compound}.\nHydrogenation of Z (which is already a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z.\nTherefore, hydrogenation of the aromatic compound must also yield Z. This is a crucial clue: the aromatic compound and the cycloalkane Z must have the same carbon skeleton.\n\nLet's test possible ring sizes:\n*   **If the ring size is 6:** Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane. This is a consistent scenario. Also, cyclohexane is widely used as a solvent, matching the description of Z.\n*   **If the ring size is 7:** Z would be cycloheptane (C7H14). The corresponding aromatic compound would be toluene (C7H8). Hydrogenation of toluene yields methylcyclohexane, not cycloheptane. Their carbon skeletons are different (a 6-membered ring with a methyl group vs. a 7-membered ring). This scenario is incorrect.\n*   **If the ring size is 8:** Z would be cyclooctane (C8H16). The corresponding aromatic compounds (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes) would hydrogenate to ethylcyclohexane or dimethylcyclohexanes, not cyclooctane. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe only plausible case is the 6-carbon system.\nThus, we can identify:\n*   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n*   **Mixture Y = An equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane and Benzene (C6H6)**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that reacts to form Y.\n*   **Reaction:** A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (accepts hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (donates hydrogen).\n*   **Properties of X:**\n    1.  It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n    2.  Hydrogenation of both A and B gives cyclohexane, so they must both be C6 cyclic compounds.\n    3.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n\nLet's consider possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond (non-conjugated). It can be reduced to cyclohexane. This is a candidate.\n*   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):**\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It can be reduced to cyclohexane and oxidized to benzene. This is a candidate.\n\nLet's propose that mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (hydrogen acceptor) + C6H8 (hydrogen donor) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nThis reaction is balanced and fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.01 + y * 1.008).\n*   The value 14.28% is a very close approximation of 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). This implies that for every 1 unit of mass from hydrogen, there are 6 units of mass from carbon.\n*   The mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 6:1.\n*   The atomic mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 12:1.\n*   To find the atom ratio (y/x), we can set up the equation: (12 * x) / (1 * y) = 6 / 1, which simplifies to y/x = 12/6 = 2.\n*   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   This general formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that \"Z does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound, as an alkene would react with hydrogen (hydrogenation). Thus, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which we can call Y1 and Y2.\n*   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume Y1 = Z. So, Y1 is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture Y ... gives only one substance, ... Z\".\n*   Since Y1 is already Z (a saturated cycloalkane), it will not react with hydrogen. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y2 must produce Z.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z. This is characteristic of an aromatic compound that has the same carbon skeleton as Z. Aromatic compounds are resistant to reaction with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature).\n*   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then Y2 must be benzene (C6H6). Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then Y2 must be toluene (C7H8). Mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture X ... gives only one substance, ... Z\". This tells us that both X1 and X2 have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for our two scenarios.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** The products are cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). The reactants, X1 and X2, must both be C6 cyclic compounds. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 + 6 = 18. By conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one of X2) must also be 18.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** The products are methylcyclohexane (C7H14) and toluene (C7H8). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 14 + 8 = 22.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Let's focus on the more common and fundamental **Scenario A (C6 system)**.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, X1 and X2, whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n*   If we choose X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The problem adds a crucial constraint: \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so it is not conjugated.\n    *   There are two common cyclohexadienes: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, X2 must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   So, mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the released hydrogen atoms hydrogenate the cyclohexene to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. While the C7 scenario is also theoretically possible (leading to 22 hydrogen atoms, option B), the C6 system involving cyclohexane and benzene is a classic and fundamental example in organic chemistry, making it the most probable intended answer for this type of problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identifying Hydrocarbon Z\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 g/mol) and Hydrogen (≈1 g/mol), we can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. This equation does not yield an integer `n` for 14.28%.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = `(2n) / (14n)` = `2 / 14` = `1 / 7` ≈ 0.142857.\n*   This matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all other compounds. This points to a very stable and common cycloalkane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a prime candidate, as it is a widely used solvent and is the most stable six-carbon cycloalkane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z. Let the components of Y be Z and another substance, D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it could be a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) or an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y is described as a disproportionation. A classic example of a disproportionation reaction involving cyclic compounds is the conversion of a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene into a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound. For instance, cyclohexene can disproportionate to form cyclohexane and benzene. This strongly suggests that the other component (D) is benzene (C6H6).\n*   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This mixture is equimolar and its components fit the description.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Components of Mixture X and Solving the Question\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer (a form of disproportionation), where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in products (Mixture Y) = H atoms in Cyclohexane + H atoms in Benzene\n    *   Total H atoms in Y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (Mixture X) must also be 18.\n    *   Total H atoms in X = H atoms in molecule A + H atoms in molecule B = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this number is 18.\n\nTo confirm this is a plausible scenario, we can identify potential structures for A and B:\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B must yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies A and B are C6 cyclic compounds.\n*   A and B are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n*   A likely pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C6 rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene). In this reaction, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene, a chemically sound process under catalytic conditions.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using the approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), this simplifies to `y / (12x + y)`.\nSetting this equal to 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\nThis corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which is characteristic of cycloalkanes or alkenes. Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. For C6H12, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One of the components of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A very common compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions because doing so would disrupt its stable aromatic system. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X1 and X2), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`X1 + X2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\nSince the starting mixture X and the resulting mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Mixture X and Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nLet the molecular formula of X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. The carbon skeleton must be C6 because hydrogenation of both components yields cyclohexane.\nFrom the balanced reaction in Step 3, we can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n`a + b = 12 + 6`\n`a + b = 18`\nThis means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 is 18.\n\nTo verify this, we can identify plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n*   They must decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of each must yield cyclohexane.\n\nA logical choice for X1 and X2 that fits these criteria is cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** Has two double bonds which are isolated (not conjugated), so it decolorizes bromine water. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\nThe sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This type of disproportionation is known to occur over platinum catalysts.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\nTotal H atoms = (H in X1) + (H in X2) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. The mass fraction of carbon is therefore 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   To find the empirical formula, we can divide the mass percentages by the atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n        *   For H: 14.28 / 1 = 14.28\n        *   For C: 85.72 / 12 = 7.14\n    *   The ratio of H to C atoms is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, which does not fit the CH₂ ratio. However, the general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ, which perfectly matches the empirical formula.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given value. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions yields *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all chemical compounds present in both mixtures X and Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Upon the addition of hydrogen, they all convert to cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar (1:1 molar ratio) mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, disproportionation involves a hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture containing cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate dehydrogenation product of a six-carbon ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}. This mixture fits the description: it's equimolar, its components have a C₆ skeleton, and it doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of this mixture (cyclohexane stays the same, benzene becomes cyclohexane) yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total in the products: 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Both A and B must be based on a six-carbon ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's consider the possible unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated).\n    *   Let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two fits the reaction. Let A = Cyclohexene and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n        *   The reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n        *   This is a perfectly balanced reaction. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C₆H₆), and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This type of catalytic hydrogen transfer is a known process.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\n*   **Composition**: Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n*   **Formula Derivation**: Let the formula be CₓHᵧ. Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation**: The problem states Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n*   **Identification**: Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ and all other descriptions. Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mixture Y\n\n*   **Properties**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water (meaning its components are saturated or aromatic). Z (cyclohexane) is one of its components.\n*   **Hydrogenation**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Since one component is already cyclohexane, the other component must also be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n*   **Identification**: The second component must not decolorize bromine water but must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. This perfectly describes **benzene (C₆H₆)**, which is aromatic and unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Answer\n\n*   **The Reaction**: Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in a disproportionation reaction:\n    `Mixture X (X₁ + X₂) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene)`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms**: Since the reaction starts with an equimolar mixture (X₁ + X₂) and produces an equimolar mixture (Y₁ + Y₂), we can balance the atoms for a 1:1 reaction:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n*   **Hydrogen Balance**: The total number of hydrogen atoms on the product side is 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules (X₁ and X₂) must also be 18.\n*   **The Question**: The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This is precisely the sum we just calculated.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Components of Mixture X (for completeness)\n\n*   The components of X must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (since they decolorize bromine water and hydrogenate to cyclohexane) and must not have conjugated bonds.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms must be 18.\n*   The most logical candidates are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated, as required.\n*   This confirms that a valid mixture X exists, and the total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Matching this result with the given options:\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nIf an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 18\nD) 16\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using integer masses for simplicity (H=1, C=12), the fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428` (which is very close to 1/7).\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all the compounds in both mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. In catalysis, this often involves hydrogen transfer, leading to a more saturated and a less saturated (often aromatic) compound.\n    *   A plausible second component for Y would be benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would convert benzene to cyclohexane (`C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂`), and cyclohexane would not react. The final product would be only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that react to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is reduced to cyclohexane and the other is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. The products have 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the two molecules of mixture X must also have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The components of X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The logical precursors to cyclohexane and benzene with a C₆ ring are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈).\n    *   There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so we must use **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The other component must be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**.\n    *   Let's check if these two components fit the conditions.\n        *   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)\n        *   X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Neither has conjugated double bonds.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenation of mixture X (cyclohexene + 1,4-cyclohexadiene) would yield only cyclohexane. This also fits.\n    *   So, **mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula simplifies to `y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428`.\n*   This gives `y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)`, which simplifies to `0.8572y ≈ 1.7136x`, or `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   The empirical formula is CH₂, and the molecular formula is (CH₂)n or CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane (CnH2n) is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given data.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Mixture X, which is unsaturated, is converted to the saturated/aromatic mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. This points towards a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. A well-known example is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   For a C₆ system, a cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene would disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. So, mixture Y fits this description.\n    *   Upon hydrogenation, cyclohexane does not react, while benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). Thus, hydrogenating mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We have established the reaction that forms Y: `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`, where A and B are the equimolar components of mixture X.\n*   By balancing the atoms, the sum of the formulas of A and B must be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and both get hydrogenated to the same C₆ skeleton (cyclohexane), they must both be C₆ hydrocarbons, let's say C₆Hx and C₆Hy.\n*   Therefore, x + y = 18.\n*   The properties of mixture X are:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both A and B yields only cyclohexane (Z). This confirms they must have a six-membered ring structure.\n*   Let's find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic isomers that fit the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** is a prime candidate. It has one double bond and would decolorize bromine water. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   To satisfy x + y = 18, if A is C₆H₁₀, then B must be C₆H₈.\n    *   We need a non-conjugated C₆H₈ isomer with a six-membered ring. **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits this description perfectly. Its two double bonds are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. It also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The other common isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mix of cyclohexene (A = C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (B = C₆H₈).\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the monoene is reduced to the alkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of Z**: We'll use the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) to find the empirical and molecular formula of the hydrocarbon Z. Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be an alkane or a cycloalkane. The mass fraction strongly suggests a CnH2n formula, characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Z and Mixture Y**: Based on the chemical properties described (common solvent, product of hydrogenation, part of a disproportionation reaction), we can deduce the specific structure of Z. The properties of mixture Y (does not decolorize bromine water, hydrogenates to Z) allow us to identify its two components, one of which is Z. The most plausible scenario involves a C6 carbon skeleton, making Z cyclohexane and the other component of Y benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**: The reaction where mixture X forms mixture Y is a disproportionation, specifically a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is dehydrogenated to form benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**: By setting up a hydrogen balance for the disproportionation reaction, we can create an equation relating the number of hydrogen atoms in the two components of mixture X. Solving this equation will give the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry problem by following a logical deduction based on the provided information.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.\n    # Z is a hydrocarbon (CnHm) with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    # Mass fraction H = (mass of H) / (total mass)\n    # Using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1:\n    # 0.1428 is approximately 1/7.\n    # For a formula CnHm, the mass fraction of H is m / (12n + m).\n    # m / (12n + m) = 1/7  => 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.\n    # The formula for Z is CnH2n.

Since the empirical formula is CH2, the molecular formula must be of the form CnH2n. This indicates that Z is a cycloalkane.\nLet's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016n / 14.027n ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28% (1/7 ≈ 0.142857). So, Z is indeed a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify hydrocarbon Z and mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all components of X and Y have a carbon skeleton that can be converted to the skeleton of Z upon hydrogenation. If Z is cyclohexane, all components must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, does not decolorize bromine water, and contains Z as one of its components. Let Y = {Z, W}.\n*   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, both Z and W must be saturated compounds (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (no reaction), and hydrogenation of W must also give Z.\n*   This leads to a crucial point. If W is a saturated cycloalkane isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation to Z would involve skeletal rearrangement, which is possible under \"severe conditions\". However, let's consider the disproportionation reaction first.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the disproportionation reaction and identify mixture X.**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y. This is a disproportionation.\n*   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B. Let the two components of the equimolar mixture Y be Z and W.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Z + W (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   We know Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). So, one product is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means W must also not react with bromine water. A highly unsaturated but stable aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6) fits this description. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Let's test this hypothesis: Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already saturated. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12). So, hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the condition.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. This fits.\n*   Now we can deduce A and B from the reaction: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   The total atoms on the product side are C12H18. This must be the same for the reactants A + B.\n    *   A and B are in an equimolar mixture, and their hydrogenation both yield cyclohexane. This means A and B must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's find two C6 cyclic alkenes, A and B, that sum to C12H18. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total formula is C10H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n    *   The problem specifies no conjugated bonds. 1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated. Therefore, the diene must be 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n*   So, let's finalize the identities:\n    *   **Mixture X** = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n    *   **Mixture Y** = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   **Substance Z** = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n\n**Step 4: Verify all conditions.**\n*   **X**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H10, C6H8). Decolorizes Br2 water (due to C=C). No conjugated bonds (1,4-diene is not conjugated). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Reaction**: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) yielding an equimolar mixture Y. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Y**: Equimolar mixture of two liquids (C6H12, C6H6). Does not decolorize Br2 water (cyclohexane is saturated, benzene is unreactive). **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 + H2 → C6H12. C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H12 → C6H12. C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12. Gives only Z. **(Checks out)**\n*   **Z**: C6H12, a hydrocarbon solvent, H% is 14.28%, constituent of Y. **(Checks out)**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass)\n\nThe value 14.28% is equivalent to the decimal 0.1428. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's assume the ratio of hydrogen mass to total mass is 1/7. Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity:\n1/7 = (y × 1) / (x × 12 + y × 1)\n12x + y = 7y\n12x = 6y\ny/x = 2/1\n\nThis gives an empirical formula of CH2. The general molecular formula is therefore (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\nZ is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent.\" The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is cyclohexane, C6H12.\nThis fits all the descriptions, so we can confidently identify **Z as cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's call the two components of Y, C and D. So, C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\nMixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" Cyclohexane (C) is saturated and does not react. Therefore, the other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water. This suggests D is either a saturated compound or an aromatic compound (which does not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\nHydrogenation(C + D) → Z only\nHydrogenation(cyclohexane + D) → cyclohexane only\nSince cyclohexane is already saturated, it does not react. This means that the hydrogenation of D must yield cyclohexane.\nSo, D must be a C6 hydrocarbon that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Given that D does not decolorize bromine water, the most plausible candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under standard test conditions, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\nTherefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction, which means one component is oxidized while the other is reduced.\nA + B → C + D\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X loses hydrogen to form benzene (oxidation), and the other component gains hydrogen to form cyclohexane (reduction).\nThe total number of atoms must be conserved.\nTotal C atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 6 (from cyclohexane) = 12.\nTotal H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\nTherefore, the two molecules A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\nWe are also told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons, and their carbon skeletons can be hydrogenated to a six-membered ring. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\nFrom the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\nWe have several constraints for A and B:\n1.  Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water,\" so at least one component must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This means their hydrogen counts must be less than that of the corresponding saturated cycloalkane (C6H12). So, x < 12 and y < 12.\n2.  \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n\nWe need to find two different integers, x and y, that satisfy x + y = 18, with both x < 12 and y < 12. Since stable hydrocarbons typically have an even number of hydrogen atoms, we look for a pair of even integers. The only pair that fits these conditions is **8 and 10**.\nSo, the components of mixture X have the formulas C6H8 and C6H10.\n\nLet's identify the specific structures:\n*   **C6H10**: This must be **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This fits all conditions.\n*   **C6H8**: This must be a cyclohexadiene. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Therefore, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It has two isolated double bonds, decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This also fits all conditions.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two components.\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n```python\n# This code performs the final addition based on the derived molecular formulas.\n# The first liquid in mixture X is cyclohexene, C6H10.\n# The second liquid in mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8.\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 = 10\nhydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2 = 8\ntotal_hydrogen_atoms = hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_1 + hydrogen_atoms_in_liquid_2\nprint(total_hydrogen_atoms)\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 18\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen is approximately 14.28%, which is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n*   If Z were an alkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n*   If Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given value of 14.28%.\n\nTherefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that:\n*   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n\nLet the two components of Y be C and D. We can set C = Z = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). For the hydrogenation of Y to yield only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also be converted into cyclohexane.\n\nThe reaction X → Y is a disproportionation, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen). Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully reduced C₆ ring, the other product (D) is likely the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\nLet's check if this composition for Y fits the description:\n*   **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}**\n*   **Does not decolorize bromine water**: Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   **Hydrogenation gives only Z**: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). This is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction and Mixture X\n\nThe transformation of mixture X into mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene, the reaction can be written as:\n\n**Component A + Component B (from Mixture X) → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (Mixture Y)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the equation. Both components of X must have a C₆ carbon skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to a C₆ product (cyclohexane). Let the formulas of the two components of X be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n\nThe hydrogen balance is:\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component, which is 18.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Properties of Mixture X\n\nWe can further validate this by identifying plausible structures for the components of X.\n*   They must be unsaturated C₆ compounds to decolorize bromine water.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction C₆Hₐ + C₆Hₑ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ must be a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n\nA plausible scenario is the transfer of two hydrogen atoms:\n*   C₆H₁₀ + 2H → C₆H₁₂ (Reduction)\n*   C₆H₈ - 2H → C₆H₆ (Oxidation/Dehydrogenation)\n\nThis implies that mixture X is composed of a C₆H₁₀ isomer and a C₆H₈ isomer.\n*   **C₆H₁₀**: **Cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, decolorizes bromine water, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. It does not have conjugated bonds.\n*   **C₆H₈**: A cyclohexadiene. To meet the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, this must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene. 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation of cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene over a platinum catalyst to yield cyclohexane and benzene is a known type of reaction, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis.\n\nThus, a mixture X composed of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) fits all the conditions described in the problem. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the provided chemical problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z\n\n1.  **Analyze the composition of Z**: The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n2.  **Determine the formula type**: The mass percentage 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   For a general cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n, the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7. This matches the given data.\n    *   For a general alkane with the formula CnH2n+2, the mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n+2) / (14n+2). Setting this to 1/7 leads to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n3.  **Conclusion for Z**: Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also mentions it is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Properties of Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n2.  **Components of Y**: One component of Y is Z, which we identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\n3.  **Hydrogenation of Y**: Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components of Y must have the same carbon skeleton. The other component must be a C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n4.  **Identify the second component**: Since the second component does not decolorize bromine water, it is likely aromatic. Benzene (C6H6) is the aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane.\n5.  **Conclusion for Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction\n\n1.  **Properties of X**: Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n2.  **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both components of X are C6 cyclic compounds.\n3.  **The Reaction (X → Y)**: Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context is a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Let the two components of X be A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n4.  **Conservation of Atoms**: Since the reaction is a 1:1 transformation of an equimolar mixture, we can balance the atoms. Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n    *   Carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 → 6+6).\n    *   Hydrogen atoms must also be balanced: x + y = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structures of Components in X and Calculate the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify possible structures**: The components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons without conjugated bonds. The most common examples are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n2.  **Check for non-conjugated bonds**:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has one double bond, so there is no conjugation. This is a valid candidate.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) exists as two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  **Solve for components**: We need two molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n4.  **Verify the reaction**: The proposed reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Such disproportionation and hydrogen transfer reactions over platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon formed from the hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, and it does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let the formula for Z be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is equivalent to 1/7.\n*   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n*   `7m = 12n + m`\n*   `6m = 12n`\n*   `m = 2n`\n*   The general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n\n*   **Hydrogenation:** Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies that all constituent compounds in both mixtures are composed of a six-carbon atom ring structure.\n*   **Mixture Y:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated. One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components of Y, C and D. So, D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12). The other component, C, must also be saturated and must produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A well-known substance that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Under severe conditions (high pressure and temperature), it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and one component is Z. This fits the description.\n\n**3. Deduce the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   **Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y\n*   Let the components of the equimolar mixture X be A and B.\n*   The reaction is: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   This reaction must be balanced in terms of atoms. The products have a total of 12 carbon atoms (6+6) and 18 hydrogen atoms (6+12). Therefore, the reactants A and B must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since all compounds have a C6 skeleton, A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   **Properties of Mixture X:**\n    *   It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Let's consider the hydrogen transfer. To form benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12), one reactant must donate hydrogen and the other must accept it. A plausible scenario involves cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let's identify A and B. A logical candidate for the hydrogen acceptor is cyclohexene (C6H10). A logical candidate for the hydrogen donor is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The reaction would be: Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   Carbons: 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   Hydrogens: 8 + 10 = 18 on the left; 6 + 12 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   This reaction is a known type of disproportionation called Zelinsky-Kazansky catalysis, where a hydrogen donor (like a diene) and a hydrogen acceptor (like an alkene) react over a platinum catalyst to yield more stable products (an aromatic compound and an alkane).\n*   Now let's check if these components for X fit all conditions:\n    *   **A = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** It is unsaturated. The double bonds are not conjugated. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   **B = Cyclohexene (C6H10):** It is unsaturated. It has only one double bond, so no conjugation. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture X = {1,4-Cyclohexadiene, Cyclohexene}. This fits all the given conditions.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass is `12n + m` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value, 14.28%, is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, so `6m ≈ 12n`, which simplifies to `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means the other component of Y, let's call it Y2, must also be converted to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it is not a simple alkene/alkyne. For it to be hydrogenated to a cycloalkane Z (CnH2n), Y2 is most likely an aromatic hydrocarbon. The hydrogenation of an aromatic ring requires severe conditions, which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic hydrocarbons are based on a benzene ring. Let's assume the simplest case, where the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring (n=6).\n    *   This makes Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound Y2 would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. Both are liquids and neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2, that undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form an equimolar mixture of Y = (cyclohexane, benzene).\n    *   The overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. To balance the atoms, the total formula of the reactants must be C12H18. Since X is an equimolar mixture, each molecule on average has the formula C6H9.\n    *   Let X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. Since the mixture is equimolar, the average number of hydrogen atoms is `(a + b) / 2 = 9`, which means `a + b = 18`.\n    *   The components of X decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated. They must also have a C6 ring skeleton because their hydrogenation leads to cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   Let's look for possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond (non-conjugated). `a = 10`.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds. `b = 8`. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check if these two compounds fit the condition `a + b = 18`.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. Yes, they fit perfectly.\n    *   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Process:**\n    *   **X**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   **Reaction**: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). The reaction produces an equimolar mixture of products.\n    *   **Y**: Equimolar mix of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are \"saturated\" towards bromine water.\n    *   **Z**: Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is a component of Y, a common solvent, and fits the mass percentage of hydrogen.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: `C6H10 + H2 -> C6H12` and `C6H8 + 2H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y**: `C6H12 -> C6H12` and `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`. Both give only Z.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CnHm.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass Fraction H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`. Using atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n*   This can be rearranged to `m / (12n) ≈ 0.1428 / (1 - 0.1428) = 0.1428 / 0.8572 ≈ 1/6`.\n*   So, `m / n ≈ 12 / 6 = 2`. The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and Identify Z**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Z`: Since C=Z and Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This is consistent.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`: D must be converted to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene or alkyne. The two main possibilities are:\n        1.  D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane if Z is cyclohexane). These can isomerize to the more stable Z under severe hydrogenation conditions.\n        2.  D is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to Z (e.g., benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. This is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) is converted to Mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n*   The simplest stoichiometric representation of this is: `A + B -> C + D`.\n*   Let's consider the two possibilities for D identified in Step 2, assuming the most common cycloalkane solvent, cyclohexane (C6H12), as Z.\n    *   **Case 1**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is a saturated isomer, also C6H12.\n        The reaction would be `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H12`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, if A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then `x + y = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n        However, A and B are components of mixture X, which decolorizes bromine water, so they must be unsaturated. They also hydrogenate to form Z (cyclohexane), so they must be C6 compounds. The most hydrogen-rich unsaturated C6 cyclic compound is cyclohexene (C6H10). If both A and B were cyclohexene (which is not possible as they are different liquids), the total hydrogen count would be 10 + 10 = 20. For any other pair of different unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, the sum will be less than 20. Therefore, `x + y = 24` is impossible. This case is ruled out.\n    *   **Case 2**: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), and D is its aromatic counterpart, Benzene (C6H6).\n        This fits the properties of Y: {cyclohexane, benzene} is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, and upon severe hydrogenation, both yield cyclohexane. Z (cyclohexane) is a component.\n        The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        By conservation of hydrogen atoms, `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`. This is a plausible outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We need to find two different liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy), that satisfy the following conditions:\n    1.  `x + y = 18`.\n    2.  Both A and B are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n    3.  Hydrogenation of both A and B yields cyclohexane (Z). This implies they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    4.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n*   Let's list the possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). Here, x = 10.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Here, x = 8. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n*   Let's see if we can form a pair from these that sums to 18.\n    *   If we choose A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), then `10 + y = 18`, which gives `y = 8`.\n    *   This means B must be C6H8. The non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n*   So, the mixture X consists of A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). This pair fits all the conditions of the problem. The disproportionation reaction is a hydrogen transfer from the diene to the alkene: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Number of H atoms in A (Cyclohexene, C6H10) = 10.\n*   Number of H atoms in B (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8) = 8.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the general formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass % H = (Total mass of H) / (Total molar mass of compound) * 100%\nMass % H = (m × Ar(H)) / (n × Ar(C) + m × Ar(H)) * 100%\n\nUsing the approximate atomic masses Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12, we can set up the equation. The value 14.28% is a well-known fraction: 14.28% ≈ 100/7 % = 1/7.\nSo, we can write:\nm / (12n + m) = 1/7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\n\nThis gives the general formula for Z as CnH2n. The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y and the disproportionation reaction.**\nMixture Y is formed by heating mixture X with platinum, which causes a disproportionation. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. We also know that Z is one of the components of Y.\nSo, one component of Y is a cycloalkane (Z, with formula CnH2n). For the mixture to not decolorize bromine water, the other component must also be saturated or aromatic.\n\nThe reaction type (heating with a platinum catalyst leading to disproportionation) is characteristic of catalytic hydrogen transfer, often called Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. In this reaction, an unsaturated cyclic compound is converted into a mixture of a fully saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\nTherefore, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic compound.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the specific structures of the compounds in Y.**\nThe problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\nLet Y = {Z, Aromatic Compound}.\nHydrogenation of Z (which is already a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z.\nTherefore, hydrogenation of the aromatic compound must also yield Z. This is a crucial clue: the aromatic compound and the cycloalkane Z must have the same carbon skeleton.\n\nLet's test possible ring sizes:\n*   **If the ring size is 6:** Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane. This is a consistent scenario. Also, cyclohexane is widely used as a solvent, matching the description of Z.\n*   **If the ring size is 7:** Z would be cycloheptane (C7H14). The corresponding aromatic compound would be toluene (C7H8). Hydrogenation of toluene yields methylcyclohexane, not cycloheptane. Their carbon skeletons are different (a 6-membered ring with a methyl group vs. a 7-membered ring). This scenario is incorrect.\n*   **If the ring size is 8:** Z would be cyclooctane (C8H16). The corresponding aromatic compounds (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes) would hydrogenate to ethylcyclohexane or dimethylcyclohexanes, not cyclooctane. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe only plausible case is the 6-carbon system.\nThus, we can identify:\n*   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n*   **Mixture Y = An equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane and Benzene (C6H6)**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that reacts to form Y.\n*   **Reaction:** A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (accepts hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (donates hydrogen).\n*   **Properties of X:**\n    1.  It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated.\n    2.  Hydrogenation of both A and B gives cyclohexane, so they must both be C6 cyclic compounds.\n    3.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n\nLet's consider possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond (non-conjugated). It can be reduced to cyclohexane. This is a candidate.\n*   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):**\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it is excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It can be reduced to cyclohexane and oxidized to benzene. This is a candidate.\n\nLet's propose that mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n*   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be:\nC6H10 (hydrogen acceptor) + C6H8 (hydrogen donor) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nThis reaction is balanced and fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.01 + y * 1.008).\n*   The value 14.28% is a very close approximation of 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). This implies that for every 1 unit of mass from hydrogen, there are 6 units of mass from carbon.\n*   The mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 6:1.\n*   The atomic mass ratio of Carbon to Hydrogen is approximately 12:1.\n*   To find the atom ratio (y/x), we can set up the equation: (12 * x) / (1 * y) = 6 / 1, which simplifies to y/x = 12/6 = 2.\n*   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   This general formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that \"Z does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound, as an alkene would react with hydrogen (hydrogenation). Thus, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which we can call Y1 and Y2.\n*   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume Y1 = Z. So, Y1 is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture Y ... gives only one substance, ... Z\".\n*   Since Y1 is already Z (a saturated cycloalkane), it will not react with hydrogen. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y2 must produce Z.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but it can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z. This is characteristic of an aromatic compound that has the same carbon skeleton as Z. Aromatic compounds are resistant to reaction with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature).\n*   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then Y2 must be benzene (C6H6). Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then Y2 must be toluene (C7H8). Mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   \"Hydrogenation of ... mixture X ... gives only one substance, ... Z\". This tells us that both X1 and X2 have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as:\n    X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for our two scenarios.\n    *   **Scenario A (C6 system):** The products are cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). The reactants, X1 and X2, must both be C6 cyclic compounds. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 + 6 = 18. By conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one of X2) must also be 18.\n    *   **Scenario B (C7 system):** The products are methylcyclohexane (C7H14) and toluene (C7H8). The total number of hydrogen atoms is 14 + 8 = 22.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Let's focus on the more common and fundamental **Scenario A (C6 system)**.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds, X1 and X2, whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n*   If we choose X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = a cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The problem adds a crucial constraint: \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so it is not conjugated.\n    *   There are two common cyclohexadienes: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, X2 must be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   So, mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    This is a plausible hydrogen transfer reaction where the diene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the released hydrogen atoms hydrogenate the cyclohexene to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. While the C7 scenario is also theoretically possible (leading to 22 hydrogen atoms, option B), the C6 system involving cyclohexane and benzene is a classic and fundamental example in organic chemistry, making it the most probable intended answer for this type of problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identifying Hydrocarbon Z\n\n*   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 g/mol) and Hydrogen (≈1 g/mol), we can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. This equation does not yield an integer `n` for 14.28%.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = `(2n) / (14n)` = `2 / 14` = `1 / 7` ≈ 0.142857.\n*   This matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all other compounds. This points to a very stable and common cycloalkane. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a prime candidate, as it is a widely used solvent and is the most stable six-carbon cycloalkane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n### 2. Identifying the Components of Mixture Y\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z. Let the components of Y be Z and another substance, D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it could be a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) or an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water without a catalyst and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   The formation of Y is described as a disproportionation. A classic example of a disproportionation reaction involving cyclic compounds is the conversion of a cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene into a cycloalkane and an aromatic compound. For instance, cyclohexene can disproportionate to form cyclohexane and benzene. This strongly suggests that the other component (D) is benzene (C6H6).\n*   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This mixture is equimolar and its components fit the description.\n\n### 3. Identifying the Components of Mixture X and Solving the Question\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer (a form of disproportionation), where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms in products (Mixture Y) = H atoms in Cyclohexane + H atoms in Benzene\n    *   Total H atoms in Y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (Mixture X) must also be 18.\n    *   Total H atoms in X = H atoms in molecule A + H atoms in molecule B = 18.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Based on the conservation of atoms in the reaction, this number is 18.\n\nTo confirm this is a plausible scenario, we can identify potential structures for A and B:\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B must yield only cyclohexane (Z). This implies A and B are C6 cyclic compounds.\n*   A and B are unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n*   The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n*   A likely pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C6 rings.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated.\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene). In this reaction, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene, a chemically sound process under catalytic conditions.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using the approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), this simplifies to `y / (12x + y)`.\nSetting this equal to 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\nThis corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which is characteristic of cycloalkanes or alkenes. Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. For C6H12, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One of the components of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A very common compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions because doing so would disrupt its stable aromatic system. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X1 and X2), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`X1 + X2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\nSince the starting mixture X and the resulting mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Mixture X and Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nLet the molecular formula of X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. The carbon skeleton must be C6 because hydrogenation of both components yields cyclohexane.\nFrom the balanced reaction in Step 3, we can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n`a + b = 12 + 6`\n`a + b = 18`\nThis means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 is 18.\n\nTo verify this, we can identify plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n*   They must decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of each must yield cyclohexane.\n\nA logical choice for X1 and X2 that fits these criteria is cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** Has two double bonds which are isolated (not conjugated), so it decolorizes bromine water. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\nThe sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This type of disproportionation is known to occur over platinum catalysts.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\nTotal H atoms = (H in X1) + (H in X2) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. The mass fraction of carbon is therefore 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   To find the empirical formula, we can divide the mass percentages by the atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1):\n        *   For H: 14.28 / 1 = 14.28\n        *   For C: 85.72 / 12 = 7.14\n    *   The ratio of H to C atoms is 14.28 / 7.14 ≈ 2. So, the empirical formula is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, which does not fit the CH₂ ratio. However, the general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ, which perfectly matches the empirical formula.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. Let's verify the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given value. Thus, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions yields *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all chemical compounds present in both mixtures X and Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Upon the addition of hydrogen, they all convert to cyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar (1:1 molar ratio) mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Y is formed from X by a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum. In this context, disproportionation involves a hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture containing cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate dehydrogenation product of a six-carbon ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}. This mixture fits the description: it's equimolar, its components have a C₆ skeleton, and it doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of this mixture (cyclohexane stays the same, benzene becomes cyclohexane) yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must equal the total in the products: 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Both A and B must be based on a six-carbon ring, as they hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's consider the possible unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Has one double bond (non-conjugated).\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated).\n    *   Let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two fits the reaction. Let A = Cyclohexene and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene.\n        *   The reaction would be: C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\n        *   This is a perfectly balanced reaction. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C₆H₆), and the cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This type of catalytic hydrogen transfer is a known process.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
