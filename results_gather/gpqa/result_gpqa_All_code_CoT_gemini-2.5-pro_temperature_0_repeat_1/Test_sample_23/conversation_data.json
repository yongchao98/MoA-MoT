    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. A general hydrocarbon formula is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) = 0.1428`. This simplifies to `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, or `6y ≈ 12x`, leading to `y ≈ 2x`. The empirical formula is CH2. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it doesn't react further with hydrogen), its general formula must be CnH2n, which corresponds to a cycloalkane. A common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is formed by disproportionation, and its components (let's call them C and D) do not decolorize bromine water, meaning they are saturated or aromatic. We are told Z is a component of Y, so let C = Z = CnH2n (cyclohexane). When mixture Y is hydrogenated, it gives only Z. This means that hydrogenating D must also yield Z. For this to happen, D must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton, which would be CnH(2n-6) (benzene, C6H6). Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y. The reaction is: `A + B -> C + D`. Substituting the identified substances for Y, we get: `A + B -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Atoms:** According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (A and B) must be equal to the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products, cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms:** We will calculate the sum of hydrogen atoms from cyclohexane (12) and benzene (6).\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in the products of the disproportionation reaction.\n# Based on the problem analysis, substance Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n), and the most likely candidate\n# that is a common solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n# The other product in mixture Y must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton, which is benzene (C6H6).\n# Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\nh_atoms_in_cyclohexane = 12\nh_atoms_in_benzene = 6\n\n# Step 2: Apply the law of conservation of atoms.\n# The reaction is: Mixture X (A + B) -> Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene).\n# The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A and B) must equal the\n# total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\ntotal_h_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_in_cyclohexane + h_atoms_in_benzene\n\n# Step 3: Print the final result and the corresponding option.\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane is: {h_atoms_in_cyclohexane}\")\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in benzene is: {h_atoms_in_benzene}\")\nprint(f\"The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum: {h_atoms_in_cyclohexane} + {h_atoms_in_benzene} = {total_h_atoms_in_X}\")\n\n# Step 4: Match the result with the given options.\n# A) 16\n# B) 12\n# C) 18\n# D) 22\n# The calculated result is 18, which corresponds to option C.\nprint(\"The correct option is C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
