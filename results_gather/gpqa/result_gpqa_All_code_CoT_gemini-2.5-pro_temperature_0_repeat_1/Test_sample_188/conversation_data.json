    "To solve this problem, I will analyze each of the given particles in the context of modern physics, specifically focusing on the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and Goldstone's theorem.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Briefly explain the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and Goldstone's theorem, which states that such a breaking of a continuous symmetry implies the existence of massless particles called Goldstone bosons.\n2.  Examine each particle:\n    *   **Pion:** I will check its relation to the chiral symmetry of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\n    *   **Magnon:** I will check its relation to the rotational symmetry in magnetic materials like ferromagnets.\n    *   **Phonon:** I will check its relation to the translational symmetry in crystalline solids.\n    *   **Skyrmion:** I will analyze its nature as a topological object.\n3.  Based on this analysis, I will identify the particle that is not a Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneously broken symmetry.\n4.  The Python code will then print out this step-by-step reasoning and state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_particle_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The question asks to identify which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\")\n    print(\"This concept is explained by Goldstone's Theorem, which states that when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, a massless particle (or excitation), known as a Goldstone boson, must exist.\\n\")\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'particle': 'Pion',\n            'explanation': \"Pions are the (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
