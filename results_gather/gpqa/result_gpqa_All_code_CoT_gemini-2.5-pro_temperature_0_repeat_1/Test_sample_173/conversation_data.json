    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Initial Conditions:** We are given the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (M * c^2 = 300 GeV), the mass ratio of the two fragments (m1 = 2 * m2), and the relationship between the initial and final rest masses (m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M).\n\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:** Using the given relationships, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n\n3.  **Determine Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):** The total kinetic energy released in the fission is the \"missing\" mass, which is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments. This energy is shared between the two fragments.\n\n4.  **Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):** In classical mechanics, from the conservation of momentum (which is zero initially), the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`p1 = p2`). Since classical kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses (`T1/T2 = m2/m1`). Using this ratio and the total kinetic energy, we can calculate the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1_classical`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 (Relativistic):** For the correct relativistic calculation, we again use the conservation of momentum (`p1 = p2`). The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where `E` is the total energy (`T + mc^2`). By equating the momentum terms (`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`), we can form an equation relating the total energies and rest-mass energies of the fragments: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`. We can solve this equation for the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T1`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:** Finally, we will calculate the difference between the relativistic `T1` and the classical `T1_classical` and convert the result from GeV to MeV to match the units in the options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define Initial Conditions\nM_rest_energy = 300  # in GeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n# We have two equations:\n# 1) m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2\n# 2) m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M_rest_energy\n# Substitute (1) into (2):\n# 2 * m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M_rest_energy\n# 3 * m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M_rest_energy\nm2_rest_energy = 0.99 * M_rest_energy / 3\nm1_rest_energy = 2 * m2_rest_energy\n\n# Step 3: Determine Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\nQ_value = M_rest_energy - (m1_rest_energy + m2_rest_energy)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)\n# From momentum conservation (p1=p2) and T = p^2/(2m), we get T1/T2 = m2/m1.\n# T1_classical + T2_classical = Q_value\n# T1_classical + T1_classical * (m1/m2) = Q_value\n# T1_classical * (1 + m1/m2) = Q_value\n# Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio m1/m2 is 2.\n# T1_classical * (1 + 2) = Q_value\nT1_classical = Q_value / 3\n\n# Step 5: Calculate T1 (Relativistic)\n# From momentum conservation (p1=p2) and E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, we get:\n# E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n# where E1 = T1 + m1*c^2 and E2 = T2 + m2*c^2 = (Q_value - T1) + m2*c^2\n# (T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = ((Q_value - T1) + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = (Q_value - T1)^2 + 2*(Q_value - T1)*m2*c^2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = Q_value^2 - 2*Q_value*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q_value*m2*c^2 - 2*T1*m2*c^2\n# 2*T1*m1*c^2 = Q_value^2 - 2*Q_value*T1 + 2*Q_value*m2*c^2 - 2*T1*m2*c^2\n# T1 * (2*m1*c^2 + 2*Q_value + 2*m2*c^2) = Q_value^2 + 2*Q_value*m2*c^2\n# T1 * 2 * (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q_value) = Q_value * (Q_value + 2*m2*c^2)\n# T1 * 2 * M_rest_energy = Q_value * (Q_value + 2*m2*c^2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q_value * (Q_value + 2 * m2_rest_energy)) / (2 * M_rest_energy)\n\n# Step 6: Find the Difference\n# The difference is in GeV, convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
