    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` and then use this information to assess the renormalizability of the theory. This process is known as power counting.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Establish Mass Dimensions of Known Quantities:** In natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`), the action `S = ∫d⁴x L` is dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `[M]⁻⁴`, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[M]⁴`. We will use this to find the dimensions of the fields.\n2.  **Dimension of Fermion Field (`ψ`):** The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_fermion ∝ \\bar{\\psi}∂̸ψ`. For this term to have a dimension of `[M]⁴`, we have `[\\bar{\\psi}] + [∂] + [ψ] = 4`. Since `[∂] = [M]¹` and `[\\bar{\\psi}] = [ψ]`, we get `2[ψ] + 1 = 4`, which means `[ψ] = [M]³/²`.\n3.  **Dimension of Field Strength Tensor (`F`):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM ∝ F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}`. For this to have a dimension of `[M]⁴`, we have `2[F] = 4`, which means `[F] = [M]²`.\n4.  **Calculate Dimension of `κ`:** We use the interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κ\\bar{\\psi}σ_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}`. The dimension of `L_int` must also be `[M]⁴`. The `σ_{\\mu\\nu}` term is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, the dimensional equation is `[L_int] = [κ] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [ψ] + [F]`. We will solve this for `[κ]`.\n5.  **Determine Renormalizability:** A theory is generally considered non-renormalizable if it has a coupling constant with a negative mass dimension.\n    *   If `[coupling] < 0`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n    *   If `[coupling] ≥ 0`, the theory is renormalizable (or super-renormalizable).\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:** Based on the calculated dimension of `κ` and the renormalizability criterion, we will choose the correct option from A, B, C, or D.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Define the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density.\n# In natural units (hbar=c=1), the action S = integral(d^4x * L) is dimensionless.\n# The dimension of d^4x is [M]^-4, so the dimension of L must be [M]^4.\ndim_L = 4\n\n# Step 2: Determine the mass dimension of the fermion field psi.\n# The kinetic term is L_fermion ~ \\bar{\\psi} * d_mu * \\psi.\n# [L_fermion] = [\\bar{\\psi}] + [d_mu] + [\\psi] = 4.\n# Since [d_mu] = 1 and [\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi], we have 2*[\\psi] + 1 = 4.\ndim_psi = (4 - 1) / 2\n\n# Step 3: Determine the mass dimension of the field strength tensor F.\n# The kinetic term is L_EM ~ F * F.\n# [L_EM] = [F] + [F] = 4.\n# So, 2*[F] = 4.\ndim_F = 4 / 2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the mass dimension of kappa from the interaction term.\n# L_int = kappa * \\bar{\\psi} * sigma * \\psi * F\n# The sigma matrices are dimensionless.\n# [L_int] = [kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] + [F] = 4.\n# [kappa] = 4 - [\\bar{\\psi}] - [\\psi] - [F]\ndim_kappa = dim_L - dim_psi - dim_psi - dim_F\n\nprint(f\"The mass dimension of the fermion field [psi] is: {dim_psi}\")\nprint(f\"The mass dimension of the field strength tensor [F] is: {dim_F}\")\nprint(f\"The mass dimension of the coupling constant [kappa] is: {dim_kappa}\")\n\n# Step 5: Determine renormalizability.\n# A theory is non-renormalizable if any of its coupling constants have a negative mass dimension.\nif dim_kappa < 0:\n    renormalizability = \"not renormalizable\"\nelse:\n    renormalizability = \"renormalizable\"\n\nprint(f\"Since the mass dimension of kappa is negative, the theory is {renormalizability}.\")\n\n# Step 6: Select the correct option.\nif dim_kappa == 1 and renormalizability == \"renormalizable\":\n    choice = \"A\"\nelif dim_kappa == -1 and renormalizability == \"not renormalizable\":\n    choice = \"B\"\nelif dim_kappa == 1 and renormalizability == \"not renormalizable\":\n    choice = \"C\"\nelif dim_kappa == -1 and renormalizability == \"renormalizable\":\n    choice = \"D\"\nelse:\n    choice = \"Unknown\"\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(f\"The mass dimension [kappa]_M = {int(dim_kappa)}.
