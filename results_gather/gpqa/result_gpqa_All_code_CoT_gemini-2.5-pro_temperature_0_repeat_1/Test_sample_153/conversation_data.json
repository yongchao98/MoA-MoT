    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 gives the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The M+2 peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This 3:1 ratio of M+ to M+2 is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy data:**\n    *   The very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The 's' (singlet) and integration for one proton (1H) confirm this assignment.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. This symmetry means there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the ring.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the proposed structures:**\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Its molecular weight is 156 g/mol, it contains one chlorine atom, it is a carboxylic acid, and it has a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided spectral data.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the NMR.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the 1,2- (ortho) substitution would result in a more complex NMR spectrum with four distinct signals in the aromatic region, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would have an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm and would lack the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the comprehensive analysis, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only structure that matches all the evidence.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectral data to identify an unknown compound from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data:\")\n    \n    # Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n    print(\"\\n1.
