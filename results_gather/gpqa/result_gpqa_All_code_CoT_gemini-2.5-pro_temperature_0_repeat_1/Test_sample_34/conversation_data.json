    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will define the matrix operator `Ay` based on the problem description. The constant `c` is `h/(4*pi)`, which is equivalent to `hbar/2` where `hbar` is the reduced Planck constant. The matrix `S` is the Pauli matrix `sigma_y`. So, `Ay = (hbar/2) * sigma_y`.\n2.  I will use Python's `numpy` library to represent the matrices and perform calculations. For simplicity and generality, I will set `hbar = 1`, which means the eigenvalues will be `+1/2` and `-1/2`. The physical eigenvalues are these values multiplied by `hbar`.\n3.  I will calculate the eigenvalues of the `Ay` matrix. This will allow me to evaluate statements A and C, which make claims about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix like `Ay` must be real, which immediately casts doubt on A and C.\n4.  Next, I will analyze statement D. This requires defining two more operators: `A^2` (which is `Ay` squared) and `Az`.\n5.  I will calculate the eigenvectors of `Ay`.\n6.  I will then test the two claims in statement D:\n    a. I will apply the `A^2` operator to an eigenvector of `Ay` and check if the result is a scalar multiple of the original eigenvector.\n    b. I will apply the `Az` operator to the same eigenvector of `Ay` and check if the result is a scalar multiple of the original eigenvector.\n7.  Based on these calculations, I will determine which statement is correct and print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the quantum mechanics problem by:\n    1.
