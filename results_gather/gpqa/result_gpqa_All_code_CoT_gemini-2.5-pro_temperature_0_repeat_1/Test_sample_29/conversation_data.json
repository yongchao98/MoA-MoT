    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light:** The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A convenient form of this equation uses the combined constant hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm. We can rearrange this to find the wavelength: λ = hc/E.\n2.  **Identify the Color of Emitted Light:** Using the calculated wavelength, we will determine the corresponding color in the visible light spectrum.\n3.  **Determine the Absorbed Color:** The color of light a substance absorbs is complementary to the color it emits or transmits. We will use a color wheel or a list of complementary colors to find the color that was absorbed.\n4.  **Select the Correct Option:** We will match our result for the absorbed color with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_color_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the absorbed color of a compound based on its emitted light energy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define constants and given energy\n    E_emitted_eV = 2.3393  # Energy of emitted light in electron-volts (eV)\n    hc_eV_nm = 1240        # Planck's constant * speed of light, in eV·nm\n\n    # Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light\n    lambda_emitted_nm = hc_eV_nm / E_emitted_eV\n\n    print(f\"The energy of the emitted light is {E_emitted_eV} eV.\")\n    print(f\"The wavelength of the emitted light is calculated as λ = hc / E.\")\n    print(f\"λ = {hc_eV_nm} eV·nm / {E_emitted_eV} eV ≈ {lambda_emitted_nm:.2f} nm.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the color of the emitted light based on its wavelength\n    emitted_color = \"\"\n    if 495 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 570:\n        emitted_color = \"Green\"\n    elif 570 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 590:\n        emitted_color = \"Yellow\"\n    elif 620 <= lambda_emitted_nm <= 750:\n        emitted_color = \"Red\"\n    elif 450 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 495:\n        emitted_color = \"Blue\"\n    elif 380 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 450:\n        emitted_color = \"Violet\"\n    elif 590 <= lambda_emitted_nm < 620:\n        emitted_color = \"Orange\"\n    \n    if emitted_color:\n        print(f\"A wavelength of {lambda_emitted_nm:.2f} nm corresponds to the color {emitted_color}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The calculated wavelength is outside the typical visible spectrum ranges provided.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the absorbed color, which is complementary to the emitted color\n    complementary_colors = {\n        \"Red\": \"Green\",\n        \"Orange\": \"Blue\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Green\": \"Red\",\n        \"Blue\": \"Orange\",\n        \"Violet\": \"Yellow\"\n    }\n    absorbed_color = complementary_colors.get(emitted_color, \"Unknown\")\n    \n    print(f\"The color of light absorbed by a substance is complementary to the color it emits.\")\n    print(f\"The complementary color of {emitted_color} is {absorbed_color}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Select the correct option\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"Yellow\",\n        \"B\": \"Violet\",\n        \"C\": \"Blue\",\n        \"D\": \"Red\"\n    }\n    \n    final_answer_choice = \"\"\n    for choice, color in options.items():\n        if color == absorbed_color:\n            final_answer_choice = choice\n            break\n            \n    print(f\"\\nComparing our result '{absorbed_color}' with the options:\")\n    print(\"A) Yellow\")\n    print(\"B) Violet\")\n    print(\"C) Blue\")\n    print(\"D) Red\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is {final_answer_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_color_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
