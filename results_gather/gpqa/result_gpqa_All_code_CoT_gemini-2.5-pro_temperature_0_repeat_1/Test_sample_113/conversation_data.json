    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given chemical reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nReaction 1: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\nThis reaction is a nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to a ketone (butan-2-one) to form a cyanohydrin.\n*   The source of the nucleophile is Sodium Cyanide (NaCN), which provides CN⁻.\n*   The CN⁻ attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n*   This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n*   This intermediate needs to be protonated by an acid to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The reaction is typically catalyzed by acid. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbon more electrophilic for the attack by the weak nucleophile HCN (formed in situ from NaCN and the acid). Alternatively, the strong nucleophile CN- attacks first, and the resulting alkoxide is protonated. In either common mechanism, an acidic environment is required.\n*   Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, represented as H₃O⁺.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nReaction 2: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\nThis reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n*   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions, usually with heating.\n*   The options for reagent B are a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong acid (HCl).\n*   The hydrolysis of a nitrile is a slow reaction that requires a strong catalyst. A strong acid like HCl is much more effective than a weak acid like CH₃COOH for this purpose.\n*   Therefore, reagent B is HCl.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n*   From Step 1, we determined that A = H₃O⁺.\n*   From Step 2, we determined that B = HCl.\n*   Matching this with the given options:\n    *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n    *   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\n    *   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\n    *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n*   The correct option is C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions to determine the correct reagents\n    and selects the corresponding option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    # This is a cyanohydrin formation.
