    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the relative speed (v_rel):** I will use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, since both astronauts are moving in the same direction. The formula is `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`. I will substitute the given speeds `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` into this formula to find the relative speed in terms of `c`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total energy (E_total):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E1 + E2`). The relativistic energy for each astronaut is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   First, I'll calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`) for the first astronaut (mass `2m`, speed `0.6c`).\n    *   Then, I'll calculate their energy (`E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2`).\n    *   Next, I'll calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`) for the second astronaut (mass `3m`, speed `0.5c`).\n    *   Then, I'll calculate their energy (`E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2`).\n    *   Finally, I'll add `E1` and `E2` to get the total energy of the system, expressed as a multiple of `mc^2`.\n\n3.  **Compare and select the answer:** I will compare my calculated values for `v_rel` and `E_total` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# v1 and v2 are given as fractions of c\nv1_c = 0.6\nv2_c = 0.5\n# m1 and m2 are given as multiples of m\nm1_m = 2\nm2_m = 3\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel)\n# Formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)\n# In terms of c: v_rel_c = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)\nv_rel_c = (v1_c - v2_c) / (1 - v1_c * v2_c)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total energy (E_total)\n# E_total = E1 + E2 = gamma1 * m1 * c^2 + gamma2 * m2 * c^2\n# We will calculate the total energy in units of mc^2\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (gamma1)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_c**2)\n# Calculate energy for astronaut 1 in units of mc^2\nE1_mc2 = gamma1 * m1_m\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (gamma2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_c**2)\n# Calculate energy for astronaut 2 in units of mc^2\nE2_mc2 = gamma2 * m2_m\n\n# Calculate total energy in units of mc^2\nE_total_mc2 = E1_mc2 + E2_mc2\n\n# Step 3: Print the results and compare with options\nprint(\"Calculated Results:\")\nprint(f\"Relative speed (v_rel) = {v_rel_c:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy (E) = {E_total_mc2:.2f}mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nOptions:\")\nprint(\"A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\")\nprint(\"B) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\")\nprint(\"C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"D) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the calculated results with the options, the correct choice is C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
