    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n2.  **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the single-particle energy levels are `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one with spin up, +1/2, and one with spin down, -1/2).\n\n4.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_ground):** To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level, making the smallest possible energy jump.\n    *   We take one particle from the `n=2` level and move it to the `n=3` level.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n6.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):** This is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We consider the possible promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Option A:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`. The total energy is `(1 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Option B:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`. The total energy is `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   Comparing these options, the lower energy is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is `18E`.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** The energies are: Ground State = 10E, First Excited State = 15E, Second Excited State = 18E. This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_energy(particle_levels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total energy of the system based on the energy levels of the particles.\n    The energy of a particle at level n is n^2 * E.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_energy_factor = sum(n**2 for n in particle_levels)\n    return total_energy_factor\n\n# Define the energy level configurations for the four particles in each state.\n# According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, a maximum of two particles can occupy the same energy level.\n\n# Ground State: Fill the lowest energy levels.\n# 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2\nground_state_levels = [1, 1, 2, 2]\nground_state_energy = calculate_total_energy(ground_state_levels)\n\n# First Excited State: Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2)\n# to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n# 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3\nfirst_excited_state_levels = [1, 1, 2, 3]\nfirst_excited_state_energy = calculate_total_energy(first_excited_state_levels)\n\n# Second Excited State: This is the next lowest energy configuration.\n# We compare two possibilities for the next excitation from the ground state:\n# 1.
