    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the fundamental symmetries of the underlying framework, which is a local, relativistic quantum field theory. Let's break down the required symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetries (1 and 2):** These are fundamental spacetime symmetries. Any relativistic quantum field theory, including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions, must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. The combination of these is the Poincaré group. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be constructed to be invariant under these symmetries.\n\n2.  **CP Symmetry (3):** Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is known to be violated in nature, specifically within the weak sector of the Standard Model. Since SMEFT is a generalization of the SM, it not only accommodates the SM's CP violation but also provides a systematic way to parameterize new, potential sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, SMEFT operators are *not* required to conserve CP symmetry.\n\n3.  **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is built on these fundamental principles, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n```python\ndef solve_smeft_symmetries():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks to identify the fundamental symmetries that must be respected\n    # by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n    # Analysis of each symmetry:\n    # 1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry of any relativistic\n    #    quantum field theory (QFT). SMEFT is a relativistic QFT, so all its operators\n    #    must be Lorentz invariant. This is required.\n    # 2. Poincare Symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus spacetime translations.\n    #    It is the full spacetime symmetry group of relativistic QFTs. This is required.\n    # 3. CP Symmetry: This symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model's\n    #    weak interactions. SMEFT is designed to parameterize all possible effects from\n    #    new physics, including new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is\n    #    not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n    # 4. CPT Symmetry: The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in local, Lorentz-invariant\n    #    QFTs. It states that such theories must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is\n    #    formulated within this framework, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n    # Conclusion: The required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4).\n    # We now find the option that matches this conclusion.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"1,2\",\n        \"B\": \"1,2,4\",\n        \"C\": \"3,4\",\n        \"D\": \"1,3,4\"\n    }\n    correct_symmetries = [\"1.
