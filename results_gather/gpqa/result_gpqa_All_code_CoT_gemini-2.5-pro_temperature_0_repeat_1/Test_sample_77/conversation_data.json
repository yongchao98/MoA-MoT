    "This is a classic problem in electrodynamics that asks for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the core concepts:** The problem requires the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These are derived from the retarded potentials, which account for the finite speed of light, `c`. The potential at an observation point `\\vec{r}` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, \"retarded\" time `tr`.\n\n2.  **Define the retarded time:** The retarded time `tr` is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must be emitted from the charge's position `\\vec{s}(tr)` to reach the observation point `\\vec{r}` at time `t`. This is defined by the relation:\n    $t - tr = \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|}{c}$\n\n3.  **Use the problem's notation:**\n    *   The vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}(t)}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=tr}$.\n    *   The retarded time condition becomes $t - tr = d/c$, or $c(t-tr) = d$.\n\n4.  **State the general formulas for retarded potentials:** For a general charge distribution $\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)$ and current distribution $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)$, the potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', tr)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $tr = t - |\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Apply to a moving point charge:** For a point charge `q`, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions. When the integration is performed, taking into account the change in volume due to the retardation effect (the \"compression\" factor), we arrive at the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The result of this integration yields a denominator term of $(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$.\n\n6.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{tr}$\n        The subscript `tr` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\vec{d}`, `\\vec{v}`) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. We can simplify the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n        $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    *   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{tr}$\n        Similarly, simplifying the denominator:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are related to the potentials for a charge in uniform motion, but not the general case.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) Incorrect. This uses the static potential form for V.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive, which would correspond to the non-physical \"advanced\" potentials.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols used in the problem\nq, c, epsilon_o, mu_o = sympy.symbols('q c epsilon_o mu_o')\nd = sympy.Symbol('d') # magnitude of the vector d\nd_vec = sympy.Symbol(r'\\vec{d}') # vector d\nv_vec = sympy.Symbol(r'\\vec{v}') # vector v\n\n# The denominator term in the Lienard-Wiechert potentials\ndenominator = d * c - sympy.DotProduct(d_vec, v_vec)\n\n# Scalar Potential V\nV = (q * c) / (4 * sympy.pi * epsilon_o * denominator)\n\n# Vector Potential A\n# Note: The vector potential is a vector, so we represent it as a scalar multiplied by the velocity vector v_vec\nA_scalar_part = (mu_o * q * c) / (4 * sympy.pi * denominator)\nA = A_scalar_part * v_vec\n\n# The options are:\n# A) V(r,t) = q/(4*pi*epsilon_o*r), A(r,t) = v/c^2 * V(r,t)\n# B) V(r,t) = qc/(4*pi*epsilon_o*(d*c - d.v)), A(r,t) = mu_o*q*c*v/(4*pi*(d*c - d.v))\n# C) V(r,t) = q/(4*pi*epsilon_o*r), A(r,t) = v^2/c^2 * V(r,t)\n# D) V(r,t) = qc/(4*pi*epsilon_o*(d*c + d.v)), A(r,t) = mu*q*c*v/(4*pi*(d*c + d.v))\n\n# The derived expressions for V and A match option B.\ncorrect_choice = 'B'\n\nprint(f\"The scalar potential V is given by the expression: {V}\")\nprint(f\"The vector potential A is given by the expression: {A}\")\nprint(\"Comparing these with the given options, the correct choice is B.\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
