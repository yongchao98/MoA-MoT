    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. This energy decreases with the square of the distance. The formula shows that `T_eq` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(a)`, where `a` is the orbital radius (semi-major axis). Therefore, the ratio of orbital radii between two planets (`a_i / a_j`) is equal to the inverse square of the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures: `a_i / a_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^2`.\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:** According to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius (`a`), or `P^2 ‚àù a^3`. This means the ratio of orbital periods (`P_i / P_j`) is related to the ratio of their orbital radii as follows: `P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships:** By substituting the relationship from Step 1 into Step 2, we can directly relate the orbital period ratio to the temperature ratio:\n    `P_i / P_j = ((T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^2)^(3/2) = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `P3 / P1`. We can express this as the product of the intermediate ratios: `P3 / P1 = (P2 / P1) * (P3 / P2)`.\n    *   Using the formula from Step 3: `P2 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^3`.\n    *   And `P3 / P2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^3`.\n    *   Therefore, `P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^3 * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^3 = ( (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) )^3`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:** We are given `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4` and `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`. We will plug these values into the final formula to find the answer. The planet masses and the specific albedo value are not needed for the calculation, as long as the albedo is the same for all planets.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures\nT_ratio_1_over_2 = 1.4  # T_eq1 / T_eq2\nT_ratio_2_over_3 = 2.3  # T_eq2 / T_eq3\n\n# The relationship between the ratio of orbital periods (P_i / P_j) and\n# the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq_j / T_eq_i) is:\n# P_i / P_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^3\n\n# We want to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n# We can express this as (P3 / P2) * (P2 / P1).\n\n# Calculate the ratio P2 / P1\n# P2 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^3\nP_ratio_2_over_1 = T_ratio_1_over_2 ** 3\n\n# Calculate the ratio P3 / P2\n# P3 / P2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^3\nP_ratio_3_over_2 = T_ratio_2_over_3 ** 3\n\n# The final ratio P3 / P1 is the product of the two intermediate ratios.\n# P3 / P1 = (P2 / P1) * (P3 / P2)\n# This is equivalent to ((T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3))^3\nfinal_ratio = P_ratio_2_over_1 * P_ratio_3_over_2\n\n# An alternative and more direct calculation:\n# T_ratio_1_over_3 = T_ratio_1_over_2 * T_ratio_2_over_3\n# P_ratio_3_over_1 = (T_ratio_1_over_3)**3\n# final_ratio = (T_ratio_1_over_2 * T_ratio_2_over_3) ** 3\n\nprint(f\"The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of: {final_ratio:.1f}\")\nprint(\"Comparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 33.4\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 3.2\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 4.4\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 10.4\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
