    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid** before dilution.\n2.  **Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid** after being diluted with water. The number of moles of acid remains the same, but the total volume increases.\n3.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration**. This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`.\n    *   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains. The ratio `[A⁻]/[HA]` will be `0.25 / 0.75`.\n4.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point**.\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate.\n    *   First, determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution (diluted acid + added NaOH).\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion in this total volume.\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions. We need to calculate the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate using the formula `Kb = Kw / Ka`, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis of acetate to find the [OH⁻].\n    *   Calculate the pOH from the [OH⁻], and then find the pH using `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n5.  **Print the calculated pH values** and compare them to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial values\nvol_acid_initial_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_acid_initial_M = 0.05\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_naoh_M = 0.1\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Convert volumes to Liters\nvol_acid_initial_L = vol_acid_initial_cm3 / 1000\nvol_water_L = vol_water_cm3 / 1000\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the concentration of the diluted acid\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_initial_M * vol_acid_initial_L\nvol_acid_diluted_L = vol_acid_initial_L + vol_water_L\nconc_acid_diluted_M = moles_acid / vol_acid_diluted_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate pH at 25% titration\n# Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = 0.25 / 0.75\nratio_25 = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_25)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate pH at the equivalence point\n# At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base\nmoles_naoh_eq = moles_acid\nvol_naoh_eq_L = moles_naoh_eq / conc_naoh_M\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nvol_total_eq_L = vol_acid_diluted_L + vol_naoh_eq_L\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, A-) at equivalence point\nconc_A_minus_eq_M = moles_acid / vol_total_eq_L\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb_base = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of A-: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / (conc_A_minus - x)\n# We can approximate that x is small, so Kb ≈ x^2 / conc_A_minus\n# x = [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_base * conc_A_minus_eq_M)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH_eq\n\n# Step 5: Print the results\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(\"B) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(\"C) 3.17; 6.73\")\nprint(\"D) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
