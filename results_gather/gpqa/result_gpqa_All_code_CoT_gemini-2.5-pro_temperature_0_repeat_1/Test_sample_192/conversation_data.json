    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** Parallax (`plx`) is the apparent shift in the position of a star against a distant background as observed from two different points in Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to the star. Mathematically, `plx = 1/r`.\n2.  **State the given information.** We are told that the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n3.  **Determine the goal.** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, depends on the distance `r`.\n4.  **Use the chain rule.** The chain rule connects the rates of change: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`.\n5.  **Calculate `d(plx)/dr`**. We differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`. This gives `d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2`. Since we are interested in the proportionality and how the number changes (a positive quantity), we can consider the magnitude, which is proportional to `1/r^2`.\n6.  **Combine the proportionalities.** We substitute the known proportionalities into the chain rule equation:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n7.  **Express everything in terms of `r`**. We replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Step 1: Define the symbols for distance (r) and parallax (plx).\nr, plx = sp.symbols('r plx')\n\n# Step 2: Define the relationship between parallax and distance.\n# plx = 1/r\nrelation_r_plx = 1/r\n\n# Step 3: Define the given proportionality for the number of stars per unit parallax.\n# dN/d(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^5. We can represent this as k/plx^5.\n# For proportionality, we can set the constant k=1.\ndN_dplx = 1 / plx**5\n\n# Step 4: Use the chain rule to find dN/dr.\n# The chain rule is dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).\n# First, find the derivative of plx with respect to r.\ndplx_dr = sp.diff(relation_r_plx, r)\n\n# The number of stars is a positive quantity, so we are interested in the magnitude of the change.\n# We use the absolute value of the derivative.\ndN_dr = dN_dplx * abs(dplx_dr)\n\n# Step 5: Substitute the expression for plx (in terms of r) into the equation for dN/dr.\n# This will give us the final relationship solely in terms of distance r.\ndN_dr_in_terms_of_r = dN_dr.subs(plx, relation_r_plx)\n\n# Step 6: Simplify the final expression to see the proportionality.\nfinal_proportionality = sp.simplify(dN_dr_in_terms_of_r)\n\n# Step 7: Print the result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(\"The number of stars per unit range of distance (dN/dr) is proportional to:\")\nprint(final_proportionality)\nprint(\"\\nThis corresponds to the relationship ~ r^3.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ r^2\")\nprint(\"B) ~ r^4\")\nprint(\"C) ~ r^3\")\nprint(\"D) ~ r^5\")\nprint(\"\\nChoice: C\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
