    "To solve this problem, we will use the energy-time uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or spread in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical purposes in spectroscopy, we often approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where ΔE represents the natural linewidth or energy width of the state, and Δt is its lifetime (τ).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Constants:** We'll use the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n2.  **Calculate Energy Uncertainty:** For each state, we will calculate its energy uncertainty (ΔE) using the formula ΔE = ħ / τ, where τ is the given lifetime.\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable or \"resolved,\" the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than their combined energy uncertainties. A good criterion is that the energy difference |E1 - E2| should be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2).\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will calculate this minimum required energy separation and compare it with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find which one satisfies the condition.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and determine the correct option.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the necessary constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n# Lifetime of the first state in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\n# Lifetime of the second state in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"The energy uncertainty for the first state (lifetime {tau1} s) is: {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The energy uncertainty for the second state (lifetime {tau2} s) is: {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Step 3: Determine the minimum energy separation required for resolution\n# For the levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater\n# than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\nprint(f\"\\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.\")\nprint(f\"Required energy separation > {delta_E1:.3e} eV + {delta_E2:.3e} eV = {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Step 4: Compare the required separation with the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nEvaluating the options:\")\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference because it is greater than {required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n        correct_option = option\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference because it is less than or equal to {required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nBased on the calculations, the only energy difference large enough to resolve the two states is Option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
