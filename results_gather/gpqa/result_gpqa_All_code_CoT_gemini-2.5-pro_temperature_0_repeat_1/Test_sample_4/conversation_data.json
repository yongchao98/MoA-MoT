    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Operator**: The problem asks for the eigenvector of the operator $\\vec{P}$ along a direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. This operator, let's call it $P_n$, is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n2.  **Define Components**: The components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x$, $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y$, and $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z$, where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle $\\theta$ as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n3.  **Construct the Operator Matrix**: We can now construct the matrix for $P_n$:\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$.\n    Substituting the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$, we get:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Problem**: We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where the eigenvalue is given as $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector**: The equation becomes $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\psi\\rangle$. We can cancel the $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ factor, which means we need to find the eigenvector of the matrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1$.\n6.  **Use Python to Calculate**: I will write a Python script to solve this eigenvalue problem. The script will define the matrix $M$ and then calculate its eigenvectors. By solving the system of linear equations derived from the eigenvalue problem and normalizing the result, we can determine the components of the eigenvector.\n7.  **Compare and Conclude**: The calculated components of the normalized eigenvector will be compared against the given multiple-choice options to identify the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, cos, Symbol, Matrix\n\ndef solve_eigenvector_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator\n    and identifies the correct choice from a list of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix M\n    # for the eigenvalue +1, where M is defined as:\n    # M = [[cos(theta), sin(theta)],\n    #      [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]]\n    # Let the eigenvector be [a, b].
