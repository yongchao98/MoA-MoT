    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct formula for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nTo solve this electrostatics problem, we can use a powerful technique called the \"method of images\". The core idea is to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conducting sphere with a simpler, equivalent problem involving only point charges.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field outside the sphere is identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge is placed inside the sphere at a specific location `b` such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at `r=R`) is zero.\n\nThe image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center) are given by:\n*   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n**2. Potential Energy as Work Done**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the total work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where potential energy is zero) to its final position at distance `d` from the center. This work is done against the electric force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere's surface. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Force**\n\nLet's consider the charge `q` at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center as it's being brought in from infinity. At this position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on charge `q` due to the image charge `q'(x)` is given by Coulomb's law:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2`\nThe distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nSo, the force is:\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n**4. Integrating to Find Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work done by this electric field as the charge moves from infinity to `d`.\n`U = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫[from ∞ to d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫[from ∞ to d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\nThe integral becomes:\n`∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]` (from `x = ∞` to `x = d`)\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ( [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))] )`\nThe term with infinity in the denominator goes to zero.\n\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ( -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) )`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived formula with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks to identify the correct formula for the potential energy\n# of a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere.\n# The derivation above, using the method of images and calculating the work done,\n# leads to the following formula:\n# U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\n# Let's print the given options and then the correct choice.\n\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nprint(\"A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\")\nprint(\"B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\")\nprint(\"C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\")\nprint(\"D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\")\nprint(\"\\nBased on the physical derivation, the correct formula is the one in option C.\")\nprint(\"The correct choice is: C\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
