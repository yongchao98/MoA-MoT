    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of the final product by following the reaction sequence step-by-step. Then, we will analyze the symmetry of the final molecule to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂):** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This yields **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat:** This is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. The strong base (NaOH) removes a proton from the other α-carbon, forming an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbon with the bromine, displacing it and forming a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to ring-opening and contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring. The product is **Product 2: cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine:** This reaction converts a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The -OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a -Cl atom. This forms **Product 3: cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(O-t-Bu)₃H):** This is a mild and bulky reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol. This gives the final **Product 4: cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\n\nNow we need to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the carbon of the ring it is attached to (C1).\n*   This symmetry makes the carbons and hydrogens on one side of the plane equivalent to those on the other side.\n\nLet's count the unique sets of hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 set)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 set)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by rotation or symmetry). This means the two hydrogens on C2 are in different environments from each other. The \"inner\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the \"outer\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives us 2 distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 sets)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives us another 2 distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 sets)\n\nTotal number of distinct hydrogen sets = 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step synthesis and analysis\n    to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens in the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the reaction sequence and products.\n    product_1 = \"2-bromocyclohexanone\"\n    product_2 = \"cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (from Favorskii rearrangement)\"\n    product_3 = \"cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\"\n    product_4 = \"cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\"\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, for chemically distinct hydrogens.\n    # The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the C1-CHO bond.\n    # H sets are counted based on their unique chemical environments.\n    \n    # Set 1: The aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    set_1_aldehyde_H = 1\n    \n    # Set 2: The proton on C1 of the ring (the carbon attached to the aldehyde).\n    set_2_C1_H = 1\n    \n    # Sets 3 & 4: The protons on C2 and C5.
