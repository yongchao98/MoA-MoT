    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the directing effect of each substituent on the benzene ring during electrophilic bromination and how these effects influence the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** Each substituent will be classified based on its electronic effect (activating or deactivating) and its directing effect (ortho/para-directing or meta-directing).\n2.  **Analyze Meta-Directors:** Meta-directing groups produce very small amounts of the ortho and para isomers. The yield of the para-isomer will be extremely low. We will rank these groups based on their deactivating strength: the stronger the deactivator, the lower the yield of any non-meta product.\n3.  **Analyze Ortho, Para-Directors:** Ortho, para-directing groups produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced by steric hindrance (larger groups favor the less-crowded para position) and electronic factors.\n4.  **Combine and Rank:** We will combine the two groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors. We will then establish the final order of increasing para-isomer yield.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be created to formalize this logic. We will assign a \"para-yield score\" to each substance based on the chemical principles above and then sort the substances according to this score to find the correct order.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (very low para yield):** -NO₂, -COOH, -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Deactivating strength: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: -NO₂ < -COOH < -COOC₂H₅ (4 < 6 < 2).\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (higher para yield):** -CH₃, -C₂H₅, -Cl.\n    *   -CH₃ and -C₂H₅ are activating. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is larger than the methyl group (-CH₃), so it will have greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product. Thus, para yield: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅ (1 < 5).\n    *   -Cl is deactivating but ortho, para-directing. Halogens are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer due to a combination of electronic and steric effects. The para yield for chlorobenzene is significantly higher than for toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para yield is: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl (1 < 5 < 3).\n\n*   **Final Combined Order:** Combining the two groups gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n    4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe following Python code will sort the substances based on this logic and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by assigning a score based on chemical principles\n    and then sorting the substances.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the substances and the chemical principles for ranking.\n    # The ranking is based on the expected yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic bromination.\n    # A higher score corresponds to a higher expected para-isomer yield.\n\n    # Meta-directors have the lowest para yield.\n    # The stronger the deactivating group, the lower the yield.\n    # Deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5\n    # So, para yield order: 4 < 6 < 2\n\n    # Ortho, para-directors have higher para yield.\n    # The order is determined by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    # Steric hindrance: C2H5 > CH3, so para yield for C2H5 > CH3.\n    # Halogens (Cl) give a very high para/ortho ratio.\n    # So, para yield order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\n    # Combining gives the full order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n    \n    # We assign a numerical score to represent this order.\n    para_yield_scores = {\n        1: 4,  # C6H5-CH3: o,p-director, moderate para yield\n        2: 3,  # C6H5-COOC2H5: meta-director, very low para yield\n        3: 6,  # C6H5-Cl: o,p-director, highest para yield\n        4: 1,  # C6H5-NO2: meta-director, lowest para yield\n        5: 5,  # C6H5-C2H5: o,p-director, high para yield (more than CH3)\n        6: 2,  # C6H5-COOH: meta-director, very low para yield (more than NO2)\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the substance IDs based on their assigned scores.\n    # The `sorted` function's `key` argument looks up the score for each item.\n    sorted_ids = sorted(para_yield_scores, key=para_yield_scores.get)\n\n    # Step 3: Format the output string.\n    order_string = \"<\".join(map(str, sorted_ids))\n    \n    # Step 4: Identify the correct option from the list.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"6<2<4<5<1<3\",\n        \"B\": \"4<2<6<3<1<5\",\n        \"C\": \"4<6<2<1<5<3\",\n        \"D\": \"3<5<1<6<2<4\"\n    }\n\n    correct_option = \"Unknown\"\n    for option, value in options.items():\n        if value == order_string:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    # Step 5: Print the results.\n    print(\"The substances arranged in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer are:\")\n    print(order_string)\n    print(f\"\\nThis order corresponds to option: {correct_option}\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_order()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
