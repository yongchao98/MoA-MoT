    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles**: First, we'll calculate the number of moles for each compound (KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O) by dividing their mass by their respective molar mass. These values directly correspond to the moles of the H2PO4- and HPO4^2- ions.\n2.  **Calculate Concentrations**: Next, we'll find the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2- by dividing the moles of each by the total volume of the solution in liters (200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L).\n3.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]**: The solution is a buffer system governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-), which is described by the equilibrium constant Ka2. We will rearrange the Ka2 expression to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+].\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]**: Finally, we'll use the third dissociation equilibrium (HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-), described by Ka3. By rearranging the Ka3 expression and using the previously calculated values for [H+] and [HPO4^2-], we can determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-].\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\n\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # Convert cm3 (mL) to L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles of the buffer components ---\n# Moles of KH2PO4 gives moles of H2PO4-\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n\n# Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O gives moles of HPO4^2-\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations ---\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate hydrogen ion concentration [H+] ---\n# From the equilibrium: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] ---\n# From the equilibrium: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# --- Print the results ---\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) is: {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option D.\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
