    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final quantum states.** The initial state is the coupled angular momentum state `|l1, l2, l, m>`, and the final state is the uncoupled state `|l1, m1; l2, m2>` corresponding to the measurement outcome.\n2.  **Extract the quantum numbers.** From the problem description, the initial state is `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, so `l1=1`, `l2=1`, `l=2`, and `m=-1`. The measurement outcome is eigenvalues of `-ħ` for both `L1z` and `L2z`, which corresponds to `m1=-1` and `m2=-1`.\n3.  **Apply the rules of angular momentum coupling.** The probability of this measurement is the square of the absolute value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which represents the projection of the initial state onto the final state: `P = |<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>|^2`.\n4.  **Use the selection rule for the magnetic quantum number.** A fundamental property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless the magnetic quantum numbers add up, i.e., `m1 + m2 = m`.\n5.  **Calculate and conclude.** I will check if this selection rule is satisfied for the given quantum numbers. If it is not, the probability is zero.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_angular_momentum_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the joint probability for measuring the z-components of angular momentum\n    for two electrons in a coupled state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the quantum numbers from the problem.\n    # Initial coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>\n    l1 = 1\n    l2 = 1\n    l = 2\n    m = -1\n\n    # The measurement outcome corresponds to eigenvalues of -ħ for L1z and L2z.\n    # The eigenvalue of Lz is m_q * ħ, so we are looking for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n    m1 = -1\n    m2 = -1\n\n    print(f\"Initial state quantum numbers: l1={l1}, l2={l2}, l={l}, m={m}\")\n    print(f\"Measured outcome quantum numbers: m1={m1}, m2={m2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Apply the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    # The probability is non-zero only if m1 + m2 = m.\n    # This is because the z-component of the total angular momentum operator\n    # is the sum of the individual operators: Lz = L1z + L2z.\n    # Therefore, the corresponding quantum numbers must also sum up.\n    m_sum = m1 + m2\n\n    print(f\"Checking the selection rule: m1 + m2 = m\")\n    print(f\"Sum of measured magnetic quantum numbers: m1 + m2 = {m1} + ({m2}) = {m_sum}\")\n    print(f\"Total magnetic quantum number of the initial state: m = {m}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the probability and determine the answer.\n    if m_sum == m:\n        # This case would require calculating the specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n        # However, for this problem, the condition is not met.\n        probability = \"Non-zero (requires further calculation)\"\n        is_zero = False\n    else:\n        probability = 0\n        is_zero = True\n\n    print(f\"\\nIs the selection rule satisfied? {'Yes' if not is_zero else 'No'}.\")\n    print(f\"Since {m_sum} != {m}, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0.\")\n    print(f\"The joint probability is the square of this coefficient, which is {probability}.\")\n\n    # Match the result with the given options.\n    options = {'A': '2/3', 'B': '1', 'C': '0', 'D': '1/2'}\n    final_choice = 'C'\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(f\"The calculated probability is {options[final_choice]}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option: {final_choice}\")\n\nsolve_angular_momentum_probability()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
