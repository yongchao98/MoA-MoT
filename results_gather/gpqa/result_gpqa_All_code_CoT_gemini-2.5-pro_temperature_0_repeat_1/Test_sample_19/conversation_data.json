    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the impulse approximation. It's a model where a high-energy interaction with a nucleus is treated as a sum of interactions with individual, quasi-free nucleons.\n2.  Evaluate each of the four given assumptions against this definition.\n    *   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the fundamental basis of the approximation. We are breaking down a many-body problem into a series of single-body problems. This is essential.\n    *   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption means we ignore \"final-state interactions,\" where the struck nucleon or the probe particle re-scatters off other nucleons on its way out. In the simplest form of the impulse approximation, this is assumed, so the final state is easy to interpret. This is essential.\n    *   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This is an assumption about the *internal structure* of the nucleon, not its behavior *within the nucleus*. The impulse approximation can be applied regardless of the model used for the nucleon's internal structure (e.g., relativistic quark models). Therefore, this is not a required assumption for the impulse approximation itself.\n    *   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. The idea is that the interaction happens so quickly (high momentum transfer) that the potential energy from the binding forces is negligible during the brief moment of the collision. The nucleon is effectively \"free\" at the instant of interaction. This is essential.\n3.  Conclude that the necessary assumptions are 1, 2, and 4.\n4.  Match this combination with the given options. The combination (1, 2, 4) corresponds to option A.\n5.  Write a Python script to print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_physics_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the assumptions behind the impulse approximation in nuclear physics.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply the 'impulse' approximation?\"\n    \n    assumptions = {\n        1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\",\n        2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\",\n        3: \"The quarks internal to theselected nucleon are non-relativistic.\",\n        4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"\n    }\n    \n    options = {\n        \"A\": [1, 2, 4],\n        \"B\": [1, 3, 4],\n        \"C\": [1, 2, 3],\n        \"D\": [2, 3, 4]\n    }\n\n    # Explanation of the impulse approximation\n    print(\"Analyzing the Impulse Approximation:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    print(\"The impulse approximation simplifies high-energy interactions with a nucleus by treating the interaction as a collision with a single, quasi-free nucleon.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's evaluate the given assumptions:\")\n    \n    # Evaluation of each assumption\n    print(f\"1.
