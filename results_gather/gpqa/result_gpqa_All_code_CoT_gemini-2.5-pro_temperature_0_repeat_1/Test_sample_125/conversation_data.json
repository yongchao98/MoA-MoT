    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** Identify the starting material, reagents, and the stereochemical outcome of the reaction to determine the product(s).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** Similarly, identify the starting material, reagents, and the stereochemical outcome to determine the product(s).\n3.  **Combine Products:** List all unique chemical compounds present in the final mixture.\n4.  **Normal-Phase HPLC Analysis:** Determine how many distinct peaks the combined mixture will show on a normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column. Remember that normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity and cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n5.  **Chiral HPLC Analysis:** Determine how many distinct peaks the same mixture will show on a chiral HPLC column. Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Match the calculated number of peaks to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n*   **Reaction I:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. The reduction of the ketone at C-3 with the achiral reagent LAH creates a new chiral center. This results in the formation of two products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n*   **Reaction II:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. The reduction of both ketone groups with NaBH4 creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4. This reaction produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and a **meso compound**, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral):** This technique separates compounds with different physical properties (like polarity) but cannot separate enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable and will appear as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will separate, giving another **1 peak**. This is a total of 2 peaks from Reaction II's products.\n    *   The products of Reaction I are structurally different from the products of Reaction II, so they will all be separated from each other.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n    *   Since there are five unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. This matches option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC experiments.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n\n    # Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH -> (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    # These two products are diastereomers.\n    reaction_I_products = [\"(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\", \"(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\"]\n\n    # Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione + NaBH4 -> (2R, 4R)-, (2S, 4S)-, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    # This produces a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    reaction_II_products = [\"(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer A)\", \"(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer B)\", \"meso-pentane-2,4-diol\"]\n\n    # Total unique stereoisomers in the final mixture\n    total_stereoisomers = len(reaction_I_products) + len(reaction_II_products)\n\n    # --- HPLC Peak Calculation ---\n\n    # Normal-Phase HPLC (achiral separation)\n    # - Diastereomers are separable.\n    # - Enantiomers are not separable.\n    # - Products from Rxn I are two diastereomers -> 2 peaks.\n    # - Products from Rxn II are a pair of enantiomers (1 peak) and a meso compound (1 peak, as it's a diastereomer to the pair) -> 2 peaks.\n    # Total normal-phase peaks = 2 + 2 = 4\n    normal_phase_peaks = 4\n\n    # Chiral HPLC (chiral separation)\n    # - Separates all unique stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers).\n    # - The number of peaks equals the total number of unique stereoisomers.\n    chiral_hplc_peaks = total_stereoisomers # which is 5\n\n    # --- Conclusion ---\n    print(\"Analysis of the Reactions and HPLC Separation:\")\n    print(f\"Reaction I produces {len(reaction_I_products)} products (diastereomers).\")\n    print(f\"Reaction II produces {len(reaction_II_products)} products (an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound).\")\n    print(f\"Total unique stereoisomers in the mixture: {total_stereoisomers}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral):\")\n    print(\" - Separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\")\n    print(f\" - Expected peaks: {normal_phase_peaks}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Chiral HPLC:\")\n    print(\" - Separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\")\n    print(f\" - Expected peaks: {chiral_hplc_peaks}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: {chiral_hplc_peaks} Peaks in chiral HPLC and {normal_phase_peaks} peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```"
