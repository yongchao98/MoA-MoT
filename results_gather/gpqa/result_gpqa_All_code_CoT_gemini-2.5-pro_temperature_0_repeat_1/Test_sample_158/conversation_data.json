    "The user wants to find the comoving distance to a quasar given its spectral features and a specific cosmological model.\n\n**My thinking process is as follows:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes a peak in the quasar's spectrum at 790 nm, with a sharp drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from the quasar, with the flux drop caused by the Lyman-alpha forest (absorption by neutral hydrogen clouds between us and the quasar). The peak wavelength corresponds to the redshifted Lyα line.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z):**\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (`λ_rest`) is approximately 121.6 nm.\n    *   The observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) is given as 790 nm.\n    *   The redshift `z` is defined by the formula: `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`.\n    *   Therefore, `z = (790 / 121.6) - 1`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Formula:** The problem asks for the comoving distance in a flat Lambda-CDM universe. The formula for this is:\n    `D_c = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')`\n    where:\n    *   `D_H` is the Hubble distance, `c / H₀`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `H₀` is the Hubble constant.\n    *   `E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ)`, where `Ω_m` is the matter density parameter and `Ω_Λ` is the dark energy density parameter.\n\n4.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    *   I will use the provided cosmological parameters: `H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹`, `Ω_m = 0.3`, `Ω_Λ = 0.7`.\n    *   The calculation involves a definite integral, which is best solved numerically. I will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function for this purpose.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   Import necessary libraries (`numpy` for math functions, `scipy.integrate` for the integral).\n    *   Define all the constants: `λ_obs`, `λ_rest`, `H₀`, `Ω_m`, `Ω_Λ`, and `c`.\n    *   Calculate the redshift `z`.\n    *   Define the function `E(z)` and the integrand `1 / E(z)`.\n    *   Use `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the integral from 0 to `z`.\n    *   Calculate the final comoving distance `D_c` in Megaparsecs (Mpc) and then convert it to Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n    *   Compare the calculated value to the given options (A, B, C, D) and determine the closest one.\n    *   Print the final result and the chosen option.\n\nThis step-by-step plan will allow me to accurately calculate the comoving distance and select the correct answer from the provided choices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
