    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of the Signal:** The problem describes two scenarios that produce a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n    *   **Stellar Spots:** A hemisphere covered in cooler, darker spots rotates into view, reducing the total light emitted towards the observer. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. The amplitude of this variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux.\n    *   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star, blocking a fraction of the star's light. The amplitude of this signal (the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Spot Signal Amplitude:**\n    *   The flux (brightness) of a radiating body is proportional to its area and the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: `Flux ∝ Area * T⁴`).\n    *   Let `F_max` be the flux from the unspotted hemisphere. This is proportional to `A_disk * T_eff⁴`, where `A_disk` is the area of the star's visible disk and `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   Let `F_min` be the flux from the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spots` of its area covered by spots at temperature `T_spots` and the remaining fraction `(1 - f_spots)` at `T_eff`. So, `F_min` is proportional to `(1 - f_spots) * A_disk * T_eff⁴ + f_spots * A_disk * T_spots⁴`.\n    *   The relative amplitude of the spot signal is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`. By substituting the formulas and simplifying, this becomes `f_spots * (1 - (T_spots / T_eff)⁴)`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Planet Signal Amplitude:**\n    *   The transit depth is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. This is simply the ratio of their projected areas: `(Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n\n4.  **Equate and Solve:**\n    *   The problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude. Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other: `(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spots * (1 - (T_spots / T_eff)⁴)`.\n    *   To find the desired ratio `R_pl / R_star`, we take the square root of the right-hand side.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   I will define the given parameters: `T_eff`, the temperature difference, and the spot filling factor `f_spots`.\n    *   I will calculate `T_spots`.\n    *   I will then compute the value of `(R_pl / R_star)` using the derived formula.\n    *   Finally, I will compare the calculated result with the given options (A, B, C, D) to determine the correct choice and print it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_exoplanet_radius_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (relative to its star)\n    that would produce the same brightness variation as a spotted star.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    T_eff_star = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\n    temp_diff_spots = 1000  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\n    f_spots = 0.20  # Filling factor of the spots (20%)\n\n    # Calculate the temperature of the spots\n    T_spots = T_eff_star - temp_diff_spots\n\n    # The amplitude of the signal due to rotational modulation of spots is given by:\n    # Amplitude_spots = f_spots * (1 - (T_spots / T_eff_star)**4)\n    amplitude_spots = f_spots * (1 - (T_spots / T_eff_star)**4)\n\n    # The amplitude of the signal due to an exoplanet transit (transit depth) is:\n    # Amplitude_planet = (R_planet / R_star)**2\n    # We are given that Amplitude_spots = Amplitude_planet.\n    # So, (R_planet / R_star)**2 = amplitude_spots\n\n    # Solve for the ratio R_planet / R_star\n    radius_ratio = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\n    # Print the calculated result and the options\n    print(f\"The calculated radius ratio (R_pl / R_star) is: {radius_ratio:.4f}\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\n    print(f\"A) ~0.11\")\n    print(f\"B) ~0.39\")\n    print(f\"C) ~0.32\")\n    print(f\"D) ~0.07\")\n\n    # Determine the closest option\n    options = {'A': 0.11, 'B': 0.39, 'C': 0.32, 'D': 0.07}\n    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - radius_ratio))\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {closest_option}\")\n\nsolve_exoplanet_radius_ratio()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
