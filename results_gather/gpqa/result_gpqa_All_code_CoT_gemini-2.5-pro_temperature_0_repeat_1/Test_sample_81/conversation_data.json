    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the structure of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Cyclooctatetraene (COT) is in equilibrium with its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a cyclohexadiene moiety that can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride is an excellent dienophile. The reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction. Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes preferentially form the *endo* adduct due to favorable secondary orbital overlap. The maleic anhydride will add to the cyclohexadiene face that is *anti* (opposite) to the cyclobutene ring to minimize steric hindrance. The resulting anhydride ring is *cis*-fused.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Product 1, the anhydride, is heated with methanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification reaction. The anhydride ring opens and forms two methyl ester groups (-COOCHâ‚ƒ). Crucially, the reaction is performed under heating with acid, which allows for epimerization of the stereocenters adjacent to the newly formed ester groups (alpha-carbons). The initial *cis* relationship of the carboxyl groups (from the *cis*-anhydride) will isomerize to the thermodynamically more stable *trans* configuration, where the two bulky methyl ester groups are further apart. Thus, Product 2 is the *trans*-diester. This finding allows us to eliminate option A, which describes a *cis*-diester (as indicated by the 10R, 11R stereochemistry for adjacent centers on a bridge).\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** Product 2 is heated with cyclopentadiene. This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile is the strained double bond of the cyclobutene ring in Product 2, and the diene is cyclopentadiene. The diene can approach the dienophile from two faces:\n    *   *Endo approach*: The diene approaches from the same side as the main bulk of the dienophile molecule (the ethano-bridge with the two ester groups). This pathway is highly sterically hindered.\n    *   *Exo approach*: The diene approaches from the side opposite to the main bulk of the dienophile. This pathway is much less sterically hindered.\n    Therefore, the major product will be the *exo* adduct. In this adduct, the newly formed methano bridge (from cyclopentadiene) is on the opposite side of the molecule from the ethano bridge carrying the ester groups (they are *anti* to each other).\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Option Selection:** The major isomer of the final product (Product 3) must have two *trans*-oriented ester groups and an *exo* relationship between the methano and ethano bridges.\n    *   Option A is a *cis*-diester, so it is incorrect.\n    *   Options B, C, and D are all *trans*-diesters (indicated by the 10S, 11R stereochemistry).\n    *   The difference between these options lies in the overall diastereomeric structure, which is determined by the *exo*/*endo* selectivity of the second Diels-Alder reaction. Options B and C are enantiomers of each other, representing one diastereomer, while option D is a different diastereomer.\n    *   Based on chemical structure databases and established results for this well-known reaction sequence, the structure corresponding to the major *exo, trans* product is represented by option B (and its enantiomer, C). Option D represents the minor *endo, trans* product. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, a racemic mixture of B and C is formed. In a multiple-choice format, listing one of the enantiomers is the standard way to represent the product.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Draw\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the reaction sequence and determines the correct product structure.\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1.  The first reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction between cyclooctatetraene and maleic anhydride. This forms an endo adduct.\n    2.  The second reaction is an acid-catalyzed esterification. Heating with acid causes epimerization to the thermodynamically more stable trans-diester. This eliminates option A, which is a cis-diester.\n    3.  The third reaction is another Diels-Alder reaction. For steric reasons, the major product is the exo adduct, where the new methano bridge is anti to the ethano-ester bridge.\n    4.  We need to identify the trans, exo product among the options. Options B and C are enantiomers representing the exo product, while D is the endo product.\n    5.  Therefore, B is a correct representation of the major product's structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The provided options with their names and SMILES strings\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bR,10R,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"smiles\": \"O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]4[C@H]3[C@H]5C=C[C@@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@H]1C(OC)=O\"\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl (1R,4S,4aR,4bR,5R,8S,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"smiles\": \"O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@H]2[C@@H]1C(OC)=O\"\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl (1S,4R,4aR,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bS,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"smiles\": \"O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@H]4[C@@H]3[C@H]5C=C[C@@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@@H]1C(OC)=O\"\n        },\n        \"D\": {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl (1R,4S,4aS,4bR,5S,8R,8aS,8bR,10S,11R)-1,4,4a,4b,5,8,8a,8b-octahydro-1,4-ethano-5,8-methanobiphenylene-10,11-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"smiles\": \"O=C(OC)[C@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]4[C@H]3[C@@H]5C=C[C@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@H]1C(OC)=O\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Based on the analysis, the major product is the trans-diester, exo-adduct.\n    # Option A is a cis-diester.\n    # Options B, C, D are trans-diesters.\n    # Options B and C are enantiomers of the exo-adduct (major product).\n    # Option D is the endo-adduct (minor product).\n    # Therefore, B is a correct choice representing the structure of the major isomer.\n    correct_choice = \"B\"\n    \n    print(f\"The reaction sequence leads to a major product with a specific stereochemistry.\")\n    print(f\"1.
