    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and observations:**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered to the gut.\n    *   **Location:** The immune response is observed in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine.\n    *   **Cellular Response:** A specific cell population is proliferating, which indicates clonal expansion after recognizing the antigen.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** Sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells reveals *high variability*.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the provided options against the key observation:** The most critical piece of information is the \"high variability\" found in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of *proliferating* cells within a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process alters the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the *variable* region. It's responsible for changing an antibody's class (e.g., from IgM to IgA), but not its antigen-binding site variability.\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of proteins in the blood. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells.\n    *   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse repertoire of variable regions in developing B cells. However, it occurs in the bone marrow *before* the B cell encounters an antigen. The scenario describes a process happening *after* antigen encounter in proliferating cells.\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process specifically introduces point mutations into the DNA of the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers (found in Peyer's patches). This leads to \"high variability\" and is a key mechanism for affinity maturation, where antibodies with higher binding strength to the antigen are selected.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\nThe following Python code will systematically evaluate these options based on the key facts from the scenario to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_immunology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the biological scenario to determine the correct process.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key observations from the experiment\n    observations = {\n        \"location\": \"Peyer's patch (secondary lymphoid organ)\",\n        \"cell_activity\": \"proliferating after antigen exposure\",\n        \"genetic_locus\": \"variable heavy chain gene\",\n        \"genetic_effect\": \"high variability\"\n    }\n\n    # Definitions of the possible biological processes\n    processes = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"Class switching recombination\",\n            \"description\": \"Changes the CONSTANT region of the heavy chain, not the variable region.\",\n            \"matches\": False\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"Complement activation\",\n            \"description\": \"A protein cascade in the innate immune system, not a genetic modification of B cells.\",\n            \"matches\": False\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"name\": \"VDJ recombination\",\n            \"description\": \"Creates initial diversity in the variable region BEFORE antigen exposure in the bone marrow.\",\n            \"matches\": False\n        },\n        \"D\": {\n            \"name\": \"Somatic hypermutation\",\n            \"description\": \"Introduces high variability into the VARIABLE region of proliferating B cells AFTER antigen exposure in secondary lymphoid organs.\",\n            \"matches\": True # This process matches all key observations.\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the experimental evidence:\")\n    print(f\"- The process occurs in proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch, which is a secondary lymphoid organ.\")\n    print(f\"- It causes 'high variability' specifically in the 'variable heavy chain gene'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Evaluating the options:\")\n\n    correct_choice = None\n    for choice, details in processes.items():\n        print(f\"{choice}) {details['name']}: {details['description']}\")\n        if details['matches']:\n            correct_choice = choice\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The only process that matches all observations is {processes[correct_choice]['name']}.\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is: {correct_choice}\")\n\nsolve_immunology_question()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
