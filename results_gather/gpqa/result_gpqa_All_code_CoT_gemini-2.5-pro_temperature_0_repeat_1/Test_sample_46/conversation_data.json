    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Given the molecular formula contains two oxygens and the NMR data (see below), this is very likely an ester group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals (a triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester (forming an ethoxy group, -O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded (downfield) because they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOR). The protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded (upfield) because they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH2).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Structure and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the molecule consists of a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n        *   B) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n        *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n        *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this isomer, the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH2CH3). The NMR quartet would be next to the carbonyl, appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the spectral data for C9H11NO2:\")\n    \n    # 1.
