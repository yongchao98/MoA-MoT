    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles.** The solution requires combining two key laws:\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius (r). So, P² ∝ r³.\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** A planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. This relationship shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius (T_eq ∝ 1/√r), assuming the same stellar luminosity and planetary albedo.\n\n2.  **Derive the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period.**\n    *   From Kepler's Law: r ∝ P^(2/3).\n    *   From the equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2).\n    *   By substituting the expression for 'r' into the temperature formula, we get: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3).\n    *   This means the ratio of two planets' equilibrium temperatures is (T_eq_A / T_eq_B) = (P_A / P_B)^(-1/3).\n\n3.  **Apply the derived relationship to the specific planets.**\n    *   We need the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n    *   The orbital period ratios are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The ratio of the orbital period of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2.0 = 1.75.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final temperature ratio.**\n    *   Using the formula from step 2: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1.75)^(-1/3).\n    *   I will write a Python script to compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n# The problem states the orbital period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n# So, the period of Planet_4 is 3.5 units and the period of Planet_2 is 2 units.\nperiod_ratio_p4_to_p2 = 3.5 / 2.0\n\n# Step 2: State the relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital period (P).\n# From Kepler's Third Law, P^2 is proportional to r^3 (orbital radius cubed). So, r is proportional to P^(2/3).\n# Equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(r), or r^(-0.5).\n# Combining these, T_eq is proportional to (P^(2/3))^(-0.5), which simplifies to P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\nexponent = -1.0 / 3.0\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_p4_to_p2 ** exponent\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and compare with the given options.\nprint(\"The ratio of the orbital periods (P4/P2) is:\", period_ratio_p4_to_p2)\nprint(\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq4 / T_eq2) is:\", round(temperature_ratio, 3))\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.69\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.75\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.83\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.57\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value ~0.830 matches option C.\")\n\n# Final Answer Choice\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\")\n<<<C>>>\n```"
