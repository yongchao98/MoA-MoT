    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I need to identify two salts, A and B, and then count the total number of atoms in their chemical formulas. I am given information about the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Initial State:** An equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's say we have `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B. The total mass is 7.20 g.\n    *   **Heating:** The salts decompose into a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This substance absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The mass did not change, which means **no CO₂ was produced**. This is a key clue.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Hot Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is 0.80 g.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). This gas did not react with any of the previous substances.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles of Products:** I will use the provided data to find the number of moles of each gaseous product.\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Gas C:**\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   The gas is unreactive. Given that we are likely dealing with nitrogen-containing salts (a common theme in such problems), Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n        *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n4.  **Identify the Salts (A and B):**\n    *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must contain Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Since no CO₂ was formed, there is no Carbon (C).\n    *   The salts are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, as these are known to decompose into N₂, O₂, and H₂O. Let's consider the most common ones: ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   **Hypothesis:** Salt A is NH₄NO₃ and Salt B is NH₄NO₂.\n    *   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n        *   Ammonium nitrate (at ~200°C) can decompose as: `2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O`.\n        *   Ammonium nitrite decomposes as: `NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O`.\n    *   **Relate Moles of Reactants to Products:**\n        *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's say we have `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₂.\n        *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the stoichiometry `1 NH₄NO₃ → 1 N₂ + 0.5 O₂ + 2 H₂O`):\n            *   Moles of N₂ = `n`\n            *   Moles of O₂ = `0.5 * n`\n            *   Moles of H₂O = `2 * n`\n        *   From the decomposition of `n` moles of NH₄NO₂:\n            *   Moles of N₂ = `n`\n            *   Moles of H₂O = `2 * n`\n    *   **Total Moles of Products:**\n        *   Total Moles H₂O = (from NH₄NO₃) + (from NH₄NO₂) = `2n + 2n = 4n`\n        *   Total Moles O₂ = (from NH₄NO₃) + (from NH₄NO₂) = `0.5n + 0 = 0.5n`\n        *   Total Moles N₂ = (from NH₄NO₃) + (from NH₄NO₂) = `n + n = 2n`\n    *   **Solve for `n` using our calculated product moles:**\n        *   From H₂O: `4n = 0.2` mol → `n = 0.05` mol.\n        *   From O₂: `0.5n = 0.025` mol → `n = 0.05` mol.\n        *   From N₂: `2n = 0.1` mol → `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   The value `n = 0.05` is consistent across all three products. The hypothesis is correct. The salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n5.  **Verify with Mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (moles of A * Molar Mass of A) + (moles of B * Molar Mass of B)\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) = 4.0 g + 3.2 g = 7.2 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification is confirmed.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (meaning, in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will perform the calculations from steps 3, 5, and 6 to arrive at the final answer programmatically.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants from the problem.\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # Mass increase of tube №1 in grams\nmass_o2 = 0.80   # Mass increase of tube №3 in grams\nvolume_gas_c = 2.24  # Volume of remaining gas C in liters at STP\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nMOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.0\nMOLAR_MASS_O2 = 32.0\n\n# Molar volume of a gas at STP (L/mol)\nMOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the moles of each gaseous product.\n# The gas absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2 is H2O.\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n\n# The gas that reacts with hot copper is O2.\nmoles_o2 = mass_o2 / MOLAR_MASS_O2\n\n# The remaining unreactive gas C is N2.\nmoles_n2 = volume_gas_c / MOLAR_VOLUME_STP\n\n# Step 3: Deduce the identity of the salts and find the number of moles.\n# The products (H2O, O2, N2) suggest the decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2).\n# Let's assume the salts are A = NH4NO3 and B = NH4NO2.\n# The mixture is equimolar, so moles(A) = moles(B) = n.\n#\n# Decomposition reactions per mole:\n# A: NH4NO3 -> N2 + 0.5 O2 + 2 H2O\n# B: NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2 H2O\n#\n# Total moles of products from 'n' moles of each salt:\n# Total H2O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n\n# Total O2  = 0.5n (from A) + 0 (from B) = 0.5n\n# Total N2  = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n#\n# We can solve for 'n' using any of the product mole values. Let's use O2.\n# moles_o2 = 0.5 * n  => n = moles_o2 / 0.5\nn = moles_o2 / 0.5\n\n# We can verify this 'n' with the other products to be sure.\n# Verification with H2O: 4 * n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol (matches moles_h2o)\n# Verification with N2: 2 * n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol (matches moles_n2)\n# The value n=0.05 is consistent, so our salt identification is correct.\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O)\natoms_in_A = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O)\natoms_in_B = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result.\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is: {total_atoms}\")\nprint(\"The options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 17\")\nprint(\"B) 13\")\nprint(\"C) 19\")\nprint(\"D) 15\")\nprint(f\"The calculated value {total_atoms} corresponds to option A.\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<A>>>\")\n```"
