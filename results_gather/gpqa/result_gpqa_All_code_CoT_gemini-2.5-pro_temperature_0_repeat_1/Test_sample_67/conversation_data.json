    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the physical system:** We will use the matrix representation of quantum mechanics for a spin-1/2 particle. The state vectors and spin operators will be represented as 2x2 matrices and 2x1 vectors, respectively. We'll use symbolic mathematics to handle variables like `gamma`, `B`, and `t` (time).\n2.  **Identify the initial state:** The particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin up\" eigenstate of the `Sz` operator, which we denote as `|+z>`. In the standard Z-basis, this state is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n3.  **Define the new Hamiltonian:** When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The new Hamiltonian is given by `H = -μ · B = - (gamma * S) · (B * y_hat) = -gamma * B * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n4.  **Calculate the time evolution:** The state of the particle at any time `t > 0` is found by applying the time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/ħ)` to the initial state `|ψ(0)>`. So, `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`.\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value:** We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is proportional to `<Sz(t)>`. This is calculated as `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n6.  **Determine the oscillation frequency:** The resulting expression for `<Sz(t)>` will be an oscillatory function of time, typically involving a cosine or sine term like `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency `ω` is the quantity we need to find. By inspecting the argument of the trigonometric function, we can identify this frequency.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to derive the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_spin_precession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2\n    particle's magnetic moment under a sudden change in magnetic field direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define symbolic variables for the physical quantities.\n    # gamma: gyromagnetic ratio, B: magnetic field magnitude, hbar: reduced Planck constant, t: time\n    gamma, B, hbar, t = sp.symbols('gamma B hbar t', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # 2. Define the spin operators (Sz and Sy) as 2x2 matrices in the Z-basis.\n    # We use the Pauli matrices: sigma_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]], sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    Sz = (hbar/2) * sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n    Sy = (hbar/2) * sp.Matrix([[0, -sp.I], [sp.I, 0]])\n\n    # 3. Define the initial state of the particle.\n    # It's spin-up along the Z-axis, so |psi(0)> = |+z> = [[1], [0]].\n    psi_0 = sp.Matrix([[1], [0]])\n\n    # 4. Define the new Hamiltonian for t > 0.\n    # The magnetic field is B along the +Y direction, so H = -gamma * B * Sy.\n    H_new = -gamma * B * Sy\n\n    # 5. Calculate the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar).\n    # For a Hamiltonian H = c * sigma_y, the evolution operator is U(t) = cos(c*t/hbar)*I + i*sin(c*t/hbar)*sigma_y.\n    # Here, the argument of the exponential is (i * gamma * B * t / hbar) * Sy.\n    # Let alpha = gamma * B * t / 2. The operator becomes U(t) = exp(i * alpha * sigma_y).\n    # Using the identity exp(i*a*sigma) = cos(a)*I + i*sin(a)*sigma:\n    alpha = gamma * B * t / 2\n    identity_matrix = sp.eye(2)\n    sigma_y_matrix = Sy / (hbar/2)\n    U = sp.cos(alpha) * identity_matrix + sp.I * sp.sin(alpha) * sigma_y_matrix\n\n    # 6. Calculate the state vector at time t: |psi(t)> = U(t)|psi(0)>.\n    psi_t = U * psi_0\n\n    # 7. Calculate the expectation value of Sz at time t: <Sz(t)> = <psi(t)|Sz|psi(t)>.\n    # <psi(t)| is the conjugate transpose of |psi(t)>.\n    psi_t_dagger = psi_t.H\n    expectation_Sz_matrix = psi_t_dagger * Sz * psi_t\n\n    # The result is a 1x1 matrix, so we extract the single element.\n    expectation_Sz_value = sp.simplify(expectation_Sz_matrix[0])\n\n    # 8. Analyze the result to find the frequency.\n    # The expectation value is <Sz(t)> = (hbar/2) * cos(gamma*B*t).\n    # This is an oscillation of the form A*cos(omega*t).\n    # The angular frequency 'omega' is the coefficient of 't' in the cosine argument.\n    \n    print(\"The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is calculated to be:\")\n    print(f\"<Sz(t)> = {expectation_Sz_value}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment, <mu_z(t)>, is gamma * <Sz(t)>, so it oscillates with the same frequency.\")\n    print(\"The expression is of the form A*cos(omega*t), where the oscillation frequency omega is the coefficient of t.\")\n    print(\"From the expression, the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) gamma*B\")\n    print(\"B) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\")\n    print(\"C) gamma*B/2\")\n    print(\"D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe correct choice is A.\")\n\nsolve_spin_precession()\n<<<A>>>"
