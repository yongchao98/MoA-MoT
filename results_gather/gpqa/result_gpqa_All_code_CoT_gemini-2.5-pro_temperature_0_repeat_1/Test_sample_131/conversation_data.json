    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Spectrum:** First, we'll break down the information given about the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means the two compounds in the mixture must each contribute one aromatic singlet, and these singlets must represent the same number of protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This means the total number of alkyl singlets from both compounds must be three (assuming no accidental overlap, which is a reasonable starting assumption), and their combined proton integrations must simplify to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n2.  **Predict the Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound:** We will determine the expected 1H NMR signals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** Less symmetric.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Symmetric.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Highly symmetric, but contains ethyl groups which will show splitting (quartets and triplets), not singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:** We will test each of the four multiple-choice options by \"mixing\" the predicted spectra of the two compounds in that option and comparing the result to the target spectrum.\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Match:** The option whose combined spectrum perfectly matches the description (2 aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio, and 3 alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef simplify_ratio(integrations):\n    \"\"\"Simplifies a list of integration values to the smallest integer ratio.\"\"\"\n    if not integrations:\n        return []\n    common_divisor = integrations[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(integrations)):\n        common_divisor = math.gcd(common_divisor, integrations[i])\n    \n    return [i // common_divisor for i in integrations]\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data to identify two compounds in a mixture.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the predicted 1H NMR data for each compound based on its structure.\n    # 's' stands for singlet.
