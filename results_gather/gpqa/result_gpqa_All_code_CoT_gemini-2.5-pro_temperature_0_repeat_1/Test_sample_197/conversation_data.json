    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify all cobalt species:** The species in solution are the free Co(II) ion (`Co^2+`) and the various thiocyanato complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]2-`.\n2.  **Express the total cobalt concentration:** The total concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n3.  **Use stability constants (β) to relate complex concentrations to free ion concentrations:**\n    *   `[Co(SCN)+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n4.  **Substitute these into the total concentration equation:** This allows us to express `c(Co)` in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]`.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n5.  **Calculate the fraction (α₂) of the desired complex:** The fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4, the `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving an equation that only depends on the known `[SCN-]` and β values:\n    `α₂ = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n6.  **Calculate the final percentage:** We will plug in the given values (`[SCN-] = 0.1 M`, `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`) into the formula for α₂ and multiply the result by 100.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The total cobalt concentration is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution.\n\n# Let's calculate each term in the denominator of the alpha2 formula.\n# Let L = [SCN-]\nterm0 = 1  # for free Co^2+\nterm1 = beta1 * (scn_conc**1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\nterm3 = beta3 * (scn_conc**3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing the relative total concentration.\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2].\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex.\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage.\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\n# Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nOptions:\")\nprint(f\"A) 42.3%\")\nprint(f\"B) 38.1%\")\nprint(f\"C) 25.6%\")\nprint(f\"D) 16.9%\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
