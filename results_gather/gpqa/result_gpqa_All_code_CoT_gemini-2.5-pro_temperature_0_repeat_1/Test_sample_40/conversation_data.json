    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves the speed of light in a moving medium, which requires the application of Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula.\n2.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum. The problem specifies to use `c=1`.\n    *   `n`: The index of refraction of the glass.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory observer.\n    *   `u'`: The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass. This is given by `u' = c/n`.\n    *   `u`: The speed of light in the glass as measured by the laboratory observer. This is the quantity we need to find.\n3.  **Apply the formula:** The relativistic velocity addition formula for two velocities `u'` and `v` in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n4.  **Substitute and simplify:** I will substitute `u' = c/n` and `c=1` into the formula and simplify the resulting algebraic expression.\n5.  **Compare with options:** I will compare the simplified result with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will use Python's `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform the substitution and simplification, ensuring an error-free derivation. The code will print the derived expression and then identify the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_light_speed_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the speed of light in a moving medium\n    relative to a stationary observer using relativistic velocity addition.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variables\n    n, v, c = sympy.symbols('n v c')\n\n    # Step 2: Define the speed of light in the rest frame of the medium (glass)\n    # In the glass's own frame, the speed of light is u' = c/n\n    u_prime = c / n\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula\n    # The glass moves at velocity 'v' and the light inside it moves at 'u_prime'\n    # relative to the glass.
