    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, and determine which one is a better candidate for observation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a transit for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `Probability ∝ R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given. However, it can be related to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`) using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet's mass much smaller than the star's mass, the law simplifies to `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`. Rearranging for `a`, we get:\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substitute the expression for `a` into the probability formula:\n    `Probability ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** To compare the two planets, we will calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities (`Prob_1 / Prob_2`):\n    `Ratio = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)]`\n\n6.  **Apply the Given Information:**\n    *   The stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n    *   Star 1 is twice as massive as Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   Planet 1's period is one-third of Planet 2's: `P1 = P2 / 3`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute these relationships into the ratio formula and simplify to find the numerical factor. This will tell us which planet has a higher probability and by how much.\n\n8.  **Write Python Code:** Implement the calculation in Python to get a precise value for the ratio and match it to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem asks us to compare the transit probabilities of two planets.\n# The transit probability (Prob) for a circular orbit is proportional to R_s / a,\n# where R_s is the stellar radius and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n# From Kepler's Third Law, a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3), where M_s is the stellar mass\n# and P is the orbital period.\n# Therefore, Prob is proportional to R_s / (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).\n\n# Let's define the relationships between the properties of the two systems.\n# We can use arbitrary base values for system 2 and calculate the properties for system 1.\n# Let's set the properties for system 2 to 1 for simplicity.\nM_s2 = 1.0  # Mass of star 2\nR_s2 = 1.0  # Radius of star 2\nP2 = 3.0    # Orbital period of planet 2 (using 3 makes P1 a simple integer)\n\n# Now, define the properties for system 1 based on the problem description.\n# The host star of Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2.\nM_s1 = 2.0 * M_s2\n# Both host stars have the same radii.\nR_s1 = R_s2\n# The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2.\nP1 = P2 / 3.0\n\n# Now, we calculate a value proportional to the probability for each planet.\n# We can ignore any universal constants as they will cancel out in the ratio.\nprob_1_proportional = R_s1 / (M_s1 * P1**2)**(1/3)\nprob_2_proportional = R_s2 / (M_s2 * P2**2)**(1/3)\n\n# To find out how many times more likely Planet_1 is to transit than Planet_2,\n# we calculate the ratio of their probabilities.\nratio = prob_1_proportional / prob_2_proportional\n\n# The ratio indicates that Planet_1 has a higher probability.\n# Let's check which option this corresponds to.\n# Option A suggests a ratio of ~2.7\n# Option B suggests Planet_2 is preferred.\n# Option C suggests a ratio of ~1.65\n# Option D suggests Planet_2 is preferred.\n\n# We will print the final choice based on our calculated ratio.\n# We round the ratio to two decimal places for comparison with the options.\nrounded_ratio = round(ratio, 2)\n\n# The problem asks for the final choice.\n# We determine the choice based on the calculated ratio.\nfinal_choice = None\nif rounded_ratio == 2.70:\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelif rounded_ratio == 1.50: # This would be 1/1.5 for Planet 1 preference\n    final_choice = \"B\"\nelif rounded_ratio == 1.65:\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelif rounded_ratio == 2.25: # This would be 1/2.25 for Planet 1 preference\n    final_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to Planet_2 is approximately {rounded_ratio}.\")\nprint(\"This means Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\nprint(\"Final Answer Choice: C\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
