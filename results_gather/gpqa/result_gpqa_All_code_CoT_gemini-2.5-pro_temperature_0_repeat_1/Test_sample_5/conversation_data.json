    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates:** The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ). It's often easier to work with quantum harmonic oscillators in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). We will use the standard conversion formulas: `x = r*cos(θ)`, `y = r*sin(θ)`, and `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`.\n2.  **Identify the Separable Potential:** After converting, we will see that the potential `V(x, y)` can be separated into two independent parts, `V_x(x)` and `V_y(y)`. This means the system behaves like two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators (QHOs).\n3.  **Find the Angular Frequencies:** For each QHO, we will compare its potential to the standard form `V(q) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * q^2` to find its angular frequency `ω`.\n4.  **Determine the Energy Spectrum:** The energy of a 1D QHO is given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`. The total energy of the 2D system will be the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators, `E = E_x + E_y`.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will simplify the final expression for the total energy and match it with the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_energy_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step derivation of the energy spectrum for the given potential\n    and prints the final correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation for the energy spectrum:\")\n    print(\"==============================================\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Convert potential to Cartesian coordinates\n    print(\"Step 1: Convert the potential V(r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\")\n    print(\"The potential is given as: V(r, θ) = 1/2 * k*r^2 + 3/2 * k*r^2 * cos^2(θ)\")\n    print(\"Using the relations x = r*cos(θ) and r^2 = x^2 + y^2, we can substitute:\")\n    print(\"V(x, y) = 1/2 * k*(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k*(r*cos(θ))^2\")\n    print(\"V(x, y) = 1/2 * k*(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k*x^2\")\n    print(\"Combining terms:\")\n    print(\"V(x, y) = (1/2 * k*x^2 + 3/2 * k*x^2) + 1/2 * k*y^2\")\n    print(\"V(x, y) = 2*k*x^2 + 1/2 * k*y^2\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the potential as two independent QHOs\n    print(\"Step 2: Recognize the potential as a sum of two independent 1D Quantum Harmonic Oscillators (QHOs).\")\n    print(\"The potential is separable: V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\")\n    print(\"V_x(x) = 2*k*x^2\")\n    print(\"V_y(y) = 1/2 * k*y^2\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the angular frequencies and energies for each QHO\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the energy for each oscillator.\")\n    print(\"The standard 1D QHO potential is V(q) = 1/2 * m*ω^2*q^2, with energy levels E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor the x-direction oscillator:\")\n    print(\"1/2 * m*ω_x^2 * x^2 = 2*k*x^2  =>  m*ω_x^2 = 4k  =>  ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m)\")\n    print(\"The energy in the x-direction is E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor the y-direction oscillator:\")\n    print(\"1/2 * m*ω_y^2 * y^2 = 1/2 * k*y^2  =>  m*ω_y^2 = k  =>  ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\")\n    print(\"The energy in the y-direction is E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Sum the energies for the total energy spectrum\n    print(\"Step 4: Sum the individual energies to get the total energy spectrum E = E_nx + E_ny.\")\n    print(\"E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\")\n    print(\"Factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\")\n    print(\"E = [ 2*(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\")\n    print(\"E = [ 2*n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\")\n    print(\"E = (2*n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ*sqrt(k/m)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Compare with the given options\n    print(\"Step 5: Compare this result with the given options.\")\n    print(\"The derived energy spectrum E = (2*n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ*sqrt(k/m) matches option A.\")\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The correct choice is:\")\n    print(\"A\")\n\nsolve_energy_spectrum()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
