    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where structures can interconvert through the migration of a proton, most commonly seen in keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it generally needs a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen on an sp3-hybridized carbon).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has CH₂ groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are located between the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. The molecule can undergo tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus very stable compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds (sp2-hybridized) and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp3 carbon. Therefore, it does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*Conclusion for A:* The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common indicator of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon (C2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   -H (hydrogen)\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   -CH₃ (methyl)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and *will show* optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and has a plane of symmetry. It contains no chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and *will not show* optical isomerism.\n\n*Conclusion for B:* The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the properties of the given compounds to determine the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Analysis for Part A: Tautomerism ---\n    # Tautomerism (keto-enol) requires an alpha-hydrogen on an sp3 carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n    \n    # Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has sp3 carbons with alpha-hydrogens between the carbonyls.\n    # It readily tautomerizes to its stable aromatic enol form (phloroglucinol).\n    # Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione SHOWS tautomerism.\n    \n    # Benzoquinone's carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are sp2 hybridized (part of a C=C bond).\n    # It lacks the necessary sp3 alpha-hydrogens for typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n    # Conclusion: Benzoquinone DOES NOT show tautomerism.\n    \n    compound_A = \"benzoquinone\"\n    \n    # --- Analysis for Part B: Optical Isomerism ---\n    # Optical isomerism requires a chiral molecule, often identified by a chiral center\n    # (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    \n    # Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3):\n    # The central carbon is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.\n    # It is a chiral center.\n    # Conclusion: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate SHOWS optical isomerism.\n    \n    # Dimethyl fumarate (CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3):\n    # This molecule has a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers.
