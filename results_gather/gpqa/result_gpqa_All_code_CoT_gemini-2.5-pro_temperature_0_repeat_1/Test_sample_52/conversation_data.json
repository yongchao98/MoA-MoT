    "To solve this problem, we need to piece together the structural fragments of the molecule from the provided spectroscopic data and then sum up the atoms to find the chemical formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step deduction:\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The remaining part of the ring is C6H4. The 1H NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. This accounts for **C6H4**.\n2.  **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group (-COO-). This adds **C1O2** to our count.\n3.  **Substituents from 1H NMR:**\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (H on a C=C bond), one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern strongly indicates a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**. This fragment accounts for **C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these is the methyl group from the propenyl fragment we just identified. The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester.\n    *   **No -CH2- Groups:** The absence of any -CH2- signals is crucial. It means the second methyl group is not part of a larger alkyl chain like an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). In either case, this second methyl group adds **C1H3** to our count.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Formula:** Now, let's sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the second CH3) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the second CH3) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Matching the Option:** Comparing our calculated formula with the given choices:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step deduction of the molecular formula\n    based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the core structure\n    print(\"1.
