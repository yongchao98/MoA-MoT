    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core concept:** The question is about \"regularization at high energies.\" This is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinite values that arise in calculations, particularly those involving interactions at very short distances (which corresponds to high energies).\n2.  **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It is a cornerstone of the Standard Model but famously produces infinities in its calculations (e.g., loop diagrams). It absolutely requires regularization and a subsequent process called renormalization to make finite, physical predictions.\n    *   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum theory. However, it has its own high-energy problem: the self-energy of a point-like electron is infinite. While the term \"regularization\" is most associated with quantum field theory, this classical theory does have a divergence issue at short distances.\n    *   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory that requires regularization and renormalization to handle infinities.\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity. A primary motivation for string theory is that it is believed to be a \"UV-finite\" theory. By replacing point-like particles with one-dimensional strings, the theory \"smears out\" interactions at short distances. This is conjectured to resolve the infinities that plague quantum field theories, thereby eliminating the need for regularization.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, Superstring Theory is the only candidate listed that is proposed to be fundamentally free of high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences, and thus it would not require regularization.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that defines each option and its analysis. The script will then print the analysis and identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_theory_without_regularization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes different physical theories to determine which one does not require\n    regularization at high energies.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Quantum Electrodynamics',\n        'B': 'Classical Electrodynamics',\n        'C': 'Quantum Chromodynamics',\n        'D': 'Superstring Theory'\n    }\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': 'Requires regularization.
