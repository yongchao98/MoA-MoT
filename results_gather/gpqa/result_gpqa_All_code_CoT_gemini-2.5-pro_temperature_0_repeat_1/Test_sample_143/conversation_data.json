    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Lifetime and Decay Width:** The lifetime ($\\tau$) of a particle in its own rest frame is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$), related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Relativistic Effects:** Since the particle is moving at a high speed, we must account for time dilation. The lifetime in the lab frame is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance:** The distance a particle travels before decaying is its velocity multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame: $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau$.\n    *   **Convenient Formula:** This can be simplified using the relativistic momentum ($p$). The term $v \\cdot \\gamma$ can be expressed as $pc/E$ or $p/m$. A very useful formula for the mean decay distance is $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   First, calculate the momentum term, `pc`, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. This gives $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   Next, plug all the known values into the mean decay distance formula: $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{m_X} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Use the provided values: $E_X=8 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_X=1.2 \\text{ GeV}$, and $\\Gamma_X=320 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Use the standard value for the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$.\n    *   Ensure all units are consistent. It's easiest to convert everything to MeV and fm (femtometers).\n    *   Finally, convert the result from femtometers to meters ($1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$) to match the format of the options.\n\n4.  **Write the Python Code:** Implement the calculation strategy in Python, defining constants and variables, performing the calculation, and printing the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the physical constants and the given parameters. We will use the\n#    convenient constant hbar*c in units of MeV*fm.\n# 2. Convert all input energy and mass values to a consistent unit (MeV).\n# 3. Calculate the momentum term 'pc' using the relativistic energy-momentum\n#    relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.\n# 4. Use the formula for the mean decay distance in the lab frame:\n#    L = (pc / mc^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma). This formula correctly incorporates\n#    the particle's lifetime and relativistic time dilation.\n# 5. Calculate the distance L, which will be in femtometers (fm).\n# 6. Convert the final result from femtometers to meters and print it.\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\nhbar_c = 197.327  # Reduced Planck constant * speed of light, in MeV*fm\nE_X_GeV = 8.0      # Production energy in GeV\nm_X_GeV = 1.2      # Mass in GeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # Width in MeV\n\n# Step 2: Convert units to be consistent (all in MeV)\nE_X_MeV = E_X_GeV * 1000\nm_X_MeV = m_X_GeV * 1000\n\n# Step 3: Calculate pc (in MeV)\n# (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2\npc_squared_MeV2 = E_X_MeV**2 - m_X_MeV**2\npc_MeV = math.sqrt(pc_squared_MeV2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance L in femtometers (fm)\n# The ratio pc/m (or pc/mc^2) is dimensionless.\nL_fm = (pc_MeV / m_X_MeV) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X_MeV)\n\n# Step 5: Convert the result from fm to meters (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Step 6: Print the final result and the options\nprint(\"Calculation of the mean decay distance:\")\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay distance is {L_m:.4e} m.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(f\"B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(f\"C) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(f\"D) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
