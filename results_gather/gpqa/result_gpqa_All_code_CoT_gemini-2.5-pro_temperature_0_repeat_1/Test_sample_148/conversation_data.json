    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Observations:**\n\n*   **Observation 1 (1H NMR):** You see two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Implication:** This proton exists in two different chemical environments. This means you have two different species in your sample.\n    *   **Details:** The integrals are roughly equal, suggesting the two species are present in a ~1:1 ratio. The fact that you see two sharp peaks instead of one broad peak means that the interconversion between these two species is slow on the NMR timescale. The problem states that spin-spin coupling is not the cause.\n\n*   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):** You see two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n    *   **Implication:** The two species have different physical properties (like polarity), allowing them to be separated by chromatography.\n    *   **Details:** The peaks have equal intensities, confirming the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both peaks have the *same mass*, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This is a crucial piece of information: the two species are isomers of each other (same chemical formula, same mass), not a product and a precursor/impurity with a different formula. The use of elevated temperature can sometimes enhance the separation of isomers that interconvert (conformers or rotamers).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Possible Explanations:**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **Consistency with data:** Because they have different properties, they would give different NMR spectra (explaining the two alpha-proton peaks) and would be separable by standard LC (explaining the two LC peaks). They have the same molecular formula and mass, which is consistent with the MS data. A common example in peptides is the presence of *atropisomers* (or rotamers), which are diastereomers that arise from slow rotation around a bond (like an amide bond, especially near a proline residue). This phenomenon perfectly fits all the observations.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor is a starting material or intermediate used in the synthesis.\n    *   **Consistency with data:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the product, ruling this option out.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers.\n    *   **Consistency with data:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be distinguished by standard NMR or separated by standard (achiral) LC. You would see only one set of NMR peaks and one LC peak. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This is not a standard term, but it implies a side reaction. For example, forming a dimer.\n    *   **Consistency with data:** Such a side product would have a different molecular weight (e.g., a dimer would have roughly double the mass). This is contradicted by the MS data. The problem also explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is not the cause of the NMR peak duplication.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence (two NMR signals, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass for both species) is that the compound exists as a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. In the context of a peptide, this is very likely due to the presence of stable rotamers (atropisomers).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# The user wants to identify the most likely explanation for a set of analytical data.\n# Let's analyze the options based on the provided information.\n\n# Data Summary:\n# 1.
