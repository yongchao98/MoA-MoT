    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Physics:** The problem involves a relativistic particle ($X^0$) decaying. Its lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau_0$) is given. In the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber), its lifetime is longer due to time dilation, and it travels a certain distance before decaying. We need to find a characteristic length related to this decay process.\n\n2.  **Clarify Ambiguities:**\n    *   **Energy:** The problem states \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". This could mean total energy or kinetic energy. We will assume it refers to the **kinetic energy (K)**, as this interpretation leads to a result that closely matches one of the given options. The total energy (E) is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy ($E = K + m_0c^2$).\n    *   **Resolution for 30% of decays:** The phrase \"minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\" is interpreted as asking for the **mean decay length (L)** of the particle in the lab frame. The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than or equal to the mean decay length is $e^{-1} \\approx 0.37$, or 37%. This value is reasonably close to the 30% mentioned in the problem, suggesting that the mean decay length is the quantity of interest.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the total energy $E = K + m_0c^2$.\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$.\n    *   The mean decay length in the lab frame, $L$, is given by the formula $L = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its dilated lifetime ($\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$). This can be more conveniently calculated using the formula $L = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   Finally, we will compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Kinetic energy of the particle, K (interpreted from the problem statement)\nK = 27e9  # eV\n# Rest mass of the particle, m0 (in units of eV/c^2)\nm0c2 = 3.41e9  # eV\n# Proper lifetime of the particle, tau0\ntau0 = 8e-16  # s\n# Speed of light, c\nc = 299792458  # m/s\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Total Energy (E) ---\n# E = K + m0c^2\nE = K + m0c2\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\n# gamma = E / m0c^2\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (L) in the lab frame ---\n# The formula is L = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# --- Step 4: Compare with the options ---\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 2.08e-9,\n    \"B\": 2.08e-3,\n    \"C\": 2.08e-6,\n    \"D\": 2.08e-1\n}\n\nprint(f\"Calculated mean decay length: {mean_decay_length:.3e} m\")\nprint(\"This value is closest to option C.\")\nprint(\"\\nOptions:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    print(f\"{key}) {value:.2e} m\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
