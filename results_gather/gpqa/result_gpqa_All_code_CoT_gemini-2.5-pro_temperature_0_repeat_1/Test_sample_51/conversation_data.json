    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how the ratio of atomic populations in two energy levels changes with temperature. This is governed by the Boltzmann equation, assuming the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels, `ΔE` is the energy difference between them, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** The energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). The formula is:\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio of ratios:** We need to find the factor by which the population ratio changes. This is the ratio of the population ratio on the spotless star to that on the spotted star.\n    *   `Ratio_spotless = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotless))`\n    *   `Ratio_spotted = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n    The factor is `Factor = Ratio_spotless / Ratio_spotted`. When we divide these two equations, the statistical weight term `(g₂ / g₁)` cancels out.\n\n4.  **Derive the final formula:**\n    `Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotless)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n    Using the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_spotless - 1/T_spotted)]`\n\n5.  **Code the solution:** We will use Python to plug in the values for the constants and the given temperatures to calculate the final factor.\n    *   `T_spotless` = 6000 K\n    *   `T_spotted` = 5500 K\n    *   `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   `k` ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps to find the numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23    # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters from the problem\nT_spotless = 6000  # Temperature of the spotless star in K\nT_spotted = 5500   # Effective temperature of the spotted star in K\nwavelength_A = 1448 # Wavelength of the transition in Angstroms\n\n# Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the energy difference (delta_E) between the two levels\ndelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength_m\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the exponent for the final factor calculation\n# Factor = exp[(-delta_E / k) * (1/T_spotless - 1/T_spotted)]\nexponent = (-delta_E / k) * (1/T_spotless - 1/T_spotted)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final factor\nfactor = math.exp(exponent)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The factor by which the ratio changes is: ~{factor:.1f}\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) ~4.5\")\nprint(\"B) ~7.8\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.9\")\nprint(\"D) ~1.1\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
