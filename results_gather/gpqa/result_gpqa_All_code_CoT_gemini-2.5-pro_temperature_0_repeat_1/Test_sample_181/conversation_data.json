    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage relationship in a specific regime known as Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). To determine which statement is true, we need to analyze the fundamental assumptions made in the derivation of this equation.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation and assumptions:**\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (e.g., electrons injected from the cathode). The contribution from the other carrier type (holes) is considered negligible.\n2.  **Trap-Free Insulator:** The simplest form of the Mott-Gurney equation assumes the material is a perfect insulator with no electronic trap states within the bandgap. Any injected charge remains free to move. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, and the equation would need to be modified.\n3.  **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For SCLC to occur, the electrode must be able to supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device. This is called an Ohmic contact. It ensures that the current is limited by the bulk properties of the material (the \"space charge\"), not by the injection process at the contact. A Schottky contact, by contrast, typically forms an energy barrier that limits injection.\n4.  **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The model assumes that the dominant transport mechanism is carrier drift in the applied electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of carriers due to concentration gradients is assumed to be negligible. This is a valid approximation for sufficiently thick devices or high applied voltages. The drift current is the primary phenomenon being described, not something to be neglected.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. A Schottky contact is a rectifying contact that limits injection, whereas the Mott-Gurney law requires an Ohmic contact that provides an unlimited supply of carriers.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The basic Mott-Gurney law is derived for a single-carrier device.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This statement correctly lists all the key assumptions: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (which is an Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion. This is the correct answer.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney equation describes a drift-dominated current. Neglecting the drift current would mean there is no current, which contradicts the purpose of the equation. The assumption is that *diffusion* current is negligible, not drift current.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mott_gurney_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation and selects the correct statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.\",\n        \"B\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.\",\n        \"C\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.\",\n        \"D\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.\"\n    }\n\n    # The Mott-Gurney law is derived under the following key assumptions:\n    # 1.
