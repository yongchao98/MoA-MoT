    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Riddle:** The first step is to identify Substance X by carefully analyzing the clues provided.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting point of B is ~277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 3.85 °C. This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Standard water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.**\n        *   Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D), an isotope of Hydrogen (H). This means Substance X contains Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n        *   This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate, likely a metal hydroxide where hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (a metal deuteroxide). For example, heating aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, yields Al₂O₃ and H₂O. Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This suggests **G is a metal deuteroxide precipitate**.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Let's analyze possible gases from a reaction involving deuterium.\n            *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't match)\n            *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Doesn't match)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). (Matches!)\n        *   Therefore, **W is D₂ gas**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W (D₂) and forming precipitate G.**\n        *   We need a reaction that produces D₂ gas. A common way to do this is to react a deuteride-containing compound with a source of deuterium, like D₂O. If Y were H₂O, the gas produced would be HD, not D₂. So, **Y must be D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas).\n        *   This points towards X being a powerful reducing agent.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of X containing a heavier isotope and being a known reagent.\n        *   Let's test the reaction with a keto acid (which has a ketone group, -C=O, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). LiAlH₄ (and LiAlD₄) is strong enough to reduce both functional groups to alcohols (-CH-OH and -CH₂-OH). The resulting product, a diol, would contain exactly two oxygen atoms. This clue fits perfectly.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity of X:**\n    *   Based on all the clues, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's verify the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n        *   The reaction is violent.\n        *   Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate (G).\n        *   D₂ is the gas (W).\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n        *   All conditions are met.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The problem asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen, atomic number 1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (represented by its isotope, Deuterium).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all Aluminium atoms and all Deuterium atoms in one molecule of LiAlD₄.\n    *   We will use integer atomic masses for the calculation, which is standard for this type of problem.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminium (Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (D or ²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   In LiAlD₄, there is:\n        *   1 atom of Aluminium.\n        *   4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Al) = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (D) = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Code Plan:**\n    *   Create a Python script to perform the calculation: 27 + 8.\n    *   Print the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the elements and their counts from the formula of Substance X (LiAlD4).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al) and the lightest is Hydrogen (in its isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n\n# Step 2: Define the atomic masses of the relevant isotopes. We use integer masses for simplicity.\n# Atomic mass of Aluminium (Al) is approximately 27.\nmass_Al = 27\n# Atomic mass of Deuterium (D) is approximately 2.\nmass_D = 2\n\n# Step 3: Define the number of atoms of each element in the molecule LiAlD4.\n# There is 1 atom of Aluminium.\nnum_Al = 1\n# There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\nnum_D = 4\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total mass contributed by the heaviest element (Aluminium).\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_Al * mass_Al\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total mass contributed by the lightest element (Deuterium).\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_D * mass_D\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the cumulative (sum) of these two masses.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_heaviest + total_mass_lightest\n\n# Step 7: Print the final result.\nprint(f\"The cumulative atomic mass is: {cumulative_mass}\")\nprint(\"The correct option is D.\")\nprint(35)\n```\n<<<D>>>"
