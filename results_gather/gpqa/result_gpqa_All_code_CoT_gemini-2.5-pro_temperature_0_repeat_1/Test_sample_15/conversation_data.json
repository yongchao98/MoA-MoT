    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50/50) mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. This molecule has no chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The atoms around the C=C double bond lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides the answer. The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of these R/S descriptors indicates chiral centers. While some molecules with chiral centers can be achiral (meso compounds), this complex, substituted bicyclic system lacks the necessary internal symmetry. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule, and a sample of this specific isomer would be optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers (at C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The `(2R,3S)` configuration creates an internal plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers. This makes the molecule a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: an -OH group, a hydrogen atom, a `-CH2-CH2-` part of the ring, and a `-CH=CH-` part of the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule, which is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). Whether in a chair or boat conformation, this molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane can pass through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. A thorough check reveals no chiral centers in this molecule. Furthermore, there is a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group (`C=O`) and bisects the isopropyl group (`-CH(CH3)2`). This symmetry makes the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n\nSummary:\n- Optically Active: (2), (4), (5)\n- Optically Inactive: (1), (3), (6), (7)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n```python\ndef solve_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active.\n    A compound is optically active if it is chiral.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\": {\n            \"is_active\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"The molecule is planar and has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\"\n        },\n        \"(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\": {\n            \"is_active\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"The name specifies a single enantiomer (R,S configuration) of a complex, unsymmetrical molecule.
