    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle.** The problem involves binary stars with known periods and radial velocity amplitudes, and it asks for the ratio of their total masses. The key insight is that these are eclipsing binaries, which means their orbital inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees, so `sin(i)` is approximately 1. This simplifies the formula for the total mass of a spectroscopic binary system.\n\n2.  **State the formula.** The total mass `M_total` (the sum of the masses of the two stars, `m1 + m2`) of an eclipsing spectroscopic binary is given by the relationship:\n    `M_total ‚àù P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n    where `P` is the orbital period and `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars. The constants of proportionality cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio.** To find how many times more massive system 1 is than system 2, we need to calculate the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`. Using the formula from step 2, this becomes:\n    `Ratio = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`\n\n4.  **Assign variables.** I will assign the given values to variables in the Python code:\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `K1_1 = 10` km/s, `K1_2 = 5` km/s\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K2_1 = 15` km/s, `K2_2 = 10` km/s\n\n5.  **Calculate and print the result.** I will implement the ratio formula in Python, calculate the numerical value, and print it. Then, I will compare the result to the given options to select the correct one.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # Period in years\nK1_1 = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 in km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 in km/s\n\n# Define the parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # Period in years\nK2_1 = 15.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 in km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 in km/s\n\n# For an eclipsing spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M) is proportional to P * (K1 + K2)^3.\n# To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio:\n# M_ratio = M_system_1 / M_system_2\n\n# Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nK_total_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the numerator and denominator for the mass ratio\nnumerator = P1 * (K_total_1 ** 3)\ndenominator = P2 * (K_total_2 ** 3)\n\n# Calculate the final mass ratio\nmass_ratio = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the result and the available choices\nprint(f\"The total velocity amplitude for system_1 is: {K_total_1} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The total velocity amplitude for system_2 is: {K_total_2} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The mass ratio (M_system_1 / M_system_2) is calculated as ({P1} * {K_total_1}^3) / ({P2} * {K_total_2}^3)\")\nprint(f\"The calculated factor is: {mass_ratio:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the choices:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.6\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.4\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.2\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 0.7\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
