    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the starting material (Compound X) using the provided spectral data.**\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C bonds in an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n        *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the 7.2 ppm doublet is adjacent to the other, electron-donating, substituent.\n        *   Now, let's piece together the other substituent from the remaining signals: `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`, `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`, `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`.\n            *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n            *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: A multiplet for 2 protons is the -CH₂ group. It's adjacent to the -CH₃ (making it a quartet) and also coupled to the proton at 2.9 ppm (making it a multiplet).\n            *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n            *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A multiplet for 1 proton is the -CH group. It's attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic), the -CH₃ at 1.4 ppm, and the -CH₂ at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   Assembling the alkyl group: The structure is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option (C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the chemical reaction.**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). It also reduces ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols to alkanes.\n\n3.  **Determine the final product.**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 1 to a methyl group.\n    *   The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 is an alkyl group and will not be affected by the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Match the product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect isomer. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The code will print the steps of the deduction and then the final choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemical identification problem by analyzing spectral data and reaction conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the starting material, Compound X, from its spectral data.\n    # IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 (broad O-H of carboxylic acid), 1720 cm-1 (C=O of carboxylic acid),\n    # 1610/1450 cm-1 (aromatic C=C).
