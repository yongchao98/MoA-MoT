    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the genetic experiment to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2:** The single mutant `g2` results in a complete loss of resistance (0%). The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`) also show 0% resistance. When a mutation in one gene (like `g2`) masks the phenotype of a mutation in another gene (like `g1` or `g3`), this is called epistasis. The gene that does the masking (`g2`) is considered epistatic and is typically upstream in the genetic pathway. Since the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance (a 25% loss).\n    *   The `g3` mutant has 50% resistance (a 50% loss).\n    *   If the genes acted independently, we might expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n    *   However, the observed resistance for `g1g3` is only 10%. This is a much more severe phenotype than either single mutant alone and also more severe than a simple additive effect. This strong synergistic interaction suggests that G1 and G3 have related or overlapping functions, where the presence of at least one is crucial, and the loss of both is catastrophic for resistance. This relationship can be described as partial gene redundancy.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the epistasis claims between G1 and G3:**\n    *   For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) should be the same as the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance). This is false.\n    *   For G3 to be epistatic to G1, the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) should be the same as the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance). This is also false.\n    *   Therefore, there is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The first part is correct. The second part (\"gene redundancy\") is a plausible description of the synergistic interaction observed. The third part (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on the data.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** The first part is correct. The second part is a guess about the physical structure that isn't directly proven by the data. The third part is incorrect.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The first part is correct. The second part (\"pleiotropy,\" one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment, which only measures one trait (resistance). The third part is incorrect.\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** The first part is incorrect. G2, not G1, shows the classic signs of being the upstream transcription factor.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Option A provides the best description, even with an inaccurate third clause. The conclusions that \"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" (interpreted as a synergistic/partially redundant relationship) are strongly supported by the experimental data. The other options contain more significant errors or unsupported claims.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_interaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the results of a genetic experiment to determine the relationship\n    between three genes (G1, G2, G3) and selects the best conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Resistance levels for each mutant\n    resistance = {\n        \"control\": 100,\n        \"g1\": 75,\n        \"g2\": 0,\n        \"g3\": 50,\n        \"g1g2\": 0,\n        \"g1g3\": 10,\n        \"g2g3\": 0,\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the role of G2\n    # Check if g2 is epistatic to g1 and g3\n    g2_is_epistatic = (resistance[\"g2\"] == resistance[\"g1g2\"]) and \\\n                      (resistance[\"g2\"] == resistance[\"g2g3\"])\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Gene Interactions ---\")\n    if g2_is_epistatic:\n        print(\"1.
