    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze each case based on the principles of planetary physics.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Establish a Baseline:** We'll use Earth's average density (approximately 5.51 g/cm³) as our reference point.\n2.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n    *   **a)** A planet with Earth's mass and radius will, by definition, have Earth's density.\n    *   **b)** The density is explicitly given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n    *   **c) & d)** For planets with the same composition, their density changes with mass due to gravitational compression. A more massive planet will have stronger gravity, compressing its material more and resulting in a higher density. Conversely, a less massive planet will be less compressed and have a lower density.\n3.  **Calculate Densities:** We will write a Python script to calculate the approximate density for each scenario. For options (c) and (d), we'll use the established mass-density relationship for rocky planets, which shows that density increases with mass.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** The script will compare the calculated densities and identify the highest one, which will correspond to the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_exoplanet_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the densities of four hypothetical exoplanets\n    to determine which is the densest.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth's average density in g/cm^3\n    RHO_EARTH = 5.51\n\n    # --- Density Calculations ---\n\n    # a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\n    # Density is by definition Earth's density.\n    rho_a = RHO_EARTH\n\n    # b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\n    # The density is given.\n    rho_b = 5.5\n\n    # c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive.\n    # For rocky planets, density increases with mass due to gravitational compression.\n    # The relationship is approximately rho ~ M^x, where x is a positive value.\n    # A common model uses R ~ M^0.27, which leads to rho ~ M^(1 - 3*0.27) = M^0.19\n    mass_ratio_c = 5.0\n    exponent = 0.19\n    rho_c = RHO_EARTH * (mass_ratio_c ** exponent)\n\n    # d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\n    # Using the same relationship as above.\n    mass_ratio_d = 0.5\n    rho_d = RHO_EARTH * (mass_ratio_d ** exponent)\n\n    # --- Output Results ---\n\n    print(\"Estimated densities for each exoplanet:\")\n    print(f\"a) Density: {rho_a:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n    print(f\"b) Density: {rho_b:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n    print(f\"c) Density: {rho_c:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n    print(f\"d) Density: {rho_d:.2f} g/cm^3\")\n\n    densities = {\n        'a': rho_a,\n        'b': rho_b,\n        'c': rho_c,\n        'd': rho_d\n    }\n\n    # Find the option with the highest density\n    highest_density_option = max(densities, key=densities.get)\n\n    # Map the planet option ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') to the multiple-choice answer ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')\n    # A) d, B) c, C) b, D) a\n    answer_mapping = {'d': 'A', 'c': 'B', 'b': 'C', 'a': 'D'}\n    final_answer = answer_mapping[highest_density_option]\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe planet with the highest density is option '{highest_density_option}'.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to choice {final_answer}.\")\n    \n    # Final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_exoplanet_density()\n```"
