    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the knowns:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Identify the goal:**\n    *   Find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`).\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the distance:**\n    *   First, we calculate the time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   Then, we use this time to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame using the classical formula: `distance = v * Δt`.\n\n5.  **Execution:**\n    *   The Python code below will perform these calculations to find the final distance and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (km/s)\nv = 60000\n# Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time) in seconds\ndelta_t0 = 50\n# Speed of light (km/s)\nc = 300000\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# First, calculate the ratio (v/c)^2\nv_over_c_squared = (v / c)**2\n# Then, calculate gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c_squared)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and the options\nprint(f\"The calculated distance is: {distance:.0f} km.\")\nprint(\"Comparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 3 000 000 km\")\nprint(f\"B) 2 880 000 km\")\nprint(f\"C) 3 060 000 km\")\nprint(f\"D) 2 940 000 km\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
