    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**: The energy of a photon corresponding to a specific transition is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the formula `ΔE = hc/λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light. We are given `λ = 0.4861 μm`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`<H>`)**: This energy term arises from the interaction of the electron's orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field (Zeeman effect). The energy is given by `<H> = m * μ_B * B`, where `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number, `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton, and `B` is the magnetic field strength. We are given `B = 1 T` and that `m` has small values, so we can use `m=1` for an order-of-magnitude calculation.\n\n3.  **Compare the Magnitudes**: After calculating both `ΔE` and `<H>` in consistent units (Joules), we will compare their values to determine which of the given relationships (`=`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`) is correct.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Step 1: Define constants and given values ---\n\n# Physical constants from scipy.constants\nh = const.h  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = const.c  # Speed of light in m/s\nmu_B = const.value('Bohr magneton') # Bohr magneton in J/T\n\n# Given values\n# Wavelength lambda = 0.4861 um, converted to meters\nlambda_val = 0.4861e-6  # in meters\n# Magnetic field B = 1 T\nB_val = 1.0  # in Tesla\n# Small orbital magnetic quantum number m, we'll use m=1 for the calculation\nm_val = 1\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the transition energy Delta_E ---\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_val\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H> ---\n# <H> = m * mu_B * B\nH_para = m_val * mu_B * B_val\n\n# --- Step 4: Compare the two energies and print the results ---\nprint(f\"The transition energy (Delta E) for lambda = {lambda_val*1e6} um is: {delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"The paramagnetic coupling energy (<H>) for B = {B_val} T and m = {m_val} is: {H_para:.4e} J\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Compare the orders of magnitude\nratio = H_para / delta_E\nprint(f\"The ratio of <H> / Delta_E is: {ratio:.4e}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nConclusion:\")\nif ratio < 1e-3:\n    print(\"The paramagnetic coupling energy <H> is much less than the transition energy Delta E.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the correct relationship is: <H> << Delta E\")\n    final_choice = \"C\"\nelif ratio > 1e3:\n    print(\"The paramagnetic coupling energy <H> is much greater than the transition energy Delta E.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the correct relationship is: <H> >> Delta E\")\n    final_choice = \"D\"\nelif 0.9 < ratio < 1.1:\n    print(\"The paramagnetic coupling energy <H> is of the same order of magnitude as the transition energy Delta E.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the correct relationship is: <H> = Delta E\")\n    final_choice = \"A\"\nelse:\n    # This case covers > and < which are not \"much\" different\n    if H_para > delta_E:\n        final_choice = \"B\"\n    else: # H_para < delta_E but not <<\n        # Option C is the closest for any ratio < 1\n        final_choice = \"C\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe chosen option is: {final_choice}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
