    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:** First, we need to determine the number of moles of each reactive species present in the initial solutions.\n    *   Moles of the weak acid, acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Moles of the strong acid, hydrochloric acid (HCl). Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of HCl equal moles of H+ ions.\n    *   Moles of the strong base, barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions (OH-) per formula unit, the moles of OH- will be twice the moles of Ba(OH)2.\n\n2.  **Account for Neutralization Reactions:** The acids and bases will react with each other. The reaction priority is strong acid vs. strong base.\n    *   **Strong-Strong Reaction:** The H+ ions from HCl will react with the OH- ions from Ba(OH)2 in a 1:1 ratio to form water. We will calculate which one is in excess.\n    *   **Strong-Weak Reaction:** The remaining strong acid or strong base will then react with the weak species (CH3COOH). In this case, we will have excess strong base (OH-) reacting with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n3.  **Determine Final Composition:** After all reactions are complete, we will identify the major species remaining in the solution that determine its pH. The solution will contain a significant amount of excess strong base (OH-).\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Concentration and pH:**\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the mixed solution.\n    *   Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH- ions by dividing the remaining moles of OH- by the total volume.\n    *   Calculate the pOH using the formula: pOH = -log[OH-].\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH using the relationship: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Option:** Compare the calculated pH with the given choices to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_ph():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pH of a solution made by mixing CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Calculate initial moles of each species\n    \n    # Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid)\n    # Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L, Concentration = 0.1 M\n    moles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1\n    \n    # Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid)\n    # Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L, Concentration = 0.2 M\n    # HCl -> H+ + Cl-\n    moles_h_strong = 0.400 * 0.2\n    \n    # Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base)\n    # Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L, Concentration = 0.3 M\n    # Ba(OH)2 -> Ba^2+ + 2OH-\n    moles_oh_strong = (0.300 * 0.3) * 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Perform neutralization reactions\n    \n    # First, react the strong acid (H+) with the strong base (OH-)\n    # H+ + OH- -> H2O\n    if moles_h_strong >= moles_oh_strong:\n        # This case is not applicable here, but included for completeness\n        moles_h_after_strong_strong = moles_h_strong - moles_oh_strong\n        moles_oh_after_strong_strong = 0\n    else:\n        moles_oh_after_strong_strong = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\n        moles_h_after_strong_strong = 0\n        \n    # Next, react the remaining strong species with the weak acid\n    # In this case, remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH\n    # CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    if moles_oh_after_strong_strong >= moles_ch3cooh:\n        # Excess strong base remains\n        moles_oh_final = moles_oh_after_strong_strong - moles_ch3cooh\n    else:\n        # This case is not applicable here, but included for completeness\n        # A buffer solution would be formed\n        moles_oh_final = 0\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Calculate final concentration and pH\n    \n    # Calculate total volume\n    total_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300  # in Liters\n    \n    # The pH is determined by the excess strong base (OH-)\n    # Calculate the final concentration of OH-\n    conc_oh_final = moles_oh_final / total_volume\n    \n    # Calculate pOH\n    pOH = -math.log10(conc_oh_final)\n    \n    # Calculate pH\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the result and compare with options\n    print(f\"The calculated pH of the final solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\n    print(\"A) 12.62\")\n    print(\"B) 8.92\")\n    print(\"C) 8.68\")\n    print(\"D) 1.38\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option A.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_ph()\n<<<A>>>"
