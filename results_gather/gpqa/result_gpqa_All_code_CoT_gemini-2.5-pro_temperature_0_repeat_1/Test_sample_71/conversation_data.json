    "My plan to solve this problem involves a step-by-step analysis of the provided multi-step organic synthesis to determine the chemical structure of the final product, molecule **4**. Once the structure of **4** is established, I will analyze its molecular symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Formation of Product 1:** The first step involves reacting 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. The combination of a gem-dihalide precursor like 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI is a known method to generate a highly reactive diene in situ. In this context, it generates *o*-xylylene. This reactive diene then undergoes a double Diels-Alder cycloaddition with the two double bonds of the 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (the dienophile). The result is a large, polycyclic adduct, which is product **1**.\n\n2.  **Formation of Product 2:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This is a standard acidic condition used for the deprotection of a *tert*-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at the C7 bridge position is cleaved to form a secondary alcohol (-OH), yielding product **2**.\n\n3.  **Formation of Product 3:** Product **2** is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The alcohol group in **2** is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), forming product **3**.\n\n4.  **Formation of Product 4:** Product **3** is heated to 150°C. Product **3** is a derivative of 7-ketonorbornane. Such structures are known to undergo thermal cheletropic extrusion, where the C7 bridge is eliminated as a stable small molecule. In this case, the ketone bridge is eliminated as carbon monoxide (CO). The remaining molecular framework rearranges and aromatizes to form a stable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). This specific synthetic sequence is a known route to **Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene**. Therefore, product **4** is Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene.\n\n**Analysis of the Final Product (4):**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product, **4**, is Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (C₂₆H₁₆).\n*   **Symmetry:** To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we must examine the molecule's symmetry. Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, which means the molecule looks identical after a 180° rotation about this axis.\n*   **Counting Hydrogens:** The C₂ axis relates the 16 hydrogen atoms in pairs. No hydrogen atom lies on the axis itself. Therefore, the 16 hydrogens are grouped into 16 / 2 = 8 sets of chemically equivalent pairs. This means there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# This problem requires chemical reasoning to determine the final product's structure.\n# The code below summarizes the final step of the analysis.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the final product and its properties.\n# The reaction sequence produces Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene as product 4.\n# The chemical formula for Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene is C26H16.\ntotal_hydrogens = 16\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the final product.\n# Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene has a C2 axis of symmetry.\n# A C2 rotational symmetry means the molecule is unchanged by a 180-degree rotation.\n# This symmetry operation maps each hydrogen atom to an equivalent hydrogen atom.\nsymmetry_order = 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n# The number of distinct sets is the total number of atoms divided by the order of the symmetry group.\nnum_distinct_hydrogens = total_hydrogens / symmetry_order\n\n# The result is an integer.\nnum_distinct_hydrogens = int(num_distinct_hydrogens)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer.\n# The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\nprint(num_distinct_hydrogens)\n```\n<<<C>>>"
