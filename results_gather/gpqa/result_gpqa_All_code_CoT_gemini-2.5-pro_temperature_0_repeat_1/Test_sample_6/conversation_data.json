    "To solve this problem, we need to find the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$) when colliding with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon. This process is known as pair production.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to calculate this energy:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The core principle is the conservation of four-momentum in a relativistic collision. The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$.\n2.  **Set up the energy-momentum relation:** We consider the invariant mass squared, $s$, which is conserved before and after the collision.\n    *   Before the collision, for the two photons: $s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2$.\n    *   After the collision, for the electron-positron pair: $s = (p_{e^-} + p_{e^+})^2$.\n3.  **Calculate the threshold condition:** The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This happens when the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame. In this case, the total energy in the final state is just the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron and positron, which is $2m_e c^2$. The invariant mass squared for the final state is thus $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n4.  **Consider the collision geometry:** The threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray is minimized when the collision with the CMB photon is head-on. In this case, the invariant mass squared for the initial state simplifies to $s = 4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB}$, where $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n5.  **Equate and solve for the gamma-ray energy:** By equating the expressions for $s$ from the initial and final states, we get the threshold condition:\n    $4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n6.  **Plug in the values and calculate:** We will use the given value for the CMB photon energy ($E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$) and the known rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$). The final result will be converted to GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$) to match the given options.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the physical constants in electron-volts (eV)\n# Rest mass energy of an electron (m_e * c^2)\nm_e_c2_eV = 0.511 * 1e6  # 0.511 MeV in eV\n\n# Average energy of a CMB photon\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3  # 10^-3 eV\n\n# Calculate the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray in eV\n# Formula: E_gamma = (m_e_c2^2) / E_CMB\nE_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n# Convert the energy from eV to GeV (1 GeV = 1e9 eV)\neV_to_GeV = 1e9\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / eV_to_GeV\n\n# The options provided\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 9.5 * 1e4,\n    \"B\": 3.9 * 1e5,\n    \"C\": 1.8 * 1e5,\n    \"D\": 2.6 * 1e5\n}\n\n# Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The rest mass energy of an electron is {m_e_c2_eV:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The average energy of a CMB photon is {E_CMB_eV:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated threshold energy for the gamma-ray is {E_gamma_GeV:.3e} GeV.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {value:.1e} GeV\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\nclosest_choice = min(options, key=lambda choice: abs(options[choice] - E_gamma_GeV))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {E_gamma_GeV:.2e} GeV is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is {closest_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
