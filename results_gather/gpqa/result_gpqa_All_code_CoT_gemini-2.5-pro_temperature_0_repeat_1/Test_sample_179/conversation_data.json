    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy of the system of 13 charges. The configuration that results in the minimum energy must be determined.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Decomposition of Energy**: The total potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of two components:\n    *   The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_center_shell`).\n    *   The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_shell_shell`).\n\n2.  **Energy of Center-Shell Interaction (`U_center_shell`)**: Each of the 12 shell charges is at a fixed distance `r = 2 m` from the central charge. The potential energy for this part is constant regardless of the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere's surface. It is calculated as `12 * (k * q^2 / r)`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant and `q` is the charge of each particle.\n\n3.  **Energy of Shell-Shell Interaction (`U_shell_shell`)**: To minimize the total energy, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known physics problem (the Thomson problem), and for 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when they are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Icosahedron Geometry**: We need to calculate the potential energy for the 66 pairs of charges forming the icosahedron. The distances between vertices are not all the same. For an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r`:\n    *   There are 30 pairs of adjacent vertices, separated by the edge length `a`.\n    *   There are 30 pairs separated by a short diagonal of length `a * φ` (where `φ` is the golden ratio).\n    *   There are 6 pairs of antipodal vertices, separated by the sphere's diameter `2r`.\n\n5.  **Calculation**: We will calculate `U_center_shell` and `U_shell_shell` separately and then add them to get the total minimum energy. The Python code below will implement these calculations using precise values for the physical constants.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum energy of a system of 13 charges.\n    1 charge is at the center (P), and 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m around P.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define Constants ---\n    # Coulomb's constant in N m^2 C^-2\n    k = 8.9875517923e9\n    # Elementary charge in Coulombs\n    e = 1.602176634e-19\n    # Radius of the sphere in meters\n    r = 2.0\n    # Number of charges on the shell\n    N_shell = 12\n\n    # --- Calculate Basic Properties ---\n    # Charge of each particle\n    q = 2 * e\n    # A common factor in the energy calculation\n    k_q_squared = k * q**2\n\n    # --- Part 1: Calculate U_center_shell ---\n    # Energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 shell charges.\n    # This is constant as the distance 'r' is fixed.\n    U_center_shell = N_shell * k_q_squared / r\n\n    # --- Part 2: Calculate U_shell_shell for the minimum energy configuration ---\n    # The 12 charges on the sphere form an icosahedron to minimize their mutual energy.\n    # We need the distances between the vertices of this icosahedron.\n\n    # The golden ratio\n    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n\n    # The edge length 'a' of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 'r'\n    a = 4 * r / math.sqrt(10 + 2 * math.sqrt(5))\n\n    # There are three distinct distances between the 12 vertices:\n    d_edge = a  # Distance between 30 pairs of adjacent vertices (edges)\n    d_diag = a * phi  # Distance between 30 pairs of vertices (short diagonals)\n    d_anti = 2 * r  # Distance between 6 pairs of antipodal vertices\n\n    # Sum the potential energies for all 66 pairs on the shell\n    U_shell_shell = k_q_squared * (30 / d_edge + 30 / d_diag + 6 / d_anti)\n\n    # --- Part 3: Calculate Total Minimum Energy ---\n    U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell\n\n    # --- Print the Results ---\n    print(f\"The calculated minimum energy of the system is {U_total:.3e} Joules.\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) 122.330\")\n    print(\"B) 7.056 x 10^-27\")\n    print(\"C) 5.645 x 10^-26\")\n    print(\"D) 2.822 x 10^-26\")\n    \n    # Determine the correct option\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 122.330,\n        \"B\": 7.056e-27,\n        \"C\": 5.645e-26,\n        \"D\": 2.822e-26\n    }\n    \n    # Find the option that is closest to the calculated value\n    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda opt: abs(options[opt] - U_total))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value {U_total:.4e} J is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_energy_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
