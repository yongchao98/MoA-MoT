    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Reactants**: First, I will determine the number of moles of the reactive species, which are H+ ions from the acids (HCl and H2SO4) and OH- ions from the base (Ba(OH)2). I also need the moles of Ba2+ and SO4^2- for the precipitation reaction.\n2.  **Identify Limiting Reactants**: Two reactions occur simultaneously:\n    *   Neutralization: H+ + OH- → H2O\n    *   Precipitation: Ba^2+ + SO4^2- → BaSO4(s)\n    I will find the limiting reactant for each reaction to determine how many moles of product (H2O and BaSO4) are formed.\n3.  **Calculate Enthalpy Changes**:\n    *   I will calculate the heat released from the neutralization reaction using the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base, which is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol (or -13.7 kcal/mol).\n    *   I will calculate the heat released from the precipitation of BaSO4. The enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO4 is also an exothermic value, approximately -50 kJ/mol.\n4.  **Sum Enthalpies**: The total enthalpy change is the sum of the enthalpy changes from both the neutralization and precipitation reactions.\n5.  **Compare with Options**: Finally, I will compare the calculated total enthalpy change with the given options to find the correct answer. The options are in both kilocalories (kcal) and kilojoules (kJ), so I will perform the calculation in kJ and then convert it to kcal for a comprehensive comparison.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_enthalpy_of_mixing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total enthalpy change when solutions of HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 are mixed.\n    This includes both the enthalpy of neutralization and the enthalpy of precipitation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants and initial values ---\n\n    # Standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid/base (kJ/mol)\n    H_NEUT_KJ_PER_MOL = -57.1\n    # Standard enthalpy of precipitation for BaSO4 (kJ/mol).
