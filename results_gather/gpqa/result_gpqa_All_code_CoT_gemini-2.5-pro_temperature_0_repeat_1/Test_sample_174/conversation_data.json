    "This problem involves analyzing the radiation pattern and wavelength dependence of an oscillating charge distribution. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Model the Source:** An oscillating spheroid charge distribution with a symmetry axis can be modeled, to the lowest order, as an oscillating electric dipole. The axis of the dipole corresponds to the symmetry axis (the z-axis).\n2.  **Angular Dependence:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) from an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It follows the relationship `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle measured from the dipole axis (the z-axis).\n3.  **Maximum Power:** The maximum power per unit solid angle, `A`, is radiated where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (perpendicular to the axis). Therefore, we can write `dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`.\n4.  **Power at 30°:** We need to find the fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°`. This is calculated by evaluating `sin²(30°)`. Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n5.  **Wavelength Dependence:** According to the Larmor formula for dipole radiation, the total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency of oscillation (`P ∝ ω⁴`). The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this, we find that the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`. This is the basis for phenomena like Rayleigh scattering.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Combining these two results, the fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and the power's dependence on wavelength is `λ⁻⁴`. This matches option A.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the fraction and explains the reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_radiation_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the fraction of maximum power radiated at a specific angle\n    and determines the wavelength dependence for an oscillating charge distribution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Part 1: Calculate the fraction of maximum power at theta = 30 degrees.\n    # The radiated power per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an oscillating electric dipole\n    # is proportional to sin²(θ).\n    # dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ), where A is the maximum power (at θ=90°).\n    \n    theta_degrees = 30\n    # Convert degrees to radians for Python's math library\n    theta_radians = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n    \n    # Calculate sin(30°)\n    sin_theta = math.sin(theta_radians)\n    \n    # The fraction of maximum power is sin²(30°)\n    fraction = sin_theta**2\n    \n    # Part 2: Determine the wavelength dependence.\n    # The radiated power (P) from an oscillating dipole is proportional to the\n    # fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴).\n    # P ∝ ω⁴\n    # Since ω = 2πc/λ, it follows that ω ∝ 1/λ.\n    # Therefore, P ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n    # This means a possible form for the function f is λ⁻⁴.\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
