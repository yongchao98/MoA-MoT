    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γ * m * c^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   We will calculate the initial total energy of the electron-positron system.\n    *   After annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons of equal energy. We can find the energy of a single photon.\n\n2.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision.\n    *   The relativistic momentum of a particle is given by `p = γ * m * v`, or more conveniently by the energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, which gives `p = sqrt(γ^2 - 1) * m * c`.\n    *   We will calculate the total initial momentum of the system, which is purely along the horizontal axis.\n    *   We will then express the final momentum of the two-photon system in terms of the unknown angle `θ` that each photon makes with the horizontal axis.\n    *   Since the photons have equal energy and are emitted symmetrically (upper-right and lower-right), the vertical components of their momenta will cancel out, conserving the zero initial vertical momentum.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Angle:**\n    *   By equating the initial and final horizontal momentum, we can establish an equation involving `cos(θ)`.\n    *   We will solve this equation for `θ`.\n    *   The total angle between the two photons will be `2θ`.\n    *   Finally, we will convert the angle from radians to degrees and compare it with the given options.\n\nWe can simplify the calculations by working in a system of units where the rest mass of the electron `m_e = 1` and the speed of light `c = 1`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_annihilation_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the angle between two photons produced from an electron-positron annihilation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the given Lorentz factors.\n    gamma_e = 4  # Lorentz factor for the electron\n    gamma_p = 2  # Lorentz factor for the positron\n\n    # We will work in natural units where the electron rest mass (m_e) and the speed of light (c) are 1.\n    # In these units, Energy E = gamma and Momentum p = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n\n    # Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy.\n    # Initial total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n    E_initial_total = gamma_e + gamma_p\n\n    # This total energy is converted into two photons of equal energy.\n    E_photon = E_initial_total / 2\n\n    # Step 3: Apply Conservation of Momentum.\n    # The collision is along the horizontal (x) axis.\n    # The electron moves from left to right (+x direction).\n    p_electron_x = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1)\n\n    # The positron moves from right to left (-x direction).\n    p_positron_x = -math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\n\n    # The total initial momentum is the sum of the individual momenta.\n    p_initial_total_x = p_electron_x + p_positron_x\n\n    # After the collision, we have two photons.
