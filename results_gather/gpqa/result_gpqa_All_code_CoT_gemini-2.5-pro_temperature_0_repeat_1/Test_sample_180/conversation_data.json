    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to find the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) under a specific condition: the pp-III reaction branch in the Sun has just stopped producing neutrinos from our perspective on Earth. The 8.5-minute time delay mentioned confirms that we are observing the immediate effect of this shutdown.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Solar Neutrino Sources:** I need to identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy ranges.\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces low-energy 'pp' neutrinos (up to 420 keV). These are irrelevant for both bands.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** This branch is stated to be active. Its most important feature for this problem is the electron capture on Beryllium-7 (`7Be + e- -> 7Li + νe`), which produces a very intense, sharp (monoenergetic) line of neutrinos at **861 keV**.\n    *   **pp-III chain:** This branch is stated to be **stopped**. It is the source of Boron-8 (`8B`) neutrinos, which have a continuous and broad energy spectrum extending up to about 15,000 keV (15 MeV). Normally, `8B` neutrinos are the main source of flux above ~500 keV, except for the `7Be` line.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** These reactions are also active. They produce neutrinos, primarily from `13N` and `15O` decays, with continuous spectra that extend up to ~1200 keV and ~1730 keV, respectively. Their overall flux is significantly lower than the main pp-chain fluxes.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Flux in Each Band Under the New Condition:**\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n        *   The pp-III branch is off, so there is no contribution from `8B` neutrinos.\n        *   However, the pp-II branch is still active. The extremely strong `7Be` neutrino line at 861 keV falls squarely within this band.\n        *   Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is large and is completely dominated by `7Be` neutrinos.\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n        *   The pp-III branch is off, so the main contributor in this range, the `8B` neutrinos, is gone.\n        *   The `7Be` line is at a higher energy (861 keV), so it does not contribute here.\n        *   The only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy range is the CNO cycle (`13N` and `15O` neutrinos). The flux from the CNO cycle is known to be much smaller than the flux from the `7Be` line.\n        *   Therefore, the flux in Band 1 is very small.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Approximate Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n    *   Ratio ≈ (Small flux from CNO cycle) / (Large flux from `7Be` line)\n    *   The result will be a small number, much less than 1.\n\n5.  **Estimate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Let's use standard solar model values for a more quantitative estimate.\n    *   Flux of `7Be` neutrinos (at 861 keV) ≈ 5 x 10^9 neutrinos / (cm²·s). This entire flux is in Band 2.\n    *   Total flux of CNO neutrinos (`13N` + `15O`) ≈ 5 x 10^8 neutrinos / (cm²·s). This flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to ~1730 keV). The fraction falling in the 100 keV-wide Band 1 will be small. A rough estimate would be less than 10% of the total CNO flux, so < 5 x 10^7.\n    *   Ratio ≈ (5 x 10^7) / (5 x 10^9) = 10^-2 = 0.01.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.01. This matches option A. The Python code below will formalize this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the problem: The pp-III branch (source of Boron-8 neutrinos) has stopped.\n# 2. Identify the dominant neutrino sources for each energy band under this new condition.\n#    - Band 1 (700-800 keV): The primary source, Boron-8, is gone. The remaining source is the CNO cycle.\n#    - Band 2 (800-900 keV): The dominant source is the monoenergetic 861 keV line from Beryllium-7 (part of the unaffected pp-II branch).\n# 3.
