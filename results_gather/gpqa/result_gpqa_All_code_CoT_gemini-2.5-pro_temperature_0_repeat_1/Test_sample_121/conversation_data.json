    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Deduce the structure of Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br2) and a catalyst (here, pyridine and acetic anhydride) is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction brominates the alpha-carbon of the carboxylic acid. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) becomes 2-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deduce the structure of Product 2.** Product 1 (2-bromoacetic acid) is treated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester. Product 2 is ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deduce the structure of Product 3.** Product 2 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide in an SN2 reaction. Product 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Deduce the structure of the final Product 4.** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a variation of the malonic ester synthesis for forming rings.\n    *   First, NaH removes an acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom.\n    *   The excess NaH then removes the second acidic alpha-proton.\n    *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Determine the number of 1H NMR signals for Product 4.** We need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of hydrogen atoms in ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The carbon atom of the cyclohexane ring attached to the cyano (-CN) and ethyl carboxylate (-COOEt) groups is a chiral center because it is attached to four different groups. This means the entire molecule is chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three hydrogens of the -CH3 group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two hydrogens of the -OCH2- group are technically diastereotopic due to the chiral center. However, in the context of such problems, they are often treated as equivalent, giving **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   Due to the lack of symmetry, the five CH2 groups in the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are all chemically distinct from one another.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH2 groups, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (they cannot be interchanged by symmetry or rotation) and are therefore chemically distinct.\n        *   This means each of the 5 CH2 groups gives 2 signals.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 5 CH2 groups Ã— 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n    *   **Total Signals:** Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule: 1 (from ethyl CH3) + 1 (from ethyl CH2) + 10 (from the ring) = **12 signals**.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the structure of the final product, ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n# The molecule has a chiral center at C1 of the ring, making the molecule asymmetric.\n\n# Step 2: Count the signals from the ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3).\n# The three protons of the terminal methyl (CH3) group are equivalent.\nsignals_from_ethyl_CH3 = 1\n# The two protons of the methylene (CH2) group are treated as a single signal,\n# a common simplification for diastereotopic protons distant from a chiral center.\nsignals_from_ethyl_CH2 = 1\n\n# Step 3: Count the signals from the cyclohexane ring.\n# The ring has 5 CH2 groups. Due to the lack of symmetry, all 5 are chemically different.\nnum_distinct_ring_CH2_groups = 5\n# In each of these CH2 groups, the two protons are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent.\nsignals_per_ring_CH2 = 2\n# Total signals from the ring are the product of these two numbers.\nsignals_from_ring = num_distinct_ring_CH2_groups * signals_per_ring_CH2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of signals.\ntotal_signals = signals_from_ethyl_CH3 + signals_from_ethyl_CH2 + signals_from_ring\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final answer.\nprint(f\"Analysis of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate:\")\nprint(f\"Signals from ethyl -CH3 group: {signals_from_ethyl_CH3}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from ethyl -CH2- group: {signals_from_ethyl_CH2}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from cyclohexane ring: {signals_from_ring}\")\nprint(f\"Total distinct hydrogen signals: {total_signals}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis corresponds to choice B.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
