    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift. Light from distant objects is \"stretched\" to longer wavelengths as it travels through the expanding universe. The amount of this stretching is quantified by the redshift, 'z'.\n\n2.  **Define the key wavelengths:**\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (λ_rest):** This is the wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line as emitted by hydrogen, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Observed Wavelength (λ_observed):** This is the wavelength we detect on Earth. For a ground-based optical telescope to detect this line, the observed wavelength must be long enough to pass through Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs most light with wavelengths shorter than about 3500 Å (the \"atmospheric cutoff\"). Therefore, the minimum observed wavelength for a ground-based telescope is λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å.\n\n3.  **Use the redshift formula:** The relationship between rest wavelength, observed wavelength, and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n    `z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest`\n\n4.  **Calculate the lower limit:** To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to find the redshift `z` that shifts the Lyα line (1216 Å) just enough to be visible, i.e., to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (~3500 Å). We will plug these values into the formula and solve for `z`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the known physical constants.\n\n# The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# The approximate minimum wavelength (atmospheric cutoff) that can be detected\n# by a ground-based optical telescope, in Angstroms.\n# Light shorter than this is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere (mainly ozone).\nlambda_observed_min = 3500\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the lower limit on the redshift using the redshift formula.\n# z = (lambda_observed - lambda_rest) / lambda_rest\nz_min = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# Step 3: Print the result and the available choices to compare.\nprint(f\"The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is {lambda_rest} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum observable wavelength from the ground is approximately {lambda_observed_min} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift (z) is: {z_min:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 2.4\")\nprint(\"B) 1.9\")\nprint(\"C) 1.2\")\nprint(\"D) 3\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of approximately 1.88 is closest to option B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
