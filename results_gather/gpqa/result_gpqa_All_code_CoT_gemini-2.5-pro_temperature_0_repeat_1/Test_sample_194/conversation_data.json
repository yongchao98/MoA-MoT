    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Geometry:** The problem states that two planets share the same orbital plane. This means their orbital inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight is the same. The impact parameter (`b`) of a transiting planet is defined as the projected distance between the planet's center and the star's center at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius. The formula is `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `R_star` is the stellar radius.\n\n2.  **Set the Transit Condition:** A planet will transit its star if its center passes over the star's disk. The maximum possible impact parameter for this to occur is `b = 1` (a grazing transit). To find the maximum orbital period for the second planet, we must find its maximum possible semi-major axis, which corresponds to this limiting case of `b_max = 1`. The condition for an occultation is automatically met if a transit occurs for a circular orbit.\n\n3.  **Relate the Two Planets:** We can write the impact parameter equations for both planets:\n    *   Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_star`\n    *   Planet 2 (at max period): `b2_max = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_star`\n\n    By dividing the second equation by the first, we can eliminate the unknown terms (`cos(i)` and `R_star`) and find the ratio of the semi-major axes: `a2_max / a1 = b2_max / b1`.\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (`T`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`). This gives the relationship: `(T2 / T1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** By substituting the known values (`T1 = 3` days, `b1 = 0.2`, and `b2_max = 1`), we can solve for the maximum period of the second planet (`T2_max`). The radii of the planets and the star are not needed for this calculation, as they are implicitly handled by the definition of the impact parameter.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given information ---\n# Period of the first planet (days)\nT1 = 3.0\n# Impact parameter of the first planet\nb1 = 0.2\n\n# --- Logic ---\n# 1. The condition for a second planet to transit is that its impact parameter, b2, must be less than or equal to 1.\n# To find the maximum orbital period, we need the maximum semi-major axis, which corresponds to the maximum\n# possible impact parameter for a transit. We set b2_max = 1.\nb2_max = 1.0\n\n# 2. The impact parameter 'b' is related to the semi-major axis 'a' by b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star.\n# Since both planets share the same orbital plane (same inclination 'i') and orbit the same star (same R_star),\n# the ratio of their semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of their impact parameters.\n# a2_max / a1 = b2_max / b1\na_ratio = b2_max / b1\n\n# 3. According to Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star, (T2/T1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.\n# We can find the ratio of the periods.\n# (T2_max / T1)^2 = (a2_max / a1)^3\nT_ratio_squared = a_ratio**3\n\n# Solve for the ratio of the periods\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(T_ratio_squared)\n\n# 4. Calculate the maximum period for the second planet.\nT2_max = T1 * T_ratio\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(f\"The ratio of the semi-major axes (a2_max / a1) is: {a_ratio}\")\nprint(f\"The maximum orbital period of the second planet is: {T2_max:.1f} days.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the choices:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 33.5\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 37.5\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 12.5\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 7.5\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches choice A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
