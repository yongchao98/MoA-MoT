    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus:** The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it contains 3 protons. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li), with 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n2.  **Determine the Rest Energy ($E_0$):** The rest energy of the nucleus ($E_0 = m_0c^2$) can be approximated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. We will use the standard values for the rest mass energy of a proton and a neutron.\n    *   Proton rest energy ($m_p c^2$) ≈ 938.272 MeV\n    *   Neutron rest energy ($m_n c^2$) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n    *   $E_0 = (3 \\times m_p c^2) + (3 \\times m_n c^2)$\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by $E = \\gamma E_0$. The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, depends on the velocity ($v$) and is calculated using the formula:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   Given that the speed $v = 0.96c$, the ratio $v/c$ is 0.96.\n4.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):** Multiply the Lorentz factor by the rest energy to find the total energy.\n    *   $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n5.  **Compare and Select:** Compare the calculated energy with the given options to find the correct answer. The result will be calculated in MeV and then converted to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV) for comparison.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the physical constants and given values.\n# The speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light (c).\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Rest mass energies for a proton and a neutron in Mega-electron Volts (MeV).\nproton_rest_energy_mev = 938.272\nneutron_rest_energy_mev = 939.565\n\n# The nucleus is Lithium with 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the rest energy (E0) of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n# We approximate this by summing the rest energies of its components.\nnucleus_rest_energy_mev = (num_protons * proton_rest_energy_mev) + (num_neutrons * neutron_rest_energy_mev)\n\n# Convert the rest energy from MeV to Giga-electron Volts (GeV).\nnucleus_rest_energy_gev = nucleus_rest_energy_mev / 1000.0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma).\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).\ntotal_energy_gev = gamma * nucleus_rest_energy_gev\n\n# Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 21.419,\n    \"B\": 20.132,\n    \"C\": 23.069,\n    \"D\": 18.475\n}\n\n# Find the option closest to our calculated value.\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - total_energy_gev))\n\n# Print the calculated energy and the chosen option.\n# The precision is set to 1e-4, which means 4 decimal places.\nprint(f\"Calculation Steps:\")\nprint(f\"1. Rest Energy (E0) of Li-6 nucleus = {nucleus_rest_energy_gev:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"2. Lorentz Factor (gamma) for v=0.96c = {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"3.
