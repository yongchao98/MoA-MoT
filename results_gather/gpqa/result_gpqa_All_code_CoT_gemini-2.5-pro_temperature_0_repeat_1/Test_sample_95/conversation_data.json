    "To solve this problem, we will calculate the entropy of the black hole using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Given Values:** We'll start by defining the necessary physical constants (speed of light `c`, gravitational constant `G`, Boltzmann constant `k_B`, reduced Planck constant `ħ`) and the given values (distance `d`, angular size `θ`).\n2.  **Unit Conversion:** The given distance is in parsecs and the angular size is in degrees. We need to convert these to SI units (meters and radians, respectively) for our calculations.\n3.  **Calculate the Black Hole's Radius:** We can relate the angular size (`θ`), distance (`d`), and the physical diameter of the event horizon (`2 * R_s`, where `R_s` is the Schwarzschild radius) using the small-angle approximation: `θ_rad ≈ (2 * R_s) / d`. We will rearrange this to solve for `R_s`.\n4.  **Calculate the Event Horizon Area:** The area (`A`) of the event horizon is that of a sphere with radius `R_s`, so `A = 4 * π * R_s^2`.\n5.  **Calculate the Entropy:** We will use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula: `S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * ħ)`.\n6.  **Determine the Order of Magnitude:** Finally, we will examine the calculated value of the entropy `S` to determine its order of magnitude and select the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values in SI units\n# Given values\nd_parsecs = 10**10  # distance in parsecs\ntheta_degrees = 10**-17  # angular size in degrees\n\n# Physical constants\nc = 3.0e8  # Speed of light in m/s\nG = 6.674e-11  # Gravitational constant in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\nk_B = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\nhbar = 1.054e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\n\n# Conversion factors\nparsec_to_meter = 3.086e16  # meters per parsec\n\n# Step 2: Convert units\n# Convert distance from parsecs to meters\nd = d_parsecs * parsec_to_meter\n# Convert angular size from degrees to radians\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_degrees)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R_s)\n# Using the small-angle approximation: theta_rad = (2 * R_s) / d\n# Rearranging for R_s: R_s = (theta_rad * d) / 2\nR_s = (theta_rad * d) / 2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the event horizon (A)\n# A = 4 * pi * R_s^2\nA = 4 * math.pi * R_s**2\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S)\n# S = (k_B * c^3 * A) / (4 * G * hbar)\nS = (k_B * c**3 * A) / (4 * G * hbar)\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and determine the order of magnitude\nprint(f\"The distance to the galaxy is {d:.2e} meters.\")\nprint(f\"The angular size is {theta_rad:.2e} radians.\")\nprint(f\"The Schwarzschild radius of the black hole is {R_s:.2e} meters.\")\nprint(f\"The area of the event horizon is {A:.2e} m^2.\")\nprint(f\"The entropy of the black hole is {S:.2e} J/K.\")\n\n# Compare with the options\n# A) 10^65 J/K\n# B) 10^62 J/K\n# C) 10^66 J/K\n# D) 10^59 J/K\n# The calculated entropy is on the order of 10^62 J/K.\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated entropy is on the order of 10^62 J/K, which corresponds to option B.\")\nprint(\"A) 10^65 J/K\")\nprint(\"B) 10^62 J/K\")\nprint(\"C) 10^66 J/K\")\nprint(\"D) 10^59 J/K\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
