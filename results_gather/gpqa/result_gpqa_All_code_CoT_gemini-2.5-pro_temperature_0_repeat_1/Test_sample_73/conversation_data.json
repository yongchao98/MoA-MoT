    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** Radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay is irrelevant to the future probability. We only need to calculate the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n2.  **Use the exponential decay law:** The probability of an atom *surviving* (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by `P_survival(t) = exp(-λ*t)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of it decaying is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t)`.\n3.  **Find the survival probability from the given data:** We are given that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means `P_survival(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   So, we have `exp(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n4.  **Calculate the required probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which is `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`.\n5.  **Relate the two probabilities:** We can express `exp(-λ * 150)` in terms of `exp(-λ * 100)`:\n    *   `exp(-λ * 150) = exp(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value: `P_survival(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The final probability of decay in 150 minutes is `1 - (0.68)^1.5`. The Python code will perform this calculation and format the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given information.\n# Probability of decay within 100 minutes.\np_decay_100_min = 0.32\nt1 = 100\n\n# The time interval we are interested in is 150 minutes.\n# The 50 minutes that have passed are irrelevant due to the memoryless nature of radioactive decay.\nt2 = 150\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the probability of survival in the first interval.\n# P(survival) = 1 - P(decay)\np_survival_100_min = 1 - p_decay_100_min\n\n# From the decay law, P(survival) = exp(-lambda * t).\n# So, p_survival_100_min = exp(-lambda * 100).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the probability of survival for the new interval (150 minutes).\n# We want to find P(survival) for t2 = 150 minutes.\n# P_survival(150) = exp(-lambda * 150)\n# We can rewrite this as: exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5\n# So, P_survival(150) = (p_survival_100_min)^(150/100)\np_survival_150_min = p_survival_100_min ** (t2 / t1)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the probability of decay for the 150-minute interval.\np_decay_150_min = 1 - p_survival_150_min\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the options.\nprint(f\"The probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is: {p_decay_150_min:.2%}\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 44%\")\nprint(\"B) 48%\")\nprint(\"C) 40%\")\nprint(\"D) 52%\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
