    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The periodic shift in a spectral line (Δλ) due to the Doppler effect is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity, which is known as the RV amplitude (K). Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes (K₂/K₁) is equal to the ratio of the observed wavelength shifts (Δλ₂/Δλ₁).\n\n2.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):** We need to establish a relationship between the RV amplitude (K) and the planet's orbital period (T).\n    *   The RV amplitude K is proportional to the planet's orbital velocity, `v_p` (since the star and planet masses are given as the same for both systems). So, `K ∝ v_p`.\n    *   For a circular orbit, the planet's orbital velocity `v_p` is determined by the balance between gravity and centripetal force, which results in `v_p` being inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius `a`. So, `v_p ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²`.\n    *   According to Kepler's Third Law, for a given stellar mass (which is the same for both stars), the square of the orbital period `T` is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius `a`. So, `T² ∝ a³`, which can be rearranged to `a ∝ T²ᐟ³`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Proportionalities:** By substituting these relationships, we can find how K depends on T.\n    *   `K ∝ v_p ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ² ∝ (T²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ² ∝ T⁻¹ᐟ³`.\n    *   This gives us the key relationship: `K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)⁻¹ᐟ³`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Period Ratio:** We can now rearrange the formula and use the given values to solve for the ratio of the orbital periods, T₂/T₁.\n    *   Rearranging the formula gives: `T₂ / T₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³`.\n    *   We are given Δλ₁ = 5 and Δλ₂ = 7, so `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n    *   Therefore, the final calculation is: `T₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the periodic wavelength shifts in miliangstroms.\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7\n\n# The ratio of the RV amplitudes (K) is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n# We need the ratio K1 / K2 for our final formula.\nratio_K1_over_K2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# As derived in the plan, the relationship between the period ratio (T2/T1)\n# and the RV amplitude ratio (K1/K2) is: T2 / T1 = (K1 / K2)^3.\nperiod_ratio_T2_over_T1 = ratio_K1_over_K2 ** 3\n\n# Print the final calculated ratio\nprint(f\"The ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (T2/T1) is: {period_ratio_T2_over_T1:.2f}\")\n\n# Print the given choices for comparison\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 0.85\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 1.96\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 0.36\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 1.40\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
