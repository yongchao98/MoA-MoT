    "My plan to solve this problem is to compare the physical definitions of the two mean free paths, λ1 and λ2, by analyzing their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path, λ, is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is given by the formula λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section. In this scenario, the gas number density 'n' is constant. Thus, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):** λ1 is the MFP for a gas molecule moving among other gas molecules. Here, both the projectile and the target have a significant size (let's say diameter 'd') and are in constant thermal motion. The effective collision cross-section (σ1) for this interaction, which accounts for the relative motion, is σ1 = √2 * π * d².\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):** λ2 is the MFP for a high-energy electron moving through the same gas. Compared to the gas molecule, the electron is essentially a point particle (its size is negligible). Also, due to the high accelerating voltage (1000 kV), the electron's velocity is extremely high, making the gas molecules appear as stationary targets. The collision cross-section (σ2) is therefore simply the geometric area presented by the gas molecule: σ2 = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (π * d²) / 4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** We can now find the ratio of λ2 to λ1.\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = (1 / (n * σ2)) / (1 / (n * σ1)) = σ1 / σ2\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * π * d²) / ((π * d²) / 4)\n    *   λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The code below will calculate the numerical value of this ratio and compare it to the given options to determine the correct conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the ratio of the collision cross-sections.\n# As derived in the explanation, the ratio of the mean free paths is the inverse of the ratio of their collision cross-sections.\n# λ2 / λ1 = σ1 / σ2\n# σ1 (gas-gas) = sqrt(2) * π * d^2\n# σ2 (electron-gas) = (π * d^2) / 4\n# The ratio λ2 / λ1 is therefore (sqrt(2) * π * d^2) / ((π * d^2) / 4)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the numerical value of the ratio.\n# The terms π and d^2 cancel out.\nratio = 4 * math.sqrt(2)\n\n# Step 3: Compare the result with the given options.\n# A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  (i.e., 1 < ratio < 1.22)\n# B) λ2 < λ1             (i.e., ratio < 1)\n# C) λ2 = λ1             (i.e., ratio = 1)\n# D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1        (i.e., ratio >= 1.22)\n\nprint(f\"The theoretical ratio of λ2 to λ1 is 4 * sqrt(2), which is approximately {ratio:.4f}.\")\nprint(\"This means that the mean free path for an electron (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path for a gas molecule (λ1).\")\n\n# Step 4: Determine which option is correct based on the calculated ratio.\nif ratio >= 1.22:\n    correct_option = \"D\"\nelif ratio > 1:\n    correct_option = \"A\"\nelif ratio < 1:\n    correct_option = \"B\"\nelse:\n    correct_option = \"C\"\n\nprint(f\"Since {ratio:.4f} is greater than or equal to 1.22, the correct option is D.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
