    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model:** The problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy (E) of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational energy (E_vib) and rotational energy (E_rot).\n    *   Vibrational energy: `E_vib = ħ * w * (v + 1/2)`, where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `w` is the angular frequency.\n    *   Rotational energy: `E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * J * (J + 1)`, where `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Transition:**\n    *   The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which has the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". In the context of photon absorption from the ground state, we must consider the selection rules: Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from `J = 0`, the only possible change is ΔJ = +1, so the final rotational state must be `J = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   Initial Energy (v=0, J=0): `E_initial = ħ * w * (0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0 * (0 + 1) = (1/2)ħw`\n    *   Final Energy (v=1, J=1): `E_final = ħ * w * (1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1 * (1 + 1) = (3/2)ħw + ħ²/I`\n    *   Energy Difference: `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħw + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħw] = ħw + ħ²/I`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Photon Momentum (p):** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = p * c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `p = ΔE / c = (ħw + ħ²/I) / c`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will use Python to compute the numerical value. This involves:\n    *   Defining physical constants (`ħ`, `c`, `amu_to_kg`).\n    *   Calculating the reduced mass (`μ`) of the molecule: `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n    *   Calculating the moment of inertia (`I`): `I = μ * R²`.\n    *   Substituting all values into the momentum formula to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given parameters in SI units\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792458e8        # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27 # AMU to kg conversion factor\n\n# Given parameters\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2.0 # Bond length in angstroms\nw = 4.0e14     # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Convert parameters to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10 # Convert angstroms to meters\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the energy difference (delta_E) for the transition\n# The transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1)\n# delta_E = E_final - E_initial = (h_bar*w + h_bar**2 / I)\ndelta_E = (h_bar * w) + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the photon's momentum (p)\n# p = delta_E / c\np = delta_E / c\n\n# Step 6: Print the results and the final choice\nprint(f\"Reduced mass (mu): {mu:.4e} kg\")\nprint(f\"Moment of inertia (I): {I:.4e} kg*m^2\")\nprint(f\"Energy of transition (delta_E): {delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Calculated photon momentum (p): {p:.4e} N*s\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1.1e-27,\n    \"B\": 1.9e-28,\n    \"C\": 2.3e-27,\n    \"D\": 1.4e-28\n}\n\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) p = {value:.1e} N*s\")\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_choice = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - p))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated momentum {p:.2e} N*s is closest to option {closest_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {closest_choice}\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
