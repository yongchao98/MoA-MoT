    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex, which we can write as $[CaY]^{2-}$, dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex, which is for the reverse reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n    *   **Initial:** $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02$ M; $[Ca^{2+}] = 0$; $[Y^{4-}] = 0$\n    *   **Change:** $[[CaY]^{2-}] = -x$; $[Ca^{2+}] = +x$; $[Y^{4-}] = +x$\n    *   **Equilibrium:** $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$; $[Ca^{2+}] = x$; $[Y^{4-}] = x$\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply an Approximation:** Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation will be minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore approximate $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Calculate 'x':** The simplified equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Now, solve for 'x' by taking the square root:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x'. Therefore, $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # Molar concentration of Ca-EDTA\nKf = 5e10  # Formation constant\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kf = ([Ca-EDTA]) / ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA])\n# Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ at equilibrium.\n# Then [EDTA] = x and [Ca-EDTA] = initial_complex_conc - x\n# Kf = (initial_complex_conc - x) / (x * x)\n# Since Kf is very large, x is very small, so we can approximate:\n# initial_complex_conc - x ≈ initial_complex_conc\n# The equation simplifies to: Kf ≈ initial_complex_conc / x^2\n# We can solve for x: x = sqrt(initial_complex_conc / Kf)\n\n# Perform the calculation\nca_ion_conc = math.sqrt(initial_complex_conc / Kf)\n\nprint(f\"The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is {initial_complex_conc} M.\")\nprint(f\"The formation constant (Kf) is {Kf:.1e}.\")\nprint(\"The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], is calculated as the square root of ([Ca-EDTA] / Kf).\")\nprint(f\"Calculated [Ca^2+] = {ca_ion_conc:.2e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option B.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
