    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics and the Boltzmann Equation**\nThe problem describes the relative excitation of atoms in two stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the number of atoms in two different energy levels (`N_j`, `N_i`) to the temperature (`T`) and the energy difference between the levels (`ΔE = E_j - E_i`).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is: `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\nHere, `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels, and `k` is the Boltzmann constant. The ratio `N_j / N_i` represents the \"excitation\" mentioned in the problem.\n\n**2. Set Up Equations for Both Stars**\nLet's denote the excitation ratio for star 1 (temperature `T_1`) as `R_1` and for star 2 (temperature `T_2`) as `R_2`. The term `(g_j / g_i)` is a constant for the specific energy levels being considered.\n\nFor star 1: `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\nFor star 2: `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**3. Use the Relationship Given in the Problem**\nWe are told that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2:\n`R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nThe constant term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels out:\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**4. Solve for the Temperatures**\nTo simplify, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n`ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n\nUsing logarithm rules (`ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`):\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n`ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n`(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\nCombine the fractions in the parentheses:\n`(ΔE / k) * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)) = ln(2)`\n\n**5. Use the Provided Numerical Values**\nThe problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\nThe Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\nThe ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our equation:\n`1 * ((T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)) = ln(2)`\n`ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks to identify the correct equation relating the temperatures\n# of two stars based on the relative excitation of their iron atoms.\n\n# 1. The physical principle governing the population of atomic energy levels in\n#    Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is the Boltzmann equation:\n#    Ratio = C * exp(-dE / (k * T))\n#    where C is a constant, dE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann\n#    constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n# 2. Let R1 and R2 be the excitation ratios for star_1 (temp T1) and star_2 (temp T2).\n#    R1 = C * exp(-dE / (k * T1))\n#    R2 = C * exp(-dE / (k * T2))\n\n# 3. We are given that R1 = 2 * R2.\n#    C * exp(-dE / (k * T1)) = 2 * C * exp(-dE / (k * T2))\n\n# 4. Canceling C and taking the natural log of both sides gives:\n#    -dE / (k * T1) = ln(2) - dE / (k * T2)\n\n# 5. Rearranging the terms to solve for ln(2):\n#    dE / (k * T2) - dE / (k * T1) = ln(2)\n#    (dE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)\n#    (dE / k) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2) ) = ln(2)\n\n# 6. The problem provides the values needed to calculate the dE/k term.\n#    dE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\n#    k (Boltzmann constant) = 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K\n#    The ratio dE/k is approximately 1.\n\n# 7. Substituting dE/k = 1 into the equation:\n#    1 * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2) ) = ln(2)\n#    This simplifies to: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 * T2)\n\n# 8. This derived equation matches option B.\ncorrect_option = 'B'\nprint(f\"The derivation shows that the correct equation is: ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
