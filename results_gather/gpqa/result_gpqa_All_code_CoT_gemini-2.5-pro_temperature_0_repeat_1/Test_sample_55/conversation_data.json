    "This is a quantum mechanics problem about atomic transitions. I will solve it by applying the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and calculating the corresponding probabilities (branching ratios).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the transitions:** The problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the final state |n=1, l=0, m=0>. I need to find the valid intermediate state(s).\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition, the change in quantum numbers must obey:\n    *   Δl = ±1\n    *   Δm = 0, ±1\n3.  **First Transition (|3,0,0> → intermediate):**\n    *   The initial state has l=0. To satisfy Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l'=1.\n    *   The initial state has m=0. To satisfy Δm = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   The problem states the intermediate state has n=2. So, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, and |2,1,-1>.\n4.  **Second Transition (intermediate → |1,0,0>):**\n    *   The intermediate states have l'=1. The final state has l''=0. This gives Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n    *   The transition from any of the m' sublevels to m''=0 is also allowed by the Δm selection rule.\n5.  **Calculate Probabilities:**\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0). When it decays, it has an equal probability of transitioning into any of the allowed magnetic sublevels (m') of the next energy level. Since there are three possible m' states (-1, 0, 1), the probability of entering any specific one (e.g., |2,1,0>) is 1/3.\n    *   For the second step, once the atom is in an intermediate state like |2,1,0>, its only allowed dipole decay path to the n=1 shell is to the |1,0,0> state. Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1.\n6.  **Total Probability:** The total probability of a specific cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, the probability is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n7.  **Conclusion:** I will write a Python script to formalize this logic and compare the result with the given options to find the correct one.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_atomic_transition():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the atomic transition problem by applying selection rules and calculating probabilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define states in |n, l, m> notation\n    initial_state = {'n': 3, 'l': 0, 'm': 0}\n    final_state = {'n': 1, 'l': 0, 'm': 0}\n    intermediate_n = 2\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the first transition: |3,0,0> -> |2,l',m'> ---\n\n    # Apply selection rule delta_l = +/- 1\n    # l' = l_initial +/- 1 = 0 +/- 1.
