    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this special relativity problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physics Principle:** The problem describes a scenario where time passes differently for a moving observer (the astronaut) compared to a stationary observer (e.g., on Earth). This phenomenon is known as **time dilation** in Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Gather the Necessary Information:**\n    *   **Speed (v):** The spacecraft travels at `v = 0.99999987 * c`, where `c` is the speed of light. This means the ratio `v/c` is `0.99999987`.\n    *   **Distance (d):** The destination is Earth, and the starting point is the Large Magellanic Cloud. I will use a standard astronomical value for this distance, which is approximately 160,000 light-years.\n    *   **Astronaut's Age:** 22 years (This is relevant to check if they survive, but not for the duration of the trip itself).\n    *   **Alien Lifespan:** 150 years.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   The core formula for time dilation is: `t' = t / γ`\n        *   `t'` is the \"proper time,\" the time experienced by the moving astronaut. This is what we need to find.\n        *   `t` is the time measured by a stationary observer (e.g., on Earth).\n        *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))`.\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n    *   **Step A: Calculate `t` (time in stationary frame):**\n        *   Time = Distance / Speed.\n        *   Since the distance is in light-years and the speed is a fraction of the speed of light (`c`), the calculation is straightforward: `t = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)`. The `c` and `light-years` units effectively cancel, giving the time in years. So, `t ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987` years.\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:**\n        *   Using the formula `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)`, I will plug in `v/c = 0.99999987`.\n    *   **Step C: Calculate `t'` (time for the astronaut):**\n        *   Using the formula `t' = t / γ`, I will divide the result from Step A by the result from Step B.\n    *   **Step D: Compare and Conclude:**\n        *   I will compare the calculated `t'` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the closest match. I will also check if the astronaut's final age (22 + `t'`) is less than their average lifespan of 150 years.\n\nNow, I will implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the constants from the problem ---\n\n# Speed of the spacecraft as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nv_over_c = 0.99999987\n\n# Distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth in light-years.\n# We'll use a standard approximate value.\ndistance_light_years = 160000\n\n# Astronaut's starting age and average lifespan\nastronaut_initial_age = 22\nalien_lifespan = 150\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the time as measured by a stationary observer (e.g., on Earth) ---\n# Time = Distance / Speed. Since distance is in light-years and speed is a fraction of c,\n# the time will be in years.\ntime_stationary_frame = distance_light_years / v_over_c\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\ntry:\n    lorentz_factor = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Error: Calculation resulted in a value outside the valid domain for sqrt.\")\n    lorentz_factor = float('inf')\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) ---\n# t_astronaut = t_stationary / gamma\ntime_astronaut_frame = time_stationary_frame / lorentz_factor\n\n# --- Step 5: Check if the astronaut would survive the journey ---\nfinal_age = astronaut_initial_age + time_astronaut_frame\nsurvives = final_age < alien_lifespan\n\n# --- Step 6: Print the results and the options ---\nprint(f\"Physics Calculation for the Space Journey\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(f\"Assumed Distance to Large Magellanic Cloud: {distance_light_years} light-years\")\nprint(f\"Spacecraft Speed (as fraction of c): {v_over_c}\")\nprint(f\"Time elapsed in stationary frame (Earth): {time_stationary_frame:.2f} years\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Lorentz Factor (gamma): {lorentz_factor:.2f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(f\"Time elapsed for the astronaut on the spacecraft: {time_astronaut_frame:.2f} years\")\nprint(f\"The astronaut's age upon arrival would be: {final_age:.2f} years\")\nprint(f\"Does the astronaut survive the trip? {'Yes' if survives else 'No'}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"Comparing the result with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 77 years\")\nprint(f\"B) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\")\nprint(f\"C) 72 years\")\nprint(f\"D) 81 years\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated journey duration for the astronaut is approximately 81.58 years, which is closest to option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
