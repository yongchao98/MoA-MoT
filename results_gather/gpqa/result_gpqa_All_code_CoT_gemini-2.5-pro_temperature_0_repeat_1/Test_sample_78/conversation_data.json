    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra:** The first step is to determine the structure of the reaction product using the provided 1H and 13C NMR data.\n    *   **13C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl (C=O). The signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two methyl (CH3) carbons. The remaining six signals are in the aromatic/alkene region (120-150 ppm). The presence of signals integrating to 2 carbons each (126.9 (2C), 129.1 (2C)) suggests a symmetrically substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **1H NMR:** The pattern of two doublets at δ 7.71 (2H) and δ 7.08 (2H) is a classic signature for a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at δ 2.31 (3H) is consistent with a methyl group attached to this benzene ring (a tolyl group). The other singlet at δ 2.28 (3H) corresponds to another methyl group that is not adjacent to any protons. The two doublets at δ 7.68 (1H) and δ 6.75 (1H) indicate two protons on a double bond that are coupled to each other (a -CH=CH- group).\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        *   We have a `p-tolyl` group (a methyl group on a para-substituted benzene ring).\n        *   We have a ketone (`C=O`).\n        *   We have another methyl group (`CH3`).\n        *   We have a `-CH=CH-` group.\n        *   The molecular formula is C11H12O.\n        *   The structure that fits all this data is (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, which has the structure: `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`. This structure has two distinct methyl groups appearing as singlets, a `p-tolyl` group, and a `-CH=CH-` group conjugated with the ketone, which explains all the signals and their multiplicities.\n\n2.  **Relate the Product to the Starting Material (Compound X):** The reaction is a rearrangement, meaning the product and the starting material (Compound X) are isomers. They must have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and the same fundamental carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options for Compound X:**\n    *   The product contains a `p-tolyl` group. Therefore, the starting material must also contain a `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a `phenyl` group, not a `p-tolyl` group. Incorrect.\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** Contains a `4-methylphenyl` group, which is a `p-tolyl` group. The formula is C11H12O. This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a `phenyl` group, not a `p-tolyl` group. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** The formula is C10H10O, which does not match C11H12O. Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only option B has the correct molecular formula and the necessary `p-tolyl` structural unit that is present in the final product. The reaction is a known type of rearrangement where a vinyloxirane is converted into an unsaturated ketone.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the product structure from the given NMR data.\n# The 13C NMR signal at 197.7 ppm indicates a ketone (C=O).\n# The 1H NMR signals at 7.71 ppm (2H, d) and 7.08 ppm (2H, d), along with a methyl singlet at 2.31 ppm (3H), strongly suggest a p-tolyl group.\n# The 1H NMR signals at 7.68 ppm (1H, d) and 6.75 ppm (1H, d) indicate a trans -CH=CH- group.\n# The 1H NMR signal at 2.28 ppm (3H, s) indicates a methyl group attached to a carbon with no protons, such as a ketone's carbonyl carbon.\n# Assembling these pieces gives the product: (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n# Product structure: p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3.\n# This product has the formula C11H12O.\n\n# Step 2: The reaction is an isomerization/rearrangement.\n# This means the starting material, Compound X, must have the same molecular formula (C11H12O) and the same core structure as the product.\n# Specifically, the starting material must also contain a p-tolyl group (p-CH3-C6H4-).\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the given options for Compound X.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane\", # Contains a phenyl group, not p-tolyl.\n    \"B\": \"2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane\",         # Contains a 4-methylphenyl (p-tolyl) group.
