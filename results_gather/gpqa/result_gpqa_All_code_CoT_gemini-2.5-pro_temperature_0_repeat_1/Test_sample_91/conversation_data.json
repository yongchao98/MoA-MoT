    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Structure and Formula:** First, we need to understand the structure of the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2` to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and the number of each type of bond (C-H, C-C, C=C).\n2.  **Count Atoms and Bonds:**\n    *   Count the total number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms to get the molecular formula (CxHy).\n    *   Count the number of C-H single bonds.\n    *   Count the number of C-C single bonds.\n    *   Count the number of C=C double bonds.\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** This is the energy required to break the elements in their standard states (C in solid form, H2 in gas form) into individual gaseous atoms.\n    *   The reaction is: `x C(s) + (y/2) H2(g) -> x C(g) + y H(g)`.\n    *   The total enthalpy for this process is `(x * Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (y/2 * Bond energy of H-H)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound:** This is the energy required to break one mole of the compound into its constituent gaseous atoms.\n    *   The reaction is: `CxHy(g) -> x C(g) + y H(g)`.\n    *   The total enthalpy for this is the sum of the energies of all bonds in the molecule: `(Number of C-H bonds * BE_C-H) + (Number of C-C bonds * BE_C-C) + (Number of C=C bonds * BE_C=C)`.\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when the compound is formed from its atoms (which is the negative of the total bond energy).\n    *   `ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements) - (Total Bond Energy of Compound)`. The result will be in kJ/mol.\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value might be in kJ/mol, but the options could be in kJ/g. If necessary, calculate the molar mass of the compound and convert the result to kJ/g to find the correct option.\n\nNow, let's apply this plan in the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Define the structure and count atoms and bonds for (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n# Molecular Formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Bond Counts:\n# C-H bonds: 2*(CH3) + CH + CH2 + CH + (CH3) + CH2 + CH + 2*(CH3) = 6+1+2+1+3+2+1+6 = 22\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\n# C=C bonds: There are two double bonds in the main chain.\nnum_C_double_bonds = 2\n# C-C bonds: Total C-C and C=C bonds in a 12-carbon chain/branched structure is 11.\n# Since there are 2 C=C bonds, there must be 11-2=9 C-C single bonds.\n# Let's verify: (CH3)2C- (2) + -C-C- (1) + -C-C- (1) + -C(CH3)- (1) + -C-C- (1) + -C-C- (1) + =C(CH3)2 (2) = 9\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\n\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_double_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements (12 C and 22 H)\n# We need 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\n# 22 moles of H(g) are formed from 11 moles of H2(g).\ntotal_enthalpy_atomization_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H / 2 * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total bond energy of the compound\n# This is the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of the compound.\ntotal_bond_energy_compound = (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH) + \\\n                             (num_CC_single_bonds * bond_energy_CC) + \\\n                             (num_C_double_bonds * bond_energy_C_double_C)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol\n# ΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (Sum of bond energies of the compound)\nenthalpy_of_formation_kj_mol = total_enthalpy_atomization_elements - total_bond_energy_compound\n\n# Step 6: Compare with options, converting units if necessary\n# Calculate molar mass of C12H22 (using C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol for simplicity as per problem's round numbers)\nmolar_mass = num_C * 12 + num_H * 1\n# Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nenthalpy_of_formation_kj_g = enthalpy_of_formation_kj_mol / molar_mass\n\n# Print the results and compare with the given options\nprint(f\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\nprint(f\"1.
