    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its carbon skeleton.\n    *   `cyclohex`: A 6-carbon ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group, adding 1 carbon.\n    *   `formyl`: A -CHO group, adding 1 carbon.\n    *   `vinyl`: A -CH=CH2 group, adding 2 carbons.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10. The molecule contains one ring.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This is a very strong reducing agent known for the Clemmensen-like reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and the saturation of double/triple bonds.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a single bond (making it an ethyl group).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:** The reaction removes all double bonds and oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon. The original ring structure remains.\n    *   The carbon count stays the same: 10 carbons.\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane (a substituted cyclohexane).\n    *   The general molecular formula for a cycloalkane with 'n' carbon atoms is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   For our product with 10 carbons, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for IHD is: `IHD = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a hydrocarbon).\n    *   Using the product's formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n        *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        *   IHD = 1\n    *   Alternatively, since the final product is a saturated cycloalkane, it contains one ring and zero pi bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final IHD based on this analysis.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the number of carbon atoms in the reactant.\n# Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n# - cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons\n# - carboxylic acid group (-COOH): 1 carbon\n# - formyl group (-CHO): 1 carbon\n# - vinyl group (-CH=CH2): 2 carbons\nnum_carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2\n\n# Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product type.\n# The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n# It converts all oxygenated functional groups and double bonds into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n# The original ring structure remains.\n# Therefore, the product is a cycloalkane.\n\n# Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n# The number of carbons remains the same.\n# The general formula for a cycloalkane with 'n' carbons is C_n H_{2n}.\nnum_hydrogens_product = 2 * num_carbons\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.\n# The IHD formula for a hydrocarbon (C_c H_h) is: IHD = c - h/2 + 1\nihd_product = num_carbons - (num_hydrogens_product / 2) + 1\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the corresponding option.\nprint(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the product is: {num_carbons}\")\nprint(f\"The molecular formula of the saturated cycloalkane product is: C{num_carbons}H{int(num_hydrogens_product)}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product is: {int(ihd_product)}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n\n# The options are: A) 0, B) 5, C) 3, D) 1\n# Our calculated IHD is 1.\nfinal_choice = \"D\"\nprint(f\"The correct option is: {final_choice}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
