    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's temperature (T_star), the star's radius (R_star), the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a), and its albedo (A). The formula is T_eq ∝ T_star * sqrt(R_star / a) * (1 - A)^(1/4). When we take the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, the terms for the star (T_star, R_star) cancel out. Since the problem states the albedo is the same for both planets, that term also cancels. This leaves us with a simplified relationship: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).\n\n3.  **Find the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a2 / a1):** We are not given the semi-major axes directly, but we can derive them from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the formula: K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a).\n\n4.  **Relate RV to Doppler Shift:** The RV semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) observed in the star's spectrum (K ∝ Δλ). Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n\n5.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    *   From K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a), we can rearrange to get a ∝ (M_p / K)².\n    *   This means the ratio a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)².\n    *   Substituting K1/K2 with Δλ1/Δλ2, we get a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)².\n\n6.  **Calculate and Conclude:** I will use the given values for planet masses and Doppler shifts to calculate the ratio a2 / a1. Then, I will take the square root of that result to find the final temperature ratio, T_eq1 / T_eq2, and match it to the closest option.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the given physical quantities ---\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate intermediate ratios ---\n# The ratio of the planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio_2_to_1 = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to the Doppler shift (delta_lambda).\n# Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2.\nK_ratio_1_to_2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) ---\n# The semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (M_p / K)^2.\n# Therefore, the ratio a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2.\na_ratio_2_to_1 = (mass_ratio_2_to_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_to_2)**2\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the final ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) ---\n# The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a).\n# Therefore, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).\nT_eq_ratio_1_to_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_to_1)\n\n# --- Step 5: Print the final result and the options ---\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1 / Planet2) is: {T_eq_ratio_1_to_2:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nAvailable options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
