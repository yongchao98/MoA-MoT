    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, we will follow a systematic approach based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The group with the highest priority according to IUPAC rules will define the parent name of the molecule and receive the locant (position number) '1'. The priority order for the given groups is: Carboxylic acid > Aldehyde > Nitrile > Alcohol > Amine > Ether. Thus, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the principal group, and the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure and Numbering:**\n    *   The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n    *   We place the other substituents based on the description:\n        *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) are meta to the -COOH (at C3/C5) and meta to each other. This places them at C3 and C5.\n        *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the -COOH, placing it at C4.\n        *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the -COOH, placing them at C2 and C6.\n        *   A key piece of information is that the methoxy (at C4) and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. If the nitrile is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. This fits perfectly, placing the hydroxyl at C2.\n        *   This leaves the dimethylamino group to be at C6.\n    *   So, the initial placement is: C1:-COOH, C2:-OH, C3:-CN, C4:-OCH3, C5: (empty), C6:-N(CH3)2. But wait, the carbaldehyde is missing. Let's re-read: \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\" This means the three groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Let's restart the placement with this fact: C1:-COOH, C3:-CHO, C5:-CN (or C3:-CN, C5:-CHO).\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\". So, C2 and C6 have -OH and -N(CH3)2.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\". So, C4 has -OCH3.\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile\". The methoxy is at C4. The nitrile must be at C3 or C5. If the nitrile is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. This means the alcohol (-OH) must be at C6. This fits the description.\n    *   This confirms the final structure:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n3.  **Apply the Lowest Locant Rule:**\n    *   With C1 fixed, we can number clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...) or counter-clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...).\n    *   Clockwise numbering gives substituents at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives substituents at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Since the set of locants is identical, we use alphabetical order to break the tie. The substituent that comes first alphabetically should be given the lower number.\n    *   The substituents are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n    *   Let's check the two numbering schemes against the alphabetical list:\n        *   Scheme 1 (C2=dimethylamino, C3=formyl, C4=methoxy, C5=cyano, C6=hydroxy): The first alphabetical group, \"cyano\", gets position 5.\n        *   Scheme 2 (C2=hydroxy, C3=cyano, C4=methoxy, C5=formyl, C6=dimethylamino): The first alphabetical group, \"cyano\", gets position 3.\n    *   Scheme 2 gives the alphabetically first substituent a lower number (3 vs 5), so it is the correct numbering.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    *   Based on the correct numbering (Scheme 2), the substituents and their positions are:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-dimethylamino\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Arranging these alphabetically: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy\n    *   Adding the parent name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** This name matches option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct IUPAC name for the given molecule by following nomenclature rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the principal functional group and parent name.\n    principal_group = \"Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\"\n    parent_name = \"benzoic acid\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The principal functional group is the {principal_group}, making the parent name '{parent_name}'.
