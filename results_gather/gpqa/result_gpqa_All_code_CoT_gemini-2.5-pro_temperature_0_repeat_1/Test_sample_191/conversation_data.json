    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract negative charges and repel positive charges within the conductor.\n    *   A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is necessary to ensure that the electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero, as required for electrostatic equilibrium. The combination of the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` creates zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially uncharged (neutral), and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality of the conductor itself.\n\n2.  **Field at an External Point (P):** The electric field at point P is the vector sum of the fields from all charges. However, due to the shielding effect of the conductor, the field at P is solely determined by the charge on the outer surface. The charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface do not contribute to the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n3.  **Distribution of Outer Charge:** The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical surface of radius `R`. This is because the outer surface is a sphere, and it is shielded from the non-symmetrical arrangement of the charge inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the sphere = Center of the conductor.\n    *   Distance from the center of the conductor to point P = `L`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by the formula for a point charge `+q` at a distance `L`:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols used in the problem\nq, epsilon_o, L, l, s, theta = sympy.symbols('q epsilon_o L l s theta')\n\n# The problem describes a classic electrostatic shielding scenario.\n# 1. A charge +q inside a cavity of a conductor induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity.\n# 2. To maintain the conductor's overall neutrality, a charge of +q is induced on the outer surface.\n# 3. The electric field outside the conductor is produced ONLY by the charge on its outer surface.\n#    The field from the original +q and the induced -q on the inner surface cancel each other out for any point outside the conductor.\n# 4. This +q charge on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly because the outer surface is spherical and is shielded from the interior.\n# 5. The electric field from a uniformly charged spherical shell at an external point is the same as that of a point charge\n#    of the same magnitude located at the center of the shell.\n# 6. The center of the shell is the center of the conductor. The distance from this center to the external point P is given as L.\n\n# Therefore, the electric field E at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge q at a distance L.\n# E = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_o)) * (q / L**2)\n\n# Let's represent the options and identify the correct one.\nk = 1 / (4 * sympy.pi * epsilon_o)\n\noption_A = k * q / (l - s * sympy.cos(theta))**2\noption_B = k * q / l**2\noption_C = k * q / L**2\noption_D = k * q / (l + s * sympy.cos(theta))**2\n\n# Our derived expression for the electric field is E = k * q / L**2, which matches option C.\n\nprint(\"The physical analysis leads to the following conclusion:\")\nprint(\"The electric field at an external point P is determined solely by the charge induced on the outer surface of the conductor.\")\nprint(\"This induced charge is +q and is distributed uniformly over the outer sphere.\")\nprint(\"The field is therefore equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor.\")\nprint(f\"The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L.\")\nprint(f\"Thus, the magnitude of the electric field is E = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_o)) * q / L^2.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this with the given choices:\")\nprint(f\"A) E = 1/(4*pi*epsilon_o) * q/(l - s*cos(theta))^2\")\nprint(f\"B) E = 1/(4*pi*epsilon_o) * q/l^2\")\nprint(f\"C) E = 1/(4*pi*epsilon_o) * q/L^2\")\nprint(f\"D) E = 1/(4*pi*epsilon_o) * q/(l + s*cos(theta))^2\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct choice is C.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
