    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry:** First, I'll calculate the number of moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, present in 0.1 g. This requires its molar mass.\n2.  **Reaction:** The dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid (H⁺) follows the reaction: Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l). From this, I can determine the moles of H⁺ needed to react with the Fe(OH)₃.\n3.  **Excess Acid and pH:** To keep the Fe³⁺ dissolved, the solution must remain acidic. The total amount of acid added must be enough to both react with the Fe(OH)₃ and leave some excess H⁺ ions to maintain a low pH. The final pH is determined by this excess H⁺ in the total 100 cm³ volume.\n4.  **Verification:** The problem provides coupled answers (volume and pH). The most reliable method is to test each option. For each option's given volume of acid, I will calculate:\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added.\n    *   The moles of H⁺ left in excess after the reaction.\n    *   The final concentration of H⁺ in the 100 cm³ solution.\n    *   The resulting pH.\n5.  **Conclusion:** I will then compare the calculated pH with the pH given in the option. The option where the volume and pH are self-consistent is the correct answer. I will also verify that the amount of acid is sufficient to fully react with the Fe(OH)₃.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the required acid volume and resulting pH to dissolve Fe(OH)3,\n    and determines the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants and initial values ---\n    mass_feoh3 = 0.1  # g\n    vol_total_L = 0.1  # 100 cm3 = 0.1 L\n    conc_acid = 0.1  # M\n\n    # Molar masses (g/mol)\n    M_Fe = 55.845\n    M_O = 15.999\n    M_H = 1.008\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3 and H+ needed for reaction ---\n    MM_feoh3 = M_Fe + 3 * (M_O + M_H)\n    moles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / MM_feoh3\n\n    # From the reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe3+ + 3H2O\n    # 3 moles of H+ are needed per mole of Fe(OH)3\n    moles_H_consumed = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n    print(\"--- Initial Calculations ---\")\n    print(f\"Molar Mass of Fe(OH)3: {MM_feoh3:.3f} g/mol\")\n    print(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve: {moles_feoh3:.6f} mol\")\n    print(f\"Moles of H+ needed for stoichiometric reaction: {moles_H_consumed:.6f} mol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Test each multiple-choice option ---\n    options = {\n        'A': {'pH': 2.69, 'vol_cm3': 30.09},\n        'B': {'pH': 3.16, 'vol_cm3': 32.14},\n        'C': {'pH': 4.94, 'vol_cm3': 20.40},\n        'D': {'pH': 2.04, 'vol_cm3': 28.05}\n    }\n\n    correct_option = None\n\n    for choice, values in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\n--- Testing Option {choice} ---\")\n        vol_acid_cm3 = values['vol_cm3']\n        vol_acid_L = vol_acid_cm3 / 1000.0\n        \n        # Moles of H+ added from the acid\n        moles_H_added = conc_acid * vol_acid_L\n        print(f\"Volume of acid: {vol_acid_cm3} cm3\")\n        print(f\"Total moles of H+ added: {moles_H_added:.6f} mol\")\n\n        # Check if enough acid was added to react with all Fe(OH)3\n        if moles_H_added < moles_H_consumed:\n            print(\"Result: Incorrect.
