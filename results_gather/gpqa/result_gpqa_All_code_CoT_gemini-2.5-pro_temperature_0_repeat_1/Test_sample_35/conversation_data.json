    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will use the provided distance of the structure (2.1 Gpc) to estimate its cosmological redshift (z). The redshift tells us how much the universe has expanded while the light was traveling to us. I will use Hubble's Law (v = H₀ * D) and the relation z = v/c for this calculation, assuming a standard value for the Hubble constant (H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc).\n2.  Next, I will use this redshift to calculate the energy that the absorption line had when it was emitted from the source (its \"rest-frame\" energy). The observed energy (3.9 µeV) is lower than the rest-frame energy due to the redshift. The formula is E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z).\n3.  Then, I will compare this calculated rest-frame energy to the energy of well-known spectral lines in astrophysics. I expect it to match the energy of the famous 21-cm line, which arises from neutral atomic hydrogen.\n4.  Finally, based on the identification of the line as the 21-cm line and the fact that it's an *absorption* line, I will determine which component of the Milky Way's interstellar medium is the most likely source. Absorption lines of this type are characteristic of cold gas clouds. This will lead to the correct choice among the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Planck's constant in eV*s\nh_eVs = 4.1357e-15\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc_kms = 3.0e5\n# A standard value for the Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nH0_kms_Mpc = 70\n\n# Given values from the problem\n# Distance in gigaparsecs (Gpc)\nD_Gpc = 2.1\n# Observed energy in micro-electron-volts (ueV)\nE_obs_ueV = 3.9\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the cosmological redshift (z)\n# Convert distance from Gpc to Mpc (megaparsecs)\nD_Mpc = D_Gpc * 1000\n# Calculate recessional velocity using Hubble's Law: v = H0 * D\nv_kms = H0_kms_Mpc * D_Mpc\n# Calculate redshift: z = v / c\nz = v_kms / c_kms\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rest-frame energy of the absorption line\n# Convert observed energy from ueV to eV\nE_obs_eV = E_obs_ueV * 1e-6\n# Calculate rest-frame energy: E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z)\nE_rest_eV = E_obs_eV * (1 + z)\n# Convert rest-frame energy back to ueV for easier comparison\nE_rest_ueV = E_rest_eV * 1e6\n\n# Step 4: Compare with the energy of the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen\n# The frequency of the 21-cm line is 1420.40575 MHz\nf_21cm_Hz = 1420.40575e6\n# Calculate the energy of the 21-cm line using E = h*f\nE_21cm_eV = h_eVs * f_21cm_Hz\nE_21cm_ueV = E_21cm_eV * 1e6\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and reasoning\nprint(\"--- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\")\nprint(f\"1.
