    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Materials and Products:** The starting materials are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which has a chiral center at carbon-3. The products are stereoisomers of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a lactone with a chiral center at carbon-4. The reactions involve converting the starting material into the lactone, and the key is to understand how the stereochemistry is affected.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reagent:** `LiBH4` (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Transformation:** `LiBH4` will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`) at C-5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group at C-1 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The product of this reduction is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    *   **Final Step:** Under acidic workup (`H+`), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** None of the reaction steps (reduction of the ester, lactonization) involve breaking bonds at the chiral center (C-3 of the starting material, which becomes C-4 of the product). Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the product is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reagent:** `BH3` (Borane) is another reducing agent. It is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters.\n    *   **Transformation:** `BH3` will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C-1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The isobutyl ester group at C-5 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The product of this reduction is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    *   **Final Step:** This hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the same lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, with the elimination of isobutanol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to the first reaction, the reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemical configuration is retained.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n4.  **Final Selection:** Based on the analysis, A is the (R)-isomer and B is the (S)-isomer. This matches option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the two chemical reactions to determine the correct starting materials.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the selectivity of the reducing agents.\n    # LiBH4 selectively reduces esters over carboxylic acids.\n    # BH3 selectively reduces carboxylic acids over esters.\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1.\n    # A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n    # LiBH4 reduces the ester group of A.
