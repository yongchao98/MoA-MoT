    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Diels-Alder reaction and stereochemistry. Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the correct product.\n\n**1. Identify the Diene and Dienophile:**\n*   **Diene:** 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene is an aromatic heterocycle, but it can act as a conjugated diene in a [4+2] cycloaddition under thermal conditions. The diene system involves carbons C2, C3, C4, and C5.\n*   **Dienophile:** Furan-2,5-dione, more commonly known as maleic anhydride. It is an excellent, electron-poor dienophile.\n\n**2. Predict the Basic Structure of the Adduct:**\n*   The reaction forms a new six-membered ring. Since the diene is cyclic, the product is a bridged bicyclic compound.\n*   The sulfur atom from the thiophene ring does not participate in the pi system directly but becomes the one-atom bridge in the product. The product is therefore a 7-thiabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n*   The name of such a structure will contain the term \"epithio\" to denote the sulfur bridge. This immediately eliminates options A and C, which describe an \"epoxy\" (oxygen) bridge. The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (EXO vs. ENDO):**\n*   The question specifically asks for the **EXO** product.\n*   In the context of bridged bicyclic systems like this, the EXO adduct is the one where the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are on the same side as the main bridge (the sulfur atom). The ENDO product, which is often the kinetic product, would have the anhydride ring on the opposite side of the sulfur bridge.\n*   So, we are looking for the structure where the anhydride ring and the sulfur bridge are *syn* to each other.\n\n**4. Assign the Absolute Configuration (R/S) for the EXO Adduct:**\n*   The final step is to determine the correct stereochemical descriptors (R/S) for the four chiral centers (3a, 4, 7, 7a) in the EXO adduct. Let's analyze one of the two possible enantiomers.\n*   Let's draw the EXO adduct with the sulfur bridge pointing \"up\" and the anhydride ring also pointing \"up\".\n    *   **Center C4:** The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities are: (1) -S-, (2) -C7- (the other bridgehead), (3) -C3a-, (4) -CH3. Viewing down the C4-CH3 bond (lowest priority), the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise. Thus, C4 is **R**.\n    *   **Center C7:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, C7 will have the opposite configuration to C4. Thus, C7 is **S**.\n    *   **Center C3a:** The priorities are: (1) -C4-, (2) -C7a-, (3) -C(=O)-, (4) -H. The hydrogen is in the ENDO position (pointing \"down\"). Viewing from the top (opposite the H), the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise. Thus, C3a is **R**.\n    *   **Center C7a:** By symmetry, C7a will have the opposite configuration to C3a. Thus, C7a is **S**.\n*   The resulting configuration for this enantiomer is (3aR, 4R, 7S, 7aS).\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n*   The calculated stereochemistry (3aR, 4R, 7S, 7aS) for the EXO adduct matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_cycloaddition():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the [4+2] cycloaddition problem by following these steps:\n    1.
