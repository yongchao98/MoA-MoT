    "My plan is to first decipher the common chemistry lab slang \"on top of each other\". This phrase almost always refers to a problem with separating different chemical compounds from a mixture. The most common method for separation in a synthetic organic chemistry lab is chromatography. I will then analyze how each multiple-choice option relates to the principles of chromatography to find the most likely answer.\n\n1.  **Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab, where purification of a desired product from a reaction mixture is a critical and frequent task.\n2.  **The Phrase:** \"On top of each other\" is a visual metaphor for compounds that cannot be resolved (separated) during a purification procedure.\n3.  **The Technique:** The workhorse separation technique in this context is chromatography (e.g., Thin Layer Chromatography [TLC] or column chromatography). This powerful technique separates compounds based on differences in their polarity.\n4.  **Analysis of Options:**\n    *   In chromatography, a mixture is passed through a stationary phase (like polar silica gel) using a mobile phase (a solvent). Compounds with different polarities travel at different speeds, allowing them to be separated.\n    *   If compounds have very **similar polarities (Option D)**, they will travel at nearly the same speed. On a TLC plate, their spots will overlap, literally appearing \"on top of each other\". In column chromatography, they will elute from the column at the same time, making it impossible to collect pure samples. This perfectly matches the chemist's complaint.\n    *   **Similar boiling points (Option C)** would be a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography. While possible, the phrase is much more strongly and commonly associated with the visual results of chromatography.\n    *   **Similar optical rotations (Option A)** is a physical property used for characterization, not a basis for the most common types of separation.\n    *   **Non-covalent interactions (Option B)** are the fundamental reason for physical properties like polarity, but \"similar polarities\" is the direct, observable property causing the specific separation problem described.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The most direct and common reason for a chemist to say their compounds are \"on top of each other\" is that they have similar polarities, making them very difficult to separate by chromatography.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks to interpret a common phrase used by chemists in a lab setting.\n# The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a colloquialism for a failed or difficult separation of a chemical mixture.\n# The most common method for purification in synthetic organic chemistry is chromatography, which separates compounds based on their polarity.\n# If compounds have very similar polarities, they will move at nearly the same rate through a chromatography system (like a TLC plate or a column).\n# This results in them not separating and appearing as overlapping spots or eluting at the same time.\n# Therefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the compounds having similar polarities.\n\n# The correct choice is D.\nprint(\"D\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
