    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are radioactive decay and time dilation from special relativity.\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:** The fraction of particles (N/N₀) that survive after a time 't' is given by the exponential decay law: `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n3.  **Incorporate Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor (γ): `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n4.  **Calculate Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes to travel the detector radius `R` is `t = R / c`.\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Substituting the expressions for time and lifetime into the decay equation, we get:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`, which depends on the detector and the particle type, but not on the Lorentz factor. The equation simplifies to:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n6.  **Solve for the Constant K:** Using the initial conditions (γ₁ = 20, N/N₀ = 1/3), we can solve for `K`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`, which gives `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n7.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** Now, we use the value of `K` and the desired fraction (N/N₀ = 2/3) to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`, which gives `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the expression for `K` into the equation for `γ₂` and compute the numerical result.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n9.  **Select the Closest Option:** Compare the calculated value of `γ₂` with the given choices (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial conditions\ngamma1 = 20\nfraction1 = 1/3\n\n# Target condition\nfraction2 = 2/3\n\n# The decay equation is fraction = exp(-K / gamma)\n# From the initial condition, we can find the constant K.\n# ln(fraction1) = -K / gamma1\n# K = -gamma1 * ln(fraction1)\nK = -gamma1 * math.log(fraction1)\n\n# Now we use K to find the new Lorentz factor, gamma2.\n# ln(fraction2) = -K / gamma2\n# gamma2 = -K / ln(fraction2)\ngamma2 = -K / math.log(fraction2)\n\n# Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The initial Lorentz factor is {gamma1} and the survival fraction is {fraction1:.2f}.\")\nprint(f\"To achieve a survival fraction of {fraction2:.2f}, a new Lorentz factor is needed.\")\nprint(f\"Calculated new Lorentz factor (gamma2): {gamma2:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 28\")\nprint(\"B) 40\")\nprint(\"C) 54\")\nprint(\"D) 68\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to 54.\")\n\n# Determine the final choice\noptions = {'A': 28, 'B': 40, 'C': 54, 'D': 68}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - gamma2))\nprint(f\"The closest option is {closest_option}.\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```"
