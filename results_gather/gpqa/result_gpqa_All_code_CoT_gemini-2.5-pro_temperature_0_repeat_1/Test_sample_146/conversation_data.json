    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n2.  **Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**: The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving\", we can assume both particles are effectively at rest. Therefore, their total energy is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $938.27 \\text{ MeV}$, and an antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n3.  **Calculate the Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**: The final state consists of four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since the initial momentum is zero, the final particles must move with some velocity to conserve energy. The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$. The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n4.  **Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: By equating the initial and final energies ($E_{initial} = E_{final}$), we can solve for $\\gamma$.\n    $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity (v)**: Once we have the value for $\\gamma$, we can solve for the velocity $v$ (as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$) using the definition of the Lorentz factor.\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n6.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and determine which of the given options is correct.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the known physical constants in MeV.\n# Rest mass energy of a proton (and antiproton).\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # MeV\n# Rest mass energy of particle A.\nm_a_c2 = 300.0   # MeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total initial energy.\n# Since the proton and antiproton are at rest, their energy is their rest mass energy.\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Step 3: Set up the equation for the final energy.\n# The final energy is the total relativistic energy of the four A particles.\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_a_c2\n\n# Step 4: Apply conservation of energy (E_initial = E_final) to solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma.\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_a_c2\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_a_c2)\n\n# Step 5: Use the Lorentz factor to calculate the velocity v as a fraction of c (beta = v/c).\n# The formula relating gamma and beta is: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nbeta = math.sqrt(beta_squared)\n\n# Print the result and the choices to identify the correct answer.\nprint(f\"The calculated Lorentz factor (gamma) is: {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is v = {beta:.2f}c\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.96c\")\nprint(\"B) 0.86c\")\nprint(\"C) 0.91c\")\nprint(\"D) 0.77c\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option D.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
