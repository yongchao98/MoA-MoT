    "To find the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric Tensor:** The line element is given by $ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$. This is a 2D metric in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ can be read off from this expression.\n    $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The metric is defined on the domain where the denominator is positive, i.e., $4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0$, which corresponds to an open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Area Element:** The area element $dA$ is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$.\n    First, we compute the determinant of the metric tensor:\n    $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$\n    Then, we take the square root:\n    $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    So, the area element is $dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Area Integral:** The total area $A$ is the integral of the area element over the entire domain, which is the disk $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n    $A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n4.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates:** The integral is much easier to evaluate in polar coordinates. We use the transformation $x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$, $y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$. This gives $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$, and the differential area element becomes $dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$. The domain of integration transforms to $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.\n    The integral becomes:\n    $A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^2 \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:** This is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ approaches infinity as $\\rho$ approaches 2. We can evaluate it using a limit, or by symbolic integration. The integral of $\\frac{16}{u}$ (after a substitution $u=4-\\rho^2$) is $16 \\ln|u|$. Evaluating this at the limit where $u \\to 0$ (as $\\rho \\to 2$) shows that the integral diverges to $+\\infty$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this symbolic integration and confirm the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nfrom sympy import pi, oo\n\n# 1. Define symbols for polar coordinates\nrho, theta = sp.symbols('rho theta', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# 2. Define the integrand in polar coordinates\n# The area element sqrt(det(g)) is 32 / (4 - (x^2+y^2)).\n# In polar coordinates, x^2+y^2 = rho^2.\n# The Jacobian for polar coordinates is rho.\n# So the full integrand is (32 / (4 - rho^2)) * rho.\nintegrand_polar = (32 / (4 - rho**2)) * rho\n\n# 3. Set up and evaluate the double integral for the area\n# The limits for rho are from 0 to 2.\n# The limits for theta are from 0 to 2*pi.\n# The integral is improper at rho=2. Sympy can handle this.\narea = sp.integrate(integrand_polar, (rho, 0, 2), (theta, 0, 2*pi))\n\n# 4. Print the result and the choices\nprint(\"The area of the pseudosphere is calculated by the integral:\")\nprint(\"A = integral from 0 to 2*pi (integral from 0 to 2 of (32*rho / (4 - rho^2)) d(rho)) d(theta)\")\nprint(\"\\nResult of the integration:\")\n# The sympy symbol for infinity is 'oo'.\nprint(f\"Calculated Area = {area}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nWhich of the following is the correct area?\")\nprint(\"A) 4*pi*(x^2 - y^2)\")\nprint(\"B) 0\")\nprint(\"C) +oo\")\nprint(\"D) 4*pi*(x^2 + y^2)\")\n\n# The calculated area is infinite, which corresponds to choice C.\nprint(\"\\nThe result corresponds to choice C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
