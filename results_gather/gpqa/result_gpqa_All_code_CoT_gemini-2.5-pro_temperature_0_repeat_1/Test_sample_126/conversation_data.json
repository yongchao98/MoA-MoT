    "The user wants to find the product of a chemical reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Conditions:**\n*   **Reactant:** 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   `nona`: A 9-carbon parent chain.\n    *   `-2,6-diene`: Double bonds are located between carbons 2-3 and 6-7.\n    *   `5-butyl`: A butyl group (-C4H9) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH2(4)-CH(Butyl)(5)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH2-CH3`\n*   **Conditions:** The molecule is heated.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction Type:**\n*   The reactant, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, contains a `C=C-C-C-C=C` structural motif (specifically, atoms C2 through C7). This is a 1,5-diene system.\n*   Heating a 1,5-diene is the classic condition for a **Cope rearrangement**, which is a type of [3,3]-sigmatropic pericyclic reaction.\n\n**3. Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n*   In a Cope rearrangement of a 1,5-diene system (`C1=C2-C3-C4-C5=C6`), the following bond changes occur:\n    *   The sigma bond between C3 and C4 is broken.\n    *   A new sigma bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    *   The pi bond at C1=C2 moves to C2=C3.\n    *   The pi bond at C5=C6 moves to C4=C5.\n*   Let's apply this to our molecule's system (`C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`):\n    *   The bond between C4 and C5 breaks.\n    *   A new bond forms between C2 and C7.\n    *   The double bond at C2=C3 moves to C3=C4.\n    *   The double bond at C6=C7 moves to C5=C6.\n\n**4. Determine the Product Structure:**\n*   Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms after the rearrangement.\n    *   The molecule effectively splits at the C4-C5 bond and reconnects at C2 and C7.\n    *   Let's consider the two fragments that result from breaking the C4-C5 bond:\n        *   Fragment 1: `CH3-CH=CH-CH2-` (from C1 to C4)\n        *   Fragment 2: `-CH(Butyl)-CH=CH-CH2-CH3` (from C5 to C9)\n    *   The rearrangement transforms these fragments and connects them differently.\n        *   Fragment 1 becomes `(CH3)CH-CH=CH2`. The connection point moves from C4 to C2.\n        *   Fragment 2 becomes `(Butyl)C=CH-CH(CH2CH3)`. The connection point moves from C5 to C7.\n    *   Connecting the new points (C2 and C7) gives the product:\n        `CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-(CH2CH2CH2CH3)`\n\n**5. Name the Product:**\n*   Now we apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the product structure:\n    `CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH2CH3`\n    1.  **Find the longest carbon chain** that contains both double bonds. The longest such chain has 10 carbon atoms (deca-).\n        `CH2(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH(5)=CH(6)-CH2(7)-CH2(8)-CH2(9)-CH3(10)`\n    2.  **Number the chain** to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the left gives the double bonds at positions 1 and 5 (`-1,5-diene`). Numbering from the right would give higher numbers.\n    3.  **Identify and locate the substituents.**\n        *   A methyl group (-CH3) is on carbon 3.\n        *   An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is on carbon 4.\n    4.  **Assemble the name.** Alphabetize the substituents (ethyl before methyl).\n        The full name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options:**\n*   A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n*   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n*   C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n*   D) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n\nOur derived name matches option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the reactant and reaction conditions.\")\n    print(\"Reactant: 5-butylnona-2,6-diene\")\n    print(\"Conditions: Heating\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify the reaction type.\")\n    print(\"The reactant is a 1,5-diene.
