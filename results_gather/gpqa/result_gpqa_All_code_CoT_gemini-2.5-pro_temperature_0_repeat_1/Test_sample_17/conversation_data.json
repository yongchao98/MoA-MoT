    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of silicon abundances in Star 1 and Star 2. In stellar astronomy, \"abundance\" typically refers to the number of atoms of an element relative to the number of hydrogen atoms. Therefore, we need to calculate the ratio `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\n2.  **Use the Abundance Notation:** The notation `[X/Y]` is defined as `log10( (nX/nY)_star ) - log10( (nX/nY)_sun )`. A useful identity derived from this is `[X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Silicon Abundance for Star 1:**\n    *   We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0.0`.\n    *   Using the identity, we can find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star 1, `[Si/H]_1`:\n        `[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0.0 = 0.3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Silicon Abundance for Star 2:**\n    *   We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0.0`.\n    *   We can rearrange the identity to solve for the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star 2, `[Si/H]_2`:\n        `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`\n        `0.0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2`\n        `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   We need to find `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n    *   From the definition of `[Si/H]`, we know:\n        `(nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^[Si/H]_1`\n        `(nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^[Si/H]_2`\n    *   The ratio is therefore:\n        `Ratio = ( (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^[Si/H]_1 ) / ( (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^[Si/H]_2 )`\n    *   The solar abundance term `(nSi/nH)_sun` cancels out, leaving:\n        `Ratio = 10^[Si/H]_1 / 10^[Si/H]_2 = 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)`\n    *   Substituting the values we found:\n        `Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`.\n\n6.  **Code the Calculation:** The Python code will perform these calculations to find the numerical value of `10^0.6` and compare it to the given options. The stellar masses and solar abundances for Fe and Mg are not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given abundance ratios for each star.\n# For Star 1\nSi_Fe_1 = 0.3  # [Si/Fe]_1\nFe_H_1 = 0.0   # [Fe/H]_1\n\n# For Star 2\nMg_Si_2 = 0.3  # [Mg/Si]_2\nMg_H_2 = 0.0   # [Mg/H]_2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, [Si/H], for Star 1.\n# We use the identity: [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]\nSi_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, [Si/H], for Star 2.\n# We use the identity: [Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H], rearranged to solve for [Si/H].\n# [Si/H] = [Mg/H] - [Mg/Si]\nSi_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final ratio of silicon abundances.\n# The ratio (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 is equal to 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2).\nratio = 10**(Si_H_1 - Si_H_2)\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of silicon atoms (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 is: {ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~0.8\")\nprint(f\"B) ~12.6\")\nprint(f\"C) ~3.9\")\nprint(f\"D) ~1.2\")\n\n# The calculated value ~3.98 is closest to 3.9.\n```\n<<<C>>>"
