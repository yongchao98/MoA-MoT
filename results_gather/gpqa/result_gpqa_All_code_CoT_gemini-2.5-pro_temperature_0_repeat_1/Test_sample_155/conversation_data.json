    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical reactions and the resulting analysis:\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (Z)-oct-4-ene with the same sequence of reagents.\n3.  **Combine Products:** Identify all the unique stereoisomers present in the final mixture from both reactions.\n4.  **Predict HPLC Results:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers. Enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique can separate all stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n5.  **Select the Correct Option:** Based on the number of predicted peaks for each HPLC method, choose the corresponding option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function logically determines the number of peaks in standard and chiral HPLC\n    for a mixture of reaction products.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the products of each reaction\n    # Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene -> meso-epoxide -> racemic diol\n    # (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene.
