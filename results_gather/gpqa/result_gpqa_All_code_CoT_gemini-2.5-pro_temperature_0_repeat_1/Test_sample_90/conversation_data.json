    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product structure.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1 (Aldol Addition)**\n*   First, cyclohexanone is treated with LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide), a strong, bulky base. LDA removes a proton from the alpha-carbon of cyclohexanone to form a lithium enolate.\n*   This enolate is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.\n*   Finally, the reaction mixture is acidified. This protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form a β-hydroxy ketone, which is Product 1. The structure of Product 1 is 2-(hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   This reaction creates two new stereocenters. The reaction between a cyclic ketone enolate and an aldehyde generally favors the *syn* diastereomer. We will consider the (2R, S) isomer as the major product for the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2 (Fluorination with DAST)**\n*   Product 1 is treated with an *excess* of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST, Et₂NSF₃). DAST is a versatile fluorinating agent.\n*   Because an excess of DAST is used, it will react with both the alcohol and the ketone functional groups in Product 1.\n*   The ketone (C=O) at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring is converted into a geminal difluoride (CF₂).\n*   The secondary alcohol (-OH) on the side chain is converted into a fluoride (-F). This specific reaction with DAST proceeds with an *inversion* of stereochemistry at that carbon.\n\n**Determining the Structure and Stereochemistry of Product 2**\n*   The basic structure of Product 2 is a 1,1-difluorocyclohexane ring with a fluoro(phenyl)methyl group at the C2 position. This immediately eliminates options C and D, which still contain an alcohol or a ketone, respectively.\n*   Now we must determine the correct stereochemistry to choose between A and B. We start with the major *syn* aldol product, (2R)-2-((S)-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The ketone at C1 becomes a CF₂ group. The stereocenter at C2 is not affected by this reaction, so it remains (R).\n    *   The secondary alcohol has an (S) configuration. The reaction with DAST inverts this stereocenter to (R).\n*   Therefore, the resulting product has an (R) configuration at C2 of the ring and an (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon (the carbon bearing the fluorine and phenyl group).\n*   This corresponds to the structure named ((R)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step solution to the organic chemistry problem\n    and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the first reaction (Aldol Addition)\n    step1_description = \"Step 1: Cyclohexanone reacts with LDA and then benzaldehyde in an aldol addition.

DAST converts the ketone (C=O) to a geminal difluoride (CF2) and the alcohol (-OH) to a fluoride (-F) with inversion of stereochemistry.\"\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the final product structure and stereochemistry\n    step3_description = \"Step 3: The final structure is a 2-substituted 1,1-difluorocyclohexane. Starting from the major syn-aldol product, (2R, S), the reaction with DAST yields a product with (R) configuration at the ring's C2 and (R) configuration at the benzylic carbon.
