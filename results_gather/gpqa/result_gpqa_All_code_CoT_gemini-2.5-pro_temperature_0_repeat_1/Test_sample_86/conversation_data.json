    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Core Structure:** It's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring, which accounts for 6 of the 8 carbon atoms. This leaves 2 carbon atoms for the two substituents.\n    *   **Substituents (from FTIR):**\n        *   An \"aromatic-halogen bond\" means one substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br) directly attached to the benzene ring. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n        *   A \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) is present.\n    *   **Putting it together:** Since one substituent is a halogen, the other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n2.  **Determine the Full Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom and an acetyl group. This gives a halogenated acetophenone.\n    *   The total formula is C₈H₇XO (where X is a halogen). This has 8 carbons, as required.\n    *   Since it's di-substituted, the two groups can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. The NMR options provided suggest a simple, symmetrical pattern, which strongly points towards a para (1,4) substitution.\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for a para-Halogenated Acetophenone:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to a simplified spectrum.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to the para-substitution, they appear as two distinct signals, each integrating to 2 protons. Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, shifting these protons downfield into the 7.0-8.0 ppm range. The pattern is typically two doublets (an AA'BB' system that looks like two doublets). So, we expect something like: `~7.8 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.6 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Substituent Protons (on the acetyl group):** The acetyl group has a methyl (-CH₃) part. These 3 protons are adjacent to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a singlet (no splitting). Their chemical shift is typically in the 2.0-2.5 ppm range. So, we expect: `~2.3 ppm (3H, s)`.\n    *   **Combined Prediction:** The expected spectrum is approximately `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s):** Incorrect. Does not match the number of aromatic protons or the expected chemical shifts.\n    *   **B) 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s):** Incorrect. The signal at 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde, which would require a -CH₂CHO substituent. While this also has 8 carbons, the aromatic signals (7.8, 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield for a structure where the carbonyl is insulated from the ring by a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):** This option is a perfect match for our predicted spectrum of a para-halogenated acetophenone. It has the correct signals for the aromatic protons and the methyl ketone protons, with the correct integrations and splitting patterns.\n    *   **D) 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s):** Incorrect. Lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical information to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the compound's description.\n    # - Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring -> Substituted benzene\n    # - 8 carbon atoms total -> Benzene (6C) + 2C in substituents\n    # - FTIR: Carbonyl group (C=O) and aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\n    # This means the substituents are a Halogen (-X) and a 2-carbon group with a C=O.\n    # The most plausible 2-carbon group with a C=O is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    # The structure is therefore a halogenated acetophenone.\n    # The NMR data in the options suggests a symmetrical para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution).\n    # The compound is a para-halogenated acetophenone.\n\n    # Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a para-halogenated acetophenone.\n    # - Aromatic protons: 4H on the ring.
