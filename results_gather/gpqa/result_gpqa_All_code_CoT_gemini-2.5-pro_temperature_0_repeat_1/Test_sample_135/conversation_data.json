    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the core physics/math principle:** The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, `∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV`. This is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n2.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:** The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume. Mathematically: `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n3.  **Define the components for the surface integral:**\n    *   The vector field `f` is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   On this surface, the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` in spherical coordinates for a sphere of radius `R` is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`. The direction is outward, which is the `r_hat` direction.\n4.  **Calculate the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:**\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    *   Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies to `(1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ)) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out.\n5.  **Set up and solve the integral:** The problem is now reduced to calculating the surface integral `∮∮ sin(θ) dθ dφ` over the entire sphere. The limits of integration are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n6.  **Use Python for calculation:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform this symbolic double integration and find the final numerical answer. This will give the value for the original volume integral.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, pi\n\n# Step 1: Define the symbolic variables for spherical coordinates.\ntheta, phi, R = sympy.symbols('theta phi R')\n\n# Step 2: Explain the application of the Divergence Theorem.\n# The theorem converts the volume integral of the divergence into a surface integral of the flux.\n# ∫∫∫ (∇⋅f) dV = ∮∮ (f ⋅ dS)\n\n# Step 3: Define the integrand for the surface integral.\n# The vector field on the surface of the sphere (r=R) is f = (1/R**2) * r_hat.\n# The surface element is dS = (R**2 * sin(theta)) * r_hat dθ dφ.\n# The dot product f ⋅ dS simplifies to sin(theta) because the R**2 terms cancel.\nintegrand = sin(theta)\n\n# Step 4: Perform the double integration over the surface of the sphere.\n# The integral for theta is from 0 to pi.\n# The integral for phi is from 0 to 2*pi.\n\n# Integrate with respect to theta first\nintegral_over_theta = sympy.integrate(integrand, (theta, 0, pi))\n\n# Then integrate the result with respect to phi\nfinal_answer = sympy.integrate(integral_over_theta, (phi, 0, 2*pi))\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the available choices.\nprint(\"According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux integral over the enclosing surface.\")\nprint(\"The flux integral is ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ.\")\nprint(f\"The result of the integration is: {final_answer}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe available options are:\")\n# Note: sympy.pi is a symbolic representation, so we use it for printing.\nprint(f\"A) 1\")\nprint(f\"B) {4 * pi}\")\nprint(f\"C) 0\")\nprint(f\"D) 4/3 * pi * R\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
