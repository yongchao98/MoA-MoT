    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the provided DNA sequence to determine why the protein expression failed. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Examine the start of the sequence:** I will check for the standard start codon (`ATG`).\n2.  **Translate the sequence:** I will translate the DNA sequence codon by codon (in groups of three nucleotides) into its corresponding amino acid sequence.\n3.  **Identify key features:** During translation, I will look for the HA tag sequence, the main protein sequence, and any potential anomalies. Specifically, I will be searching for stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`) that might appear before the end of the coding sequence.\n4.  **Evaluate the options:** Based on the analysis, I will determine which of the given options (A, B, C, or D) correctly explains the experimental observation.
