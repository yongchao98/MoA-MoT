    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the non-permitted partial wave:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we get:\n        *   Spin `S_initial = 0` (since `2S+1=1`).\n        *   Orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0` (since `L` is 'S').\n        *   Total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Final State and Decay:** The initial state decays into a final NN state and a particle X (`NN_initial -> NN_final + X`).\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final state's total parity is `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^L(X)`, where `L(X)` is the orbital angular momentum of X.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`.\n    *   So, `P_final = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X) = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X))`.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws and Selection Rules:** For a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions:\n    *   **Parity Conservation:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n        *   `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X))`\n        *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + L(X)) = -1`, which means the sum `L(NN_final) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n    *   **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum vectors must sum correctly. `J_initial = J_final`.\n        *   `J_initial = 0`.\n        *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum, `J(NN_final)`, and the angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)` (assuming X is spinless).\n        *   For the total to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = L(X)`.\n    *   **Pauli Statistics:** The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` must hold.\n        *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   This implies that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be **odd**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option:** We will now write a Python script to check each of the given options against these three rules. The option that fails any one of these rules is the one that is not permitted.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nucleon_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes possible decay channels of a 1S0 nucleon-nucleon system\n    and identifies the one that is not permitted based on conservation laws and Pauli statistics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define spectroscopic notation mapping for orbital angular momentum L\n    L_map = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3, 'G': 4}\n    # Define lowercase notation for the emitted particle's angular momentum\n    l_map = {'s': 0, 'p': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 3}\n\n    # The options for the final state (NN state + emitted particle wave)\n    options = {\n        'A': {'nn_state': '7D1', 'x_wave': 'p'},\n        'B': {'nn_state': '3P0', 'x_wave': 's'},\n        'C': {'nn_state': '3D3', 'x_wave': 'f'},\n        'D': {'nn_state': '3S1', 'x_wave': 'p'},\n    }\n\n    not_permitted_option = None\n\n    # Initial state is 1S0, so J_initial = 0.\n    # Final NN state has T(NN) = 0.\n\n    # --- Summary of Rules for a Permitted Transition ---\n    # 1.
