    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the relevant physical law. The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`, where `L` is luminosity, `R` is the radius, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the surface temperature.\n2.  Determine the relationship between the temperatures of the two stars. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law (`λ_max * T = constant`), if the peak wavelength (`λ_max`) is the same for both stars, their surface temperatures (`T`) must also be the same. Therefore, `T₁ = T₂`.\n3.  Set up the ratio of the luminosities (`L₁ / L₂`). By dividing the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for Star_1 by the one for Star_2, the constants (`4`, `π`, `σ`) cancel out, leaving `L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n4.  Substitute the known values into the ratio equation. We are given `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`, so `R₁/R₂ = 1.5`. We deduced that `T₁ = T₂`, so `T₁/T₂ = 1`.\n5.  Calculate the final ratio. The information about mass and radial velocity is not needed for this calculation.\n6.  Compare the calculated result with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given ratios.\n# The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# Step 2: Determine the temperature ratio.\n# According to Wien's Displacement Law, if the peak emission wavelength is the same,\n# the surface temperature must also be the same.\n# Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is 1.\ntemperature_ratio = 1.0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the luminosity ratio.\n# The luminosity (L) of a star (as a black body) is proportional to R^2 * T^4.\n# The ratio of luminosities L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio ** 2) * (temperature_ratio ** 4)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the options.\nprint(f\"The problem is to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, L1/L2.\")\nprint(f\"The ratio of their radii (R1/R2) is: {radius_ratio}\")\nprint(f\"The ratio of their temperatures (T1/T2) is: {temperature_ratio}\")\nprint(f\"The luminosity ratio L1/L2 is calculated as (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\")\nprint(f\"L1/L2 = {radius_ratio}^2 * {temperature_ratio}^4 = {luminosity_ratio}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~2.25\")\nprint(f\"B) ~2.35\")\nprint(f\"C) ~2.32\")\nprint(f\"D) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated factor is exactly 2.25, which corresponds to option A.\")\n\n# The final answer is A\n<<<A>>>\n```"
