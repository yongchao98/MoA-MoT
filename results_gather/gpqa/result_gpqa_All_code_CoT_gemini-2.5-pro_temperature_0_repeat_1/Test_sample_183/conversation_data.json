    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's look at the substituents and their relative positions:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe molecule has a 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern. The key relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe final steps to create the ethoxy group likely involve converting a phenol (-OH) using Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr). A phenol is often made from an aniline (-NH2) via a diazonium salt. This suggests the following sequence near the end of the synthesis:\n...-NH2  `--(NaNO2/HCl)-->` ...-N2+  `--(H3O+, Heat)-->` ...-OH  `--(NaOH/EtBr)-->` ...-OEt\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's trace each reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine group, deactivating the ring. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group directs *para*, giving 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.\n    iii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration. Both the t-butyl group (*o,p*-director) and the sulfonic acid group (*m*-director) direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group. This gives 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    If we were to proceed, we would eventually get a product where the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta*, not *ortho* as required. Also, step (vi) involves nitrating a diazonium salt, which is not a standard procedure. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This option has incorrect numbering of steps and includes a diazotization step (iv) where there is no amine group to react. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence, assuming the last two steps are extraneous.\n    i) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) **HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. While the *para* isomer is major, the minor *ortho* isomer, **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, is the required intermediate for this path.\n    iii) **Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) **HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the most complex step. Under strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. The -NH3+ group at position 1 directs to positions 3 and 5. The -tBu group at position 2 directs to positions 4 and 6. While the reaction is complex, nitration at position 3 is a possible outcome to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    v) **NaNO2/HCl:** The amine group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a **diazonium salt**.\n    vi) **H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) **NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAlthough steps (ii) and (iv) would not be high-yield, the overall sequence of transformations in Option D is the only one that logically leads to the correct final product structure. The other options contain fundamental chemical errors.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction sequences to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1.  The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n    2.  The ethoxy group is best installed last via Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol.\n    3.  The phenol is best made from an aniline via a diazonium salt.\n    4.  This means the core final steps are: ...-NH2 -> ...-N2+ -> ...-OH -> ...-OEt.\n    5.
