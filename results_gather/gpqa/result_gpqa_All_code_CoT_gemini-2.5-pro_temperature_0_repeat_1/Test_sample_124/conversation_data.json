    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The problem describes a 3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The potential is given by `V(r) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * r^2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Formula:** The energy eigenvalues for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n    `E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω`\n    where `N = n_x + n_y + n_z` is the principal quantum number (`N = 0, 1, 2, ...`), and `n_x, n_y, n_z` are the quantum numbers for the three Cartesian dimensions.\n\n3.  **Identify the State:** We need to find the energy of the \"third excited state\".\n    *   Ground State: `N = 0`\n    *   First Excited State: `N = 1`\n    *   Second Excited State: `N = 2`\n    *   Third Excited State: `N = 3`\n    So, we will use `N = 3` for our calculations.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy:** Substitute `N = 3` into the energy formula:\n    `E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (6/2 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`\n\n5.  **Recall the Degeneracy Formula:** The degeneracy `g_N` (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level `E_N`) for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by:\n    `g_N = (N + 1)(N + 2) / 2`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** Substitute `N = 3` into the degeneracy formula:\n    `g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated energy is `(9/2)ħω` and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option A.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Define the principal quantum number for the third excited state\n# Ground state is N=0, first excited is N=1, second is N=2, so third is N=3.\nN = 3\n\n# --- Energy Calculation ---\n# The energy formula is E_N = (N + 3/2) * h_bar * omega.\n# We calculate the fractional part (N + 3/2).\n# N + 3/2 = (2*N + 3) / 2\nenergy_numerator = 2 * N + 3\nenergy_denominator = 2\n\n# --- Degeneracy Calculation ---\n# The degeneracy formula is g_N = (N + 1) * (N + 2) / 2\ndegeneracy = (N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(f\"For the third excited state, the principal quantum number is N = {N}.\")\nprint(f\"The energy is E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting N = {N}, the energy is ({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator})ħω.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"The degeneracy is g_N = (N + 1)(N + 2) / 2.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting N = {N}, the degeneracy is {degeneracy}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"The calculated energy and degeneracy match option A.\")\n\n# The final answer choice\nfinal_choice = \"A\"\nprint(f\"Energy: ({energy_numerator}/{energy_denominator}) ħω, Degeneracy: {degeneracy}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to choice: {final_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
