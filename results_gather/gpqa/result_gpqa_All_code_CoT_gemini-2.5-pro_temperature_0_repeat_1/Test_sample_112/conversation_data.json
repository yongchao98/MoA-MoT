    "My plan is to deduce the structure of the unknown compound by systematically interpreting the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding causes significant broadening.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   Conclusion from FTIR: The compound is likely a carboxylic acid containing a C=C double bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, as these are hydrogens attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12.01 for C + 16.00 for O + 16.00 for O + 1.01 for H ≈ 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The data strongly suggests the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain:\n        *   A carboxyl group (-COOH), which has two oxygen atoms and one degree of unsaturation (the C=O bond).\n        *   An alkene group (C=C), which contributes another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have **two oxygen atoms** and a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   I will then check which formula has both 2 oxygens and a DoU of 2.\n\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the C=C bond evidence.\n    *   **B) C6H12O:** Has 1 oxygen. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) C6H10O:** Has 1 oxygen. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** Has 2 oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This matches all the evidence: a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens, 1 DoU) with a C=C bond (1 DoU).\n\nThe code below will perform this analysis and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    # Use regex to find the number of C, H, and O atoms.\n    # Assume 0 if the element is not present.\n    c = int(re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula).group(1)) if re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula) else 0\n    h = int(re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula).group(1)) if re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula) else 0\n    # Oxygen does not affect the DoU calculation but we need it for our analysis\n    o = int(re.search(r'O(\\d*)', formula).group(1)) if re.search(r'O(\\d+)', formula) else (1 if re.search(r'O(?!\\d)', formula) else 0)\n\n    dou = c + 1 - (h / 2)\n    return dou, o\n\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the chemical formula based on spectroscopic data.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H12O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H10O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\")\n    print(\"1.
