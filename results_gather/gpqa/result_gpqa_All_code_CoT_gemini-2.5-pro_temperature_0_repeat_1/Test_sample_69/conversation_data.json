    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n**1. Analyze the Hydrolysis Reaction (Reaction 3):**\n*   `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n*   This is the most revealing clue. The reaction of a single substance `C` with water produces two different acids, one strong (`F`) and one weak (`G`). Crucially, the initial solid reactant `A` is reformed.\n*   A common weak acid formed in hydrolysis is hydrofluoric acid (HF). A common strong acid formed alongside it in the hydrolysis of an interhalogen compound is a halic acid (like HBrO₃ or HIO₃).\n*   Let's hypothesize that `G = HF` (weak acid) and `F = HBrO₃` (bromic acid, strong acid).\n*   This implies that compound `C` contains bromine, fluorine, and oxygen (the oxygen comes from the BrO₃ group). The hydrolysis reaction for a compound like bromine trifluoride (BrF₃) is `3BrF₃ + 5H₂O -> HBrO₃ + 2HBr + 9HF`. This is close but produces HBr as well.\n*   A better fit is the hydrolysis of a graphite intercalation compound. Graphite (`A`) can be intercalated with `BrF₃` (`B`) to form `C`. When this compound `C` reacts with water, it releases the intercalated molecules which then hydrolyze, and the graphite structure (`A`) is left behind. The hydrolysis of `BrF₃` in water can be represented as `5BrF₃ + 9H₂O -> 3HBrO₃ + HBr + 15HF`. While complex, it produces the required strong acid (HBrO₃) and weak acid (HF). The regeneration of solid `A` (graphite) is the key.\n*   So, let's identify:\n    *   `A` = **C** (Graphite, a solid)\n    *   `C` = **Cₙ(BrF₃)ₓ** (Graphite intercalated with BrF₃, which can be reddish in color, fitting \"bright red product C\")\n    *   `F` = **HBrO₃** (Bromic acid, strong)\n    *   `G` = **HF** (Hydrofluoric acid, weak)\n\n**2. Analyze the Formation of C (Reaction 1):**\n*   `A(s) + 8 B(g) -> C (bright red)`\n*   This becomes: `C(graphite) + x BrF₃ -> Cₙ(BrF₃)ₓ`.\n*   This identifies `B` as **BrF₃** (Bromine trifluoride), which is a volatile liquid (boiling point 12.5 °C) and can be treated as a gas. The \"8 equivalents\" refers to the stoichiometric ratio of intercalated molecules, which is plausible for such a compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Formation of H (Reaction 4):**\n*   `D(g) + B(g) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   We know `B = BrF₃`. So, `D(g) + BrF₃(g) -> H(solvent)`.\n*   `BrF₃` is a Lewis acid and a Lewis base (due to lone pairs on Br). It can react with a stronger Lewis acid. A classic example is Arsenic pentafluoride (`AsF₅`), which is a gas.\n*   The reaction is `AsF₅ + BrF₃ -> [BrF₂]⁺[AsF₆]⁻`.\n*   The product, `[BrF₂]⁺[AsF₆]⁻`, is an ionic liquid, which fits the description of a \"solvent\". The reaction stoichiometry is 1:1.\n*   So, let's identify:\n    *   `D` = **AsF₅** (Arsenic pentafluoride, a gas)\n    *   `H` = **[BrF₂]⁺[AsF₆]⁻** (a salt that is liquid at/near room temp, i.e., an ionic liquid solvent)\n\n**4. Identify Product E and its Symmetry (Reaction 2):**\n*   `C + 2 D(g) -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n*   This becomes: `Cₙ(BrF₃)ₓ + 2 AsF₅ -> E`.\n*   The reaction will occur between the intercalated `BrF₃` and the gas `AsF₅`. The reaction `BrF₃ + 2AsF₅ -> [BrF₂]⁺[As₂F₁₁]⁻` is known to occur, forming a superacid system.\n*   The product `E` can be identified as the highly reactive cation **[BrF₂]⁺**. This cation is part of a superacid system, making it \"extremely hazardous\".\n*   Now, we must determine the molecular symmetry group of the `[BrF₂]⁺` ion.\n    *   Using VSEPR theory, the central bromine atom has 7 valence electrons. It's in a +3 oxidation state, so it has 7 - (1*2) - 1 = 4 valence electrons left, which form 2 lone pairs.\n    *   The ion has 2 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs (AX₂E₂).\n    *   This leads to a **bent or V-shaped** molecular geometry.\n    *   A bent molecule of the form AX₂ has a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes (one containing the atoms, one bisecting the F-Br-F angle).\n    *   This set of symmetry elements corresponds to the **C₂v** point group.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection:**\n*   The molecular symmetry group of E ([BrF₂]⁺) is C₂v.\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the molecular symmetry group of compound E.\n# Based on the step-by-step chemical deduction:\n# A = C (graphite)\n# B = BrF3 (bromine trifluoride)\n# C = C_n(BrF3)_x (graphite intercalation compound)\n# D = AsF5 (arsenic pentafluoride)\n# E = [BrF2]+ (difluorobrominium(III) cation)\n# F = HBrO3 (bromic acid)\n# G = HF (hydrofluoric acid)\n# H = [BrF2]+[AsF6]- (ionic liquid)\n\n# The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E, which is the [BrF2]+ cation.\n# VSEPR theory predicts a bent shape for [BrF2]+ (2 bonding pairs, 2 lone pairs on Br).\n# A bent AX2 molecule has a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes.\n# This corresponds to the C2v point group.\n\n# The choices are:\n# A) C2\n# B) D∞h\n# C) C2v\n# D) D4h\n\n# Our derived point group is C2v, which is option C.\n\nfinal_choice = \"C\"\n\nprint(f\"The molecular symmetry group of E is predicted to be C2v.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to choice C.\")\nprint(f\"A) C2\")\nprint(f\"B) D∞h\")\nprint(f\"C) C2v\")\nprint(f\"D) D4h\")\nprint(f\"<<<{final_choice}>>>\")\n```"
