    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Apply Conservation Laws**: The decay of a stationary particle is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the decay (the rest energy of the stationary pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2$) must equal the total energy of the products after the decay (the sum of the total energies of the muon, $E_{\\mu}$, and the neutrino, $E_{\\nu}$).\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon ($\\vec{p}_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino ($\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n        $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\implies |\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n2.  **Use Relativistic Formulas**: We will use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$, where $E$ is total energy, $p$ is momentum, and $m_0$ is rest mass.\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu} = KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    *   For the neutrino ($\\nu$): We assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$), so its total energy is purely kinetic and is given by $E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n3.  **Derive and Calculate**: By combining these equations, we can derive a formula for the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):\n    $KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n    Once we calculate $KE_{\\mu}$, we can find the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$) using the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):\n    $Q = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = Q - KE_{\\mu}$\n\n4.  **Write Python Code**: The Python code will implement these formulas to calculate the kinetic energies and identify the correct option from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\n# Rest mass energy of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\n# Rest mass energy of mu(+) in MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# The decay is Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu, with Pi(+) at rest.\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive the kinetic energy of the muon.\n# Formula: KE_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2)^2 / (2 * m_pi*c^2)\nke_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2)**2 / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energies.\nq_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is the remaining energy.\nke_nu = q_value - ke_mu\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(\"Calculation of Kinetic Energies for the decay Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\")\nprint(f\"Rest mass of Pi(+): {m_pi_c2} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest mass of mu(+): {m_mu_c2} MeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Compare with options and print the final answer ---\noptions = {\n    \"A\": (2.84, 26.8),\n    \"B\": (3.52, 20.8),\n    \"C\": (7.2, 32.8),\n    \"D\": (4.12, 29.8)\n}\n\n# Find the option that matches the calculated values\nfor choice, values in options.items():\n    # Check if the calculated values are close to the option values (within a small tolerance)\n    if math.isclose(ke_mu, values[0], rel_tol=1e-2) and math.isclose(ke_nu, values[1], rel_tol=1e-2):\n        print(f\"The calculated values match option {choice}.\")\n        print(f\"Final Answer: The kinetic energies are {values[0]} MeV and {values[1]} MeV.\")\n        break\n```\n<<<D>>>"
