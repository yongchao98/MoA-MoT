    "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly caused by the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or by axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   This is a biphenyl compound with bulky substituents (nitro group -NO2 and ester group -COOCH3) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   The steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted and the substitution pattern on each ring makes the molecule asymmetric (lacking a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion), the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, it exhibits axial chirality and is optically active.\n\n2.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center.\n    *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze benzophenone:**\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (an oxygen atom and two identical phenyl groups). It is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n4.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with ester groups: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Additionally, it has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Molecules with a center of inversion are achiral and not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Therefore, the correct option is B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomerism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes each organic compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism and identifies the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Optical isomerism requires a molecule to be chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n\n    # Analysis of each compound\n    analysis = {\n        1: {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Exhibits axial chirality (atropisomerism) due to restricted rotation around the biphenyl single bond caused by bulky ortho substituents.
