    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as a base.\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, bulky base t-BuOK will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group) and has one alpha-hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate must form at the C6 position.\n    *   This enolate will then act as a nucleophile and attack the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor).\n    *   The new bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the beta-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The resulting product, A, will be named based on this structure. The IUPAC name is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH as a base.\n    *   This is also a Michael addition reaction. The hydrogens on the carbon alpha to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane are acidic.\n    *   The base KOH will deprotonate the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n    *   This carbanion will act as a nucleophile and attack the beta-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the alpha-carbon of the nitropropane and the beta-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   To name the product B, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN). The chain is 6 carbons long (hexanenitrile).\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon as C1, we find a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name for product B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\n3.  **Compare and select the correct option:**\n    *   Product A: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n    *   Product B: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n    *   This combination matches option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two organic chemistry reactions and determines the major products,\n    then selects the correct option from a list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis of Reaction 1\n    # Reactants: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate\n    # Reagent: t-BuOK (Potassium tert-butoxide)\n    # Reaction Type: Michael Addition\n    # Step 1: Enolate Formation.
