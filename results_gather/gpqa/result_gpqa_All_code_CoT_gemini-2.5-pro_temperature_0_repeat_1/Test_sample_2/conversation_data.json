    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Represent the Quantum State:** The state of the particle is given by `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`. In the standard basis where `|↑⟩` is `[1, 0]` and `|↓⟩` is `[0, 1]`, the state vector `|ψ⟩` can be represented as a column vector `[0.5, √3/2]`.\n\n2.  **Represent the Operators:** The Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` in this basis are:\n    *   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    *   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    The operator in question is `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`. We will construct this operator matrix by performing the matrix arithmetic.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:** The expectation value of an operator `O` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n    *   `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since our state vector has real components, it is simply the transpose, a row vector `[0.5, √3/2]`.\n    *   The calculation involves matrix multiplication: `⟨ψ| * O * |ψ⟩`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will use the `numpy` library to handle the vectors and matrices.\n    *   Define the state vector `psi`.\n    *   Define the Pauli matrices `sigma_z` and `sigma_x`.\n    *   Calculate the operator `O`.\n    *   Perform the matrix multiplication `psi.conj().T @ O @ psi` to get the expectation value.\n    *   Round the final result to one decimal place and print it.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the quantum state vector |ψ⟩\n# |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩\n# In the z-basis, |↑⟩ = [1, 0] and |↓⟩ = [0, 1]\n# So, |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]\npsi = np.array([0.5, np.sqrt(3)/2])\n\n# Step 2: Define the Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n\n# Step 3: Construct the operator O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\noperator_O = 10 * sigma_z + 5 * sigma_x\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩\n# This is calculated as a matrix product: (ψ†) * O * ψ\n# where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.\n# In numpy, this can be done with the @ operator for matrix multiplication.\n# psi.conj().T gives the bra vector ⟨ψ|\nexpectation_value = psi.conj().T @ operator_O @ psi\n\n# Round the result to one decimal place\nrounded_expectation_value = round(expectation_value, 1)\n\n# Print the result and the options\nprint(\"The state vector |ψ⟩ is:\", psi)\nprint(\"The operator O is:\\n\", operator_O)\nprint(f\"The expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ is: {expectation_value}\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value rounded to one decimal place is: {rounded_expectation_value}\")\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 1.65\")\nprint(\"B) -1.4\")\nprint(\"C) -0.7\")\nprint(\"D) 0.85\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches choice C.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
