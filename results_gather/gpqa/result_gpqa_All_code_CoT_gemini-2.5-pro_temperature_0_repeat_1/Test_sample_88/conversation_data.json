    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and identify Product 1.**\n\n*   The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   It is heated with KOH at 240°C to form Product 1. The IR spectrum of Product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone (C=O).\n*   Product 1 is reduced with aluminum isopropoxide (a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction) to form Product 2. This reaction specifically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n*   The ozonolysis step is crucial. It tells us that Product 2, and therefore Product 1, must contain a C=C double bond.\n*   A molecule with an adamantane skeleton (3 rings), a ketone (1 C=O), and a double bond (1 C=C) would have a degree of unsaturation of 5. The formula would be C₁₀H₁₂O. This contradicts the provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1, which integrates to 14 hydrogens (implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O and no C=C bond).\n*   This contradiction implies that the provided NMR data for Product 1 is likely erroneous, and we must rely on the chemical reactions. The formation of a C₁₀H₁₂O product from C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ involves a skeletal rearrangement. A known, though complex, reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under basic conditions is rearrangement to **protoadamant-4-en-2-one** (systematic name: tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-en-2-one). Let's assume this is Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   Product 1 (protoadamant-4-en-2-one) is reduced to Product 2. The ketone at position C2 is reduced to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 2 is protoadamant-4-en-2-ol.** The C=C bond between C4 and C5 remains unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, which cleaves the C4=C5 double bond. This reaction opens one of the rings in the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic product.\n*   The cleavage of the C4=C5 double bond creates two aldehyde groups (-CHO), one at the original C4 position and one at the original C5 position.\n*   **Product 3 is a bicyclic molecule containing a secondary alcohol group and two aldehyde groups.**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the most deshielded proton in Product 3 and its coupling pattern.**\n\n*   The most deshielded protons in a molecule (excluding exchangeable protons like -OH) are typically aldehyde protons (-CHO), which resonate at δ 9-10 ppm. The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol (H-C-OH) is less deshielded (δ ~4 ppm).\n*   Therefore, we need to determine the coupling patterns of the two aldehyde protons in Product 3. The coupling of an aldehyde proton is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent (alpha) carbon.\n*   Let's analyze the local environment of the two new aldehyde groups in Product 3, based on the structure of the precursor, protoadamantane.\n    1.  **Aldehyde at C4:** In the protoadamantane skeleton, C4 is bonded to C3. C3 is a bridgehead carbon and is a methine group (CH). Therefore, the aldehyde proton at C4 is coupled to one proton on C3. According to the n+1 rule, its signal will be a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Aldehyde at C5:** In the protoadamantane skeleton, C5 is bonded to C6. C6 is a methylene group (CH₂). Therefore, the aldehyde proton at C5 is coupled to the two equivalent protons on C6. According to the n+1 rule, its signal will be a **triplet**.\n*   So, the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3 will show two aldehyde signals: a doublet and a triplet. The question asks for the coupling pattern of \"the\" most deshielded proton. Since both aldehyde protons are the most deshielded type, and \"triplet\" is one of the options while \"doublet\" is not, we select triplet.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. The reaction sequence involves a rearrangement of 1,3-dibromoadamantane to an unsaturated ketone (Product 1),\n#    followed by reduction to an unsaturated alcohol (Product 2), and finally ozonolysis to a dialdehyde-alcohol (Product 3).\n# 2. The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in Product 3 are the aldehyde protons.\n# 3. Based on the most plausible rearranged structure (protoadamantenone), the ozonolysis creates two different aldehyde groups.\n# 4. One aldehyde group is adjacent to a CH group, leading to a doublet for its proton.\n# 5. The other aldehyde group is adjacent to a CH2 group, leading to a triplet for its proton.\n# 6. The available options are A) doublet of triplets, B) triplet of triplets, C) pentet, D) triplet.\n# 7. Since \"triplet\" is a possible pattern for one of the most deshielded protons and it is listed as an option, this is the correct choice.\n\n# The choices are:\n# A) doublet of triplets\n# B) triplet of triplets\n# C) pentet\n# D) triplet\n\n# The analysis shows that one of the most deshielded protons (an aldehyde proton) will appear as a triplet.\n# Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.\n\nfinal_choice = 'D'\nprint(f\"The analysis leads to two possible coupling patterns for the most deshielded protons (aldehydes): a doublet and a triplet.\")\nprint(f\"Of the given options, only 'triplet' matches one of the expected patterns.\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is {final_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
