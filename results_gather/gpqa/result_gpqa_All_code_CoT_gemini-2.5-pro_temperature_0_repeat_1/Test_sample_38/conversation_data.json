    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics Principle:** In quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a certain region of space is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region. The wave function `ψ(x)` is a complex function.\n2.  **Calculate the Probability Density `|ψ(x)|²`:**\n    *   The wave function is given as `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i`.\n    *   This is a complex number of the form `Real + i * Imaginary`, where `Real = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and `Imaginary = -0.5`.\n    *   The magnitude squared, `|ψ(x)|²`, is calculated as `Real² + Imaginary²`.\n    *   So, `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`.\n3.  **Apply the Normalization Condition:** The problem states that the particles are *only* found between x=1 and x=3. This means the total probability of finding a particle in this range must be 1. This is known as the normalization condition. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    ∫₁³ `|ψ(x)|²` dx = 1\n4.  **Set up and Solve the Integral:**\n    *   We need to solve the integral: ∫₁³ (`a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`) dx = 1.\n    *   We can split the integral: `a²` ∫₁³ (`1 / (1 + x)`) dx + ∫₁³ `0.25` dx = 1.\n    *   The integral of `1 / (1 + x)` is `ln(1 + x)`. Evaluated from 1 to 3, this is `ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2)`.\n    *   The integral of `0.25` is `0.25x`. Evaluated from 1 to 3, this is `0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5`.\n5.  **Solve for 'a':**\n    *   Substituting the results back into the equation, we get: `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`.\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `a`:\n        *   `a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5`\n        *   `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n        *   `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n6.  **Write Python Code:** I will write a Python script to calculate the numerical value of `a` using the `math` library and then print the result along with the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The normalization condition leads to the equation: a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n# We need to solve for 'a'.\n# a^2 * ln(2) = 0.5\n# a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n# Calculate the value of a\nln_2 = math.log(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / ln_2\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(\"The calculated numerical value of 'a' is:\", a)\nprint(\"\\nHere are the choices:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.35\")\nprint(\"B) 0.6\")\nprint(\"C) 1.1\")\nprint(\"D) 0.85\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to choice D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
