    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Limiting Magnitude:** First, we need to find the faintest apparent V magnitude (m_V) that ESPRESSO can observe to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in one hour. According to the official ESPRESSO performance table (from the provided link), an S/N of 10 is achieved for a star with an apparent V magnitude of 16. Therefore, any star with `m_V <= 16` is considered detectable in terms of brightness.\n\n2.  **Check for Observability from Paranal:** ESPRESSO is located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude approx. -24.6°). This means it cannot observe stars that are too far north. A star is generally considered observable if its declination (`dec`) is less than `90° - |latitude|`. For Paranal, this means `dec <= 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°`. We must check if each star meets this condition.\n\n3.  **Calculate Apparent Magnitude for Each Star:**\n    *   For Canopus and Polaris, we will use their known apparent magnitudes and declinations.\n    *   For stars c, d, e, and f, we are given the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) in parsecs. We will calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n\n4.  **Count Detectable Stars:** We will go through each star and check if it meets both criteria:\n    *   Is it observable from Paranal's latitude?\n    *   Is its apparent magnitude less than or equal to the limiting magnitude of 16?\n\n5.  **Final Tally:** We will count the total number of stars that satisfy both conditions to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define constants based on the problem description and ESPRESSO documentation.\n    # Limiting apparent V magnitude for S/N=10 in 1hr with ESPRESSO 1-UT mode.\n    LIMITING_MAGNITUDE = 16.0\n    # Latitude of Paranal Observatory.\n    PARANAL_LATITUDE = -24.6  # degrees\n\n    # Step 2: Define the list of stars to be analyzed.\n    # Data includes name, type of magnitude given, value, distance (if applicable), and declination.\n    stars = {\n        \"a) Canopus\": {\"type\": \"apparent\", \"m_V\": -0.74, \"dec\": -52.7},\n        \"b) Polaris\": {\"type\": \"apparent\", \"m_V\": 1.98, \"dec\": 89.26},\n        \"c) Star (10 pc)\": {\"type\": \"absolute\", \"M_V\": 15.0, \"d_pc\": 10, \"dec\": 0.0},\n        \"d) Star (200 pc)\": {\"type\": \"absolute\", \"M_V\": 15.0, \"d_pc\": 200, \"dec\": 0.0},\n        \"e) Star (5 pc)\": {\"type\": \"absolute\", \"M_V\": 15.0, \"d_pc\": 5, \"dec\": 0.0},\n        \"f) Star (50 pc)\": {\"type\": \"absolute\", \"M_V\": 15.0, \"d_pc\": 50, \"dec\": 0.0},\n    }\n\n    detectable_count = 0\n    detectable_stars_list = []\n\n    # Maximum declination observable from Paranal\n    max_observable_dec = 90 - abs(PARANAL_LATITUDE)\n\n    print(f\"Starting analysis for ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory.\")\n    print(f\"Observability requires Declination <= {max_observable_dec:.1f} degrees.\")\n    print(f\"Detectability requires Apparent Magnitude <= {LIMITING_MAGNITUDE}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through each star, calculate its properties, and check detectability.\n    for name, data in stars.items():\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing {name} ---\")\n        \n        # Check 1: Is the star observable from Paranal?\n        is_observable = data[\"dec\"] <= max_observable_dec\n        print(f\"Declination: {data['dec']} deg.
