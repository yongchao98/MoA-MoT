    "My plan is to evaluate each statement about the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 to determine its accuracy based on established scientific knowledge.\n\n1.  **Analyze Statement A:** This statement describes the function of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. The complex does indeed function as a heterodimer and is involved in a proofreading/mismatch repair mechanism. Nsp14's ExoN domain, activated by nsp10, possesses 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity. This means it *degrades* or *breaks down* RNA strands to remove mismatched nucleotides. It is also known to degrade dsRNA to help the virus evade the host's innate immune response. The statement claims the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA, which is the direct opposite of its known enzymatic function. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement B:** This statement describes programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting, a key process in coronavirus gene expression. It correctly identifies the components (slippery sequence, pseudoknot), the mechanism (ribosome slipping back by 1 nucleotide), the outcome (producing two different polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab), and the high similarity between the frameshifting signals of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This is a well-documented and accurate description. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n3.  **Analyze Statement C:** This statement makes two claims about the frameshifting pseudoknot. First, it claims a linear correlation between the frameshifting rate and the number of conformations. This is a strong claim and an oversimplification; the relationship is more complex, involving the stability and unfolding kinetics of the conformations. Second, it claims that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 signals show two conformations under tension. While some early studies suggested a two-state model, more recent and detailed research has revealed a more complex three-state unfolding pathway for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot. Thus, this statement contains inaccuracies.\n\n4.  **Analyze Statement D:** This statement discusses the role of the ORF3a protein in inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death). It correctly identifies caspase-8 activation as a hallmark of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and the Bcl-2 protein family as central to the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Studies have shown that ORF3a does indeed activate caspase-8 without significantly affecting Bcl-2 levels, leading to the conclusion that it triggers apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth statements A and C contain inaccuracies. However, the error in statement A is a fundamental contradiction of the enzyme's primary function. An exonuclease, by definition, breaks down nucleic acids; stating that it *prevents* breakdown is a direct functional opposition. The inaccuracies in statement C relate to the finer details of a complex biophysical model that has been refined over time. The error in statement A is more definitive and fundamental. Therefore, statement A is the incorrect statement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mcq():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided statements about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology and identifies the incorrect one.\n\n    A) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism.
