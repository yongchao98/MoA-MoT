    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions is governed by the electric dipole selection rules. These rules dictate how the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m* can change during a transition.\n\n### 1. Dipole Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay (emission of a photon). The question specifies a two-step transition, implying the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: Since the initial orbital quantum number *l* is 0, the only possible change is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial magnetic quantum number *m* is 0. The selection rule allows $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: The transition must be to a lower energy level, so $n' < 3$. A decay to the $n'=2$ level is a common pathway.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m''=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. Since the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible changes are $\\Delta m \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, all of which are allowed.\n\nAll three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Transition Probabilities\n\nThe probability of a specific decay path depends on the transition rates, which are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that the angular part of the transition probability is determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):** The transition rates are found to be equal for all three possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **For the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Similarly, the transition rates from each of the three intermediate states to the final ground state are also equal.\n\nSince the probabilities for each of the three possible cascade routes are equal, and they are the only routes for this two-dipole transition process via the n=2 shell, the total probability is distributed evenly among them. Therefore, the probability of any single specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nOption A correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
