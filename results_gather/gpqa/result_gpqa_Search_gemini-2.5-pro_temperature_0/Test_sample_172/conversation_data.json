    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the energy-momentum relation.\n\n### Step 1: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). The principle is stated as:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δx** is the uncertainty in position.\n*   **Δp** is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n### Step 2: Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is a function of its momentum (p). For a free particle, the relativistic energy is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where 'c' is the speed of light and 'm' is the rest mass of the particle.\n\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the following relation, which holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases:\n\nΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp\n\nBy differentiating the energy-momentum equation, it can be shown that dE/dp = v, where 'v' is the velocity of the particle. Therefore:\n\nΔE = v * Δp\n\n### Step 3: Calculation\n\nNow, we can combine the equations from Step 1 and Step 2 and substitute the given values.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Velocity of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nFirst, calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNext, calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):\n\nΔE = v * Δp\nΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE = 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is of the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
