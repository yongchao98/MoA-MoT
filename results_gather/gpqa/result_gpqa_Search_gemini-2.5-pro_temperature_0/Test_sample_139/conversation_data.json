    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the information provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). Given the clue about a heavier isotope, B is identified as **heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released in a reaction and its molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider the reaction that produces B (D₂O). Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The violent reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. If the final products involve deuterium, it is highly likely that the reactants do as well. A plausible candidate for gas W is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, the deuterated substance X must react with a deuterium source. This makes liquid Y **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is consistent with the identification of substance B.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** Substance X contains a heavy isotope, is a reagent in organic chemistry, and reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. A prime candidate for X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which matches our earlier deduction.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Heating G:** When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and by extension, deuteroxide) decomposes to form aluminum oxide and water (or in this case, D₂O, which is substance B).\n    *   **Organic Reagent:** LiAlD₄ and its common analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), are powerful and widely used reducing agents in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Reaction with Keto Acid:** A keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) when reduced by a strong agent like LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) yields a diol (containing 2 oxygen atoms), which matches the description.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers for this calculation, as the options are integers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) is 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum (Al) is 27.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Total Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
