    "The search results confirm that the total energy of a relativistic harmonic oscillator is conserved. A YouTube video and a paper on arXiv walk through the derivation of the total energy, which is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy (including rest energy) and the potential energy.\n\nThe total energy `E` is given by:\n`E = γmc² + U(x)`\nwhere `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, `m` is the rest mass, `c` is the speed of light, `v` is the velocity, and `U(x)` is the potential energy. For a harmonic oscillator, `U(x) = (1/2)kx²`, where `k` is the spring constant and `x` is the displacement from equilibrium.\n\nThe principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy of the system remains constant throughout the oscillation. We can equate the total energy at the point of maximum displacement (amplitude `A`) with the total energy at the equilibrium position (`x=0`).\n\n1.  **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    *   The velocity `v` is 0.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is 1.\n    *   The potential energy is maximum: `U(A) = (1/2)kA²`.\n    *   The total energy is `E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²`.\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    *   The velocity is maximum, `v = v_max`.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: `U(0) = 0`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)`.\n    *   The total energy is `E_total = γ_max * mc²`.\n\nBy equating the total energy at these two points:\n`mc² + (1/2)kA² = γ_max * mc²`\n\nNow, we solve for `v_max`:\n\nFirst, solve for `γ_max`:\n`γ_max = (mc² + (1/2)kA²) / mc²`\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNext, substitute the definition of `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)`\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate `v_max`:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))`\n\nSquare both sides:\n`1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nSolve for `v_max²/c²`:\n`v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²`\n\nFinally, solve for `v_max`:\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²)`\n\nThis derived expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
