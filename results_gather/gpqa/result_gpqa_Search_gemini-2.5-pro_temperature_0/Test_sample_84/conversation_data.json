    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step calculation based on the provided data and fundamental principles of astrophysics.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its orbital distance. The formula for equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis of its orbit (a), represented as T_eq ∝ 1/√a. All other factors, such as the star's temperature and radius, and the planets' albedos (which are stated to be the same), cancel out when taking the ratio.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThe semi-major axis (a) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV method measures the \"wobble\" of a star caused by an orbiting planet's gravitational pull. This wobble induces a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where 'c' is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and the semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n3.  **Derive the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** By rearranging the formula, we find that the semi-major axis is proportional to the square of the planet's mass divided by the square of the radial velocity amplitude:\n    a ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n    From this, we can establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n4.  **Substitute Doppler Shift for Radial Velocity:** Since K is proportional to Δλ, the ratio K₁/K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n5.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:** Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p₁) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p₂) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
