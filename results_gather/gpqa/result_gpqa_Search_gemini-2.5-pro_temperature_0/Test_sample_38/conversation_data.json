    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. The probability of finding the particle at a specific position x is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe squared magnitude of this complex wave function is calculated as:\n|ψ(x)|² = (Real part)² + (Imaginary part)²\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nTo find \"a\", we must solve this definite integral:\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x\n\nNext, we evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of integration (from 1 to 3):\n[a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), this simplifies to:\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nNow, we set the result equal to 1, according to the normalization condition:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, we can calculate \"a\":\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ √0.7214\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
