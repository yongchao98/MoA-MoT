    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\nThe structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbons (C): There are 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): There are 22 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** Each hydrogen is bonded to a carbon, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two carbon-carbon double bonds ((CH3)2**C=C**H- and -CH**=C**(CH3)2).\n    *   **C-C bonds:** There are 9 carbon-carbon single bonds.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We use the provided bond energies:\n*   ΔH_atomization = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n*   ΔH_atomization = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n*   ΔH_atomization = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n*   ΔH_atomization = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms**\n\nThis is the energy needed to convert the elements in their standard state (solid carbon and gaseous H2) into individual gaseous atoms.\nThe overall reaction for atomization of the elements is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\n*   **For Carbon:** Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** Energy = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\n*   Total enthalpy of formation for gaseous atoms (ΔH_f_atoms) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form the gaseous atoms from their elements and the energy released when these atoms form the compound.\n*   ΔH_f = ΔH_f_atoms - ΔH_atomization(compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n*   ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**5. Convert to the Correct Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. We must check the units of the given options. Options B and C are in kJ/g. To convert our answer, we need the molar mass of the compound (C12H22).\n\n*   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, we convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.44 kJ/g\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nThe calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
