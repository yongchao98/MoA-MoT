    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of about 32% relative to the M+ peak. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these two features strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### **3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). Its integration as 1H confirms the presence of one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the two protons closer to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure has an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would be more complex and would not show the characteristic para-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule's structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   **Formula (C₇H₅ClO₂):** The molecular weight is 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It has a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the two doublets seen in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The chemical shifts are also consistent with literature values for 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would lead to a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid, so it would not show the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum or the acidic proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
