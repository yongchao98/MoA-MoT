    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition. This means both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. Since the starting material is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The *anti*-opening of the racemic epoxide mixture results in a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is because the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives the (4R,5S)-diol, and the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives the (4S,5R)-diol. These two are the same meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a cis-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso epoxide can occur by nucleophilic attack at either of the two equivalent carbons of the epoxide.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Attack at one carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, while attack at the other carbon produces its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Therefore, this reaction yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric diols.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The racemic pair will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso compound from the other isomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase will also resolve the racemic mixture, separating the (4R,5R)-enantiomer from the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
