    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an analysis of the provided options:\n\n### Analysis of Observations\n\n1.  **1H NMR Spectrum:** The crude compound shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). This indicates the presence of two very similar, yet magnetically non-equivalent, environments for that specific proton. The fact that they are present in roughly equal amounts is also a key clue.\n2.  **LC-MS Analysis:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both of these peaks correspond to compounds with the same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected final peptide.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by standard 1H NMR or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column. To separate or distinguish enantiomers, a chiral environment is required, such as a chiral NMR solvent or a chiral chromatography column, which was not specified in the problem. This option is inconsistent with the observations.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and, therefore, a different mass. The LC-MS data clearly shows that both separated peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product. This option is contradicted by the mass spectrometry results.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This situation arises when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them. Unlike enantiomers, diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in two diastereomers would have different chemical shifts, explaining the two observed peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Due to their different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography techniques like HPLC. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **In Peptide Synthesis:** This is a common problem in peptide synthesis where racemization (the conversion of an enantiomerically pure starting material into a mixture of enantiomers) can occur at an amino acid's alpha-carbon during the coupling reaction. If one of the chiral amino acids in the peptide chain racemizes, the final product will be a nearly 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers. This perfectly explains the two peaks of equal intensity in both the NMR and LC-MS.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This refers to a side reaction where, for example, an extra amino acid is added. Such a product would have a significantly different molecular weight from the target molecule. This is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the expected product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe presence of two separable species with the same mass, which are also distinguishable by NMR, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a well-known potential side reaction in peptide synthesis due to racemization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
