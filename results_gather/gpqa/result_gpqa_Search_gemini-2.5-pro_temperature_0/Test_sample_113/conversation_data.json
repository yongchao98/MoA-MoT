    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophile, a cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. For the reaction to yield the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent A must therefore be a proton source. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, provides the necessary proton (H⁺) to form the hydroxyl group (-OH). While the reaction can be performed by generating HCN *in situ* with a weak acid, a direct acid source like H₃O⁺ (from a strong acid like HCl) is a standard and effective method for the protonation step.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. When catalyzed by acid, the nitrile is typically heated with a strong mineral acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid in an aqueous solution. The strong acid protonates the nitrile, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, and drives the hydrolysis to completion to form the carboxylic acid. While a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is far less effective, and the reaction would be very slow and likely incomplete. Therefore, a strong acid like HCl is the appropriate reagent for B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   For the first reaction, **A = H₃O⁺** is the correct choice to provide the proton for the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   For the second reaction, **B = HCl** is the suitable strong acid catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
