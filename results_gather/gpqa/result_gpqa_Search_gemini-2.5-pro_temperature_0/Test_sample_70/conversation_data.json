    "The search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The planetary equilibrium temperature is the theoretical temperature a planet would have if it were a black body heated only by its star. The formula is given as T_eq = [ (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * r²) ]^(1/4) * T_star, where 'A' is the albedo, 'R_star' is the star's radius, 'T_star' is the star's temperature, and 'r' is the planet's distance from the star. For planets around the same star, with the same albedo, the formula simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(r). My initial derivation was correct.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same central body, the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (r, or 'a'). This is expressed as T² ∝ r³. This confirms that r ∝ T^(2/3).\n*   **Combined Relationship:** Combining these two principles, T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(T^(2/3)), which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/T^(1/3). Therefore, the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3). This confirms my entire derivation.\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods (P) as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n\nI need the ratio of periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4.\n*   P₂ corresponds to the value 2 in the ratio.\n*   P₄ corresponds to the value 3.5 in the ratio.\n\nSo, the ratio P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow, I calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.571428)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root:\n0.8³ = 0.512\n0.85³ = 0.614125\n0.83³ = 0.571787\n\nThe value 0.83 is extremely close.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. This matches option B. The other information in the prompt (TTV discovery method, circular orbits, orbital resonance) serves to confirm that the system is physically plausible and follows standard orbital mechanics, but is not directly needed for the calculation itself.\n\nFinal check of the question and my steps.\n- Ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n- Albedo is the same, planets orbit the same star.\n- T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a)\n- Kepler's Third Law: P² ∝ a³ => a ∝ P^(2/3)\n- Substitute 'a' in the temperature relation: T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(P^(2/3)) = 1/P^(1/3)\n- T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1/P_4^(1/3)) / (1/P_2^(1/3)) = (P_2/P_4)^(1/3)\n- P_2/P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n- Ratio = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83\n\nThe calculation is correct. The answer is B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the equilibrium temperature of a planet to its orbital period.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star and its distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from the star. For planets orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n    The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, which is a necessary condition for this simplified relationship.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis ('a'). For planets in the same system, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   This can be rearranged to show the relationship for the semi-major axis: a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combining the Relationships:** We can substitute the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Using the Given Values:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The period for Planet_2 (P₂) is 2 (in ratio units).\n    *   The period for Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5 (in ratio units).\n    *   The ratio P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.5714\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
