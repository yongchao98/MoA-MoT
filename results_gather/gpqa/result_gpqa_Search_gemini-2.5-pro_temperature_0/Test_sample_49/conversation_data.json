    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression for its amplitude by examining the factors of `1/(4π)`. In quantum field theory calculations using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression.\n\nThe scribbled note contains the term `1/(4π)^6`. To find the number of loops, which we can call 'L', we can set up the following equation:\n\n`(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^6`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for L gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression relate to different aspects of the diagram. For instance, `alpha^3` and `g^2` are coupling constants that indicate the number and type of vertices in the diagram. The remaining parts, `sqrt(2)`, `8`, and `(Q/M)^2`, are numerical factors and kinematic ratios that depend on the specific particles and momenta involved. However, the power of the `1/(4π)` term is the most direct indicator of the number of loops.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram had 3 loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
