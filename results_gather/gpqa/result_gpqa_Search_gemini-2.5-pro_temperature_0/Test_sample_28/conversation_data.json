    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis. The goal is to find the mutation that most probably results in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a \"knockout\" mutation that stops the protein from being made correctly.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the intact gene's initial sequence to understand its translation into amino acids. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon that codes for the amino acid Methionine and signals the beginning of protein translation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (along with TGA and TAG). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery of the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. This results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant has two changes compared to the intact gene. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this might affect protein function, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant also has two **missense mutations**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Again, this is less likely to completely eliminate the protein's function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This nonsense mutation will halt protein synthesis, leading to a very short and non-functional protein product. This is the most direct and probable way to eliminate the function of the protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only cause amino acid substitutions (missense mutations), which may or may not inactivate the protein. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most desirable outcome for the stated goal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
