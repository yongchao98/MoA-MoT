    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the correct final products.\n\n### Reaction A: Dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate is deprotonated by sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) at the acidic α-carbon to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The nucleophile will attack the electrophilic β-carbon.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent yields the final product.\n4.  **Product (A):** The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`. The IUPAC name for this compound is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone. Enamines are excellent carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon position of the parent ketone. This type of reaction is known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n3.  **Reaction:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) first protonates the intermediate and then hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone.\n4.  **Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with the alkyl group from the nitrile. The resulting structure is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Retrosynthesis:** This is a reverse problem where we need to identify the starting material C.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone) is a classic Michael acceptor. In the product, it has become the `-(CH₂) - (CH₂) - CO-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group.\n3.  **Michael Donor (C):** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The new bond is between the C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of the methyl vinyl ketone. This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of reactant C, formed by deprotonation with KOH. The most acidic proton in C is at the C2 position, between the two carbonyl groups.\n4.  **Reactant (C):** Therefore, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
