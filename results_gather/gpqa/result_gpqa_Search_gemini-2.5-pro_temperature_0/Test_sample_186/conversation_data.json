    "### Summary of Star Properties and Observability\n\nTo determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, each star's visibility from the Paranal Observatory and its apparent magnitude must be assessed against the instrument's capabilities. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a one-hour exposure.\n\n**Observatory Location and ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude:**\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude restricts the visibility of stars in the far northern sky. A common rule for observability is that a star's declination should be greater than the observatory's latitude minus 90 degrees. For Paranal, this means stars with a declination above roughly +65 degrees are difficult or impossible to observe.\n\nESPRESSO, when coupled with one 8.2m VLT Unit Telescope (UT), can achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. For faint objects, different binning modes can be used to increase the S/N. In the High Resolution (HR) mode with 4x2 binning (HR42), the limiting magnitude is approximately V ~ 18 mag. This is the magnitude at which the instrument transitions from being limited by photon noise to being limited by detector read-out-noise. Another source indicates that in a single 1-hour exposure, a S/N of 10 can be reached for a V = 19 magnitude target. For this analysis, a conservative limiting magnitude of V = 18 will be used.\n\n---\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** -0.74.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Approximately -52° 42'.\n*   **Observability:** With a declination of -52° 42', Canopus is easily observable from Paranal in the southern hemisphere.\n*   **Detectability:** Its apparent magnitude of -0.74 is significantly brighter than ESPRESSO's limiting magnitude of V ≈ 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Approximately +1.98.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** Approximately +89° 16'.\n*   **Observability:** Polaris has a declination of nearly +90 degrees. From Paranal's latitude of -24.6 degrees, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and therefore cannot be observed.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag, and 10 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Using the distance modulus formula, m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10), the apparent magnitude is 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0 degrees.\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0 degrees places the star on the celestial equator, making it perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of V ≈ 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag, and 200 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0 degrees.\n*   **Observability:** Observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude of V ≈ 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag, and 5 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0 degrees.\n*   **Observability:** Observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of V ≈ 18.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag, and 50 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5.\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 0 degrees.\n*   **Observability:** Observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 18.5 is slightly fainter than or right at the conservative limiting magnitude of V ≈ 18, but brighter than the V=19 limit for S/N=10 in one hour mentioned in other documentation. Given this, it is likely detectable.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n---\n### Final Count:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following stars are detectable:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) with m_V = 15\n3.  Star (e) with m_V = 13.5\n4.  Star (f) with m_V = 18.5\n\nIn total, 4 of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n\n<<<D>>>"
