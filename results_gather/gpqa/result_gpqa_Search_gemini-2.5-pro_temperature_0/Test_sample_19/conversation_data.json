    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations posits that a nucleon within a nucleus responds to an interaction as if it were a free particle. This approximation is valid under a specific set of assumptions that simplify the complex environment inside the nucleus. Analyzing the given options, we can determine the correct set of assumptions.\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the fundamental concept of the impulse approximation, often referred to as the \"one-body current\" assumption. It assumes that the incoming probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon at a time, and the total interaction with the nucleus is the incoherent sum of these individual interactions. The other nucleons are treated as spectators to the primary interaction.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This statement describes the absence of \"final state interactions\" (FSI). It assumes that after the probe interacts with the chosen nucleon, this nucleon exits the nucleus without any further scattering or interaction with the remaining (A-1) nucleons. This is a key feature of the most straightforward version of this model, known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption is not a standard requirement for the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation treats nucleons as the fundamental entities of interaction, not their constituent quarks. While the internal structure of the nucleon is accounted for through form factors, the relativistic nature of the quarks within it is a separate area of physics and not a precondition for applying the impulse approximation at the nucleon level.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is a crucial condition for the impulse approximation. It assumes that the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so brief that the forces binding the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus can be considered negligible during the collision. This allows the nucleon to be treated as \"quasi-free.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are that the interaction involves only one nucleon (1), that this nucleon does not interact with the rest of the nucleus after being struck (2), and that the nuclear binding forces are negligible during the interaction (4).\n\n<<<D>>>"
