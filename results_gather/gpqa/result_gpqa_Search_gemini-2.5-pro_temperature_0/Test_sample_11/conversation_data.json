    "My initial calculation is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Calculation Steps:** The problem involves a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The key principles are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (π⁺) is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the final products, the muon (μ⁺) and the muon neutrino (ν), must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's call the magnitude of this momentum 'p'.\n    2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    3.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where m₀ is the rest mass.\n        *   For the muon: E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n        *   For the neutrino, its rest mass is considered to be zero. Therefore, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, and E_ν = pc = KE_ν.\n\n*   **Solving for Kinetic Energies:**\n    1.  From energy conservation: m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    2.  We can write E_μ as m_πc² - E_ν.\n    3.  Using the relativistic energy formula for the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)².\n    4.  Substitute the expressions for E_μ and pc: (m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n    5.  Expanding and solving for E_ν (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy, KE_ν):\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n        KE_ν = E_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n    6.  Plugging in the given values:\n        KE_ν = [(139.6 MeV)² - (105.7 MeV)²] / [2 * 139.6 MeV]\n        KE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n        KE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    7.  Now, find the muon's kinetic energy (KE_μ) using energy conservation:\n        KE_μ = m_πc² - m_μc² - KE_ν\n        KE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n        KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. Search results confirm these values, with one source calculating the muon kinetic energy to be 4.12 MeV and the neutrino kinetic energy to be 29.65 MeV. Another source states the muon kinetic energy is 4.13 MeV. These minor differences are due to slightly different values used for the rest masses of the particles. The values match option B most closely.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the product particles are:\n*   Kinetic Energy of muon (μ⁺): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of neutrino (ν): **29.8 MeV**\n\n<<<B>>>"
