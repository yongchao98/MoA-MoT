    "The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation for the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has spin 1/2 and its magnetic moment `μ` is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate with respect to the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`. The magnetic moment is related to the spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The Hamiltonian `H` of the system is determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field:\n    `H = -μ · B = -γ(Sx*Bx + Sy*By + Sz*Bz)`\n    Since the new field is `B = Bĵ`, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n    `H = -γB * Sy`\n    where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle `|ψ(t)>` evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, the solution is:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t)`. To find this, we need to calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin oscillates as:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is therefore:\n    `<μz>(t) = γ * <Sz>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\nThe term `cos(γBt)` describes an oscillation. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `ω = γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. The expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis) at this frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
