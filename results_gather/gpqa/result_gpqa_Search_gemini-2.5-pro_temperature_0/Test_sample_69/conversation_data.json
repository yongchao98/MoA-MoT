    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Identify gases B and D, and solvent H:** The reaction D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio is a strong clue. A well-known reaction that fits this description is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas: CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l). Phosgene (COCl₂) is an extremely hazardous substance used as a solvent and reagent in industry. Therefore, we can identify:\n    *   **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas)\n    *   **D = CO** (Carbon monoxide)\n    *   **H = COCl₂** (Phosgene, also known as carbonyl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identify acids F and G:** The reaction of C with water reforms A and produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Since C is formed from a reaction involving chlorine (B), the strong acid F is almost certainly hydrochloric acid (HCl). The formation of two distinct acids from the hydrolysis of a substance made only from A and chlorine is unusual. However, if C is a complex where chlorine molecules are trapped and then released into water, the dissolved chlorine will hydrolyze: Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HClO (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid). This perfectly matches the description. Thus:\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = HClO** (Hypochlorous acid)\n\n3.  **Identify solid A and product C:** The hydrolysis reaction C + H₂O → A + HCl + HClO implies that A is a solid host material that traps chlorine gas to form C, and this host is reformed (unchanged) when the chlorine is released in water. The stoichiometry A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C suggests that one mole of A can trap eight moles of chlorine. A plausible candidate for A is Buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀), a solid which can form clathrates or charge-transfer complexes with guest molecules. The resulting complex, C, would be C₆₀·8Cl₂. While C₆₀ is black, its complexes can be colored, so it is plausible that C is \"bright red\".\n    *   **A = C₆₀** (Buckminsterfullerene)\n    *   **C = C₆₀·8Cl₂** (A fullerene-chlorine complex)\n\n4.  **Identify the extremely hazardous product E:** Product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D.\n    *   C(C₆₀·8Cl₂) + 2D(2CO) → E\n    The reaction involves the trapped chlorine in C reacting with carbon monoxide. The most direct reaction is the formation of phosgene: 2CO + 2Cl₂ → 2COCl₂. The overall reaction would be C₆₀·8Cl₂ + 2CO → C₆₀ + 6Cl₂ + 2COCl₂. The product E, described as \"extremely hazardous,\" is phosgene (COCl₂).\n    *   **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene)\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:** Now we must find the molecular symmetry group for phosgene (COCl₂). The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its structure is trigonal planar.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   It has two vertical mirror planes (σv). One is the plane containing all the atoms, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the **C₂v** point group. This is a common point group for molecules like water (H₂O) and formaldehyde (H₂CO).\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is C₂v.\n\n<<<A>>>"
