    "### Calculation of Maximum Orbital Period\n\nTo determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics and the geometry of transits.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1.  **Shared Orbital Plane:** Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their orbits have the same inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight.\n2.  **Impact Parameter:** The transit impact parameter (`b`) is the projected distance between the center of the star and the planet at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius. It is defined by the formula `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit and `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n3.  **Transit Condition:** For a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of its star. The limiting case for a standard transit is when the center of the planet passes exactly over the star's limb. This corresponds to a maximum impact parameter (`b_max`) of 1. For a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation (the planet passing behind the star) will also occur half an orbit later.\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (`P`) of a planet to its semi-major axis (`a`), stating that `P²` is proportional to `a³`.\n\n**Derivation:**\n\nFrom the impact parameter formula, we can establish a relationship between the two planets. Since `R_s` and `cos(i)` are the same for both, the ratio `a/b` is constant:\n\n`a₁ / b₁ = a₂ / b₂`\n\nThis can be rearranged to find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\n`a₂ / a₁ = b₂ / b₁`\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of their orbital periods is related to the ratio of their semi-major axes as follows:\n\n`(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁ )³`\n\nBy substituting the relationship of the semi-major axes and impact parameters, we get:\n\n`(P₂ / P₁)² = (b₂ / b₁ )³`\n\nSolving for the period of the second planet, `P₂`, gives:\n\n`P₂ = P₁ * (b₂ / b₁)^(3/2)`\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   `P₁` (Period of Planet 1) = 3 days\n*   `b₁` (Impact Parameter of Planet 1) = 0.2\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible period for Planet 2 (`P₂_max`), which will occur at its maximum possible impact parameter (`b₂_max`). The limiting condition for a transit is `b₂_max = 1`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n`P₂_max = 3 * (1 / 0.2)^(3/2)`\n`P₂_max = 3 * (5)^(1.5)`\n`P₂_max = 3 * 5 * √5`\n`P₂_max ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n`P₂_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThis result indicates that the maximum orbital period for the second planet to still transit its host star is approximately 33.5 days. The information regarding the radii of the star and the planets is not necessary for this calculation, as the relationship depends only on the initial planet's period and impact parameter and the geometric condition for a transit.\n\n<<<C>>>"
