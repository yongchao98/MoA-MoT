    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture based on the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This indicates that the two compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, and each compound has only one type of aromatic proton (all aromatic protons on a given molecule are chemically equivalent). The 1:1 ratio of the signals confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, as long as each compound has the same number of aromatic protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the combined methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture. All signals are singlets, meaning there is no splitting, which is characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to any protons.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Compound Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H (or 1:1:2).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" methyls (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" methyls (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups, not just methyl groups. The spectrum would show a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture must contain two compounds that each give a single peak in the aromatic region. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit this criterion. Since they each have 2 aromatic protons, a 1:1 mixture will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\nNow, we must find the combination whose alkyl signals add up to three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in up to five signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives a total of four signals, which only matches the data if there is an accidental overlap of signals. To get a 2:1:1 ratio (which corresponds to 12H:6H:6H), the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap, which is unlikely as they are in different chemical environments.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined alkyl signals:** The mixture will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
