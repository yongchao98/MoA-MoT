    "The initial analysis based on the relativistic velocity-addition formula is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **The Problem:** We need to find the speed of light (`u`) in a moving medium (glass) as seen by a stationary observer (in the laboratory).\n*   **Frame S (Laboratory):** The observer is at rest. The glass is moving with velocity `v`.\n*   **Frame S' (Glass):** The glass is at rest. The speed of light within the glass is `u'`.\n*   **Speed of light in the medium's rest frame (S'):** The index of refraction `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). Given `c=1`, we have `n = 1 / u'`, which means `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity-Addition Formula:** For collinear motion, the formula to find the velocity `u` in frame S, given the velocity `u'` in frame S' and the relative velocity `v` between the frames, is `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`. This formula is the correct one to use, as opposed to the simple classical addition of velocities. This specific application to light in a moving medium is a classic example known as the Fizeau experiment.\n*   **Applying the values:**\n    *   `u'` = 1/n\n    *   `v` = v\n    *   `c` = 1\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n*   **Simplifying the expression:** To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option C. The search results confirm that the relativistic velocity addition formula is the appropriate tool and that its application to light in a moving medium was famously demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment.\n\nFinal check of the steps and the result. The logic is sound and confirmed by multiple sources.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\nThis problem is a direct application of Einstein's velocity-addition formula, which describes how to combine velocities in the theory of special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Define the velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within* the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass (S'), is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). The problem states that `c=1`, so `n = c / u' = 1 / u'`. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We want to find the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula.**\n    For motion along a single axis, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    We have `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1`.\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option C. This problem is a classic example explained by special relativity and is related to the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\n<<<C>>>"
