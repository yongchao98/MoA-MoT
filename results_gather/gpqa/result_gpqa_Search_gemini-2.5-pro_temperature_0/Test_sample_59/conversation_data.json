    "To determine how long the journey to Earth will take for the 22-year-old astronaut, we need to calculate the effects of time dilation at relativistic speeds.\n\n### 1. Distance to Earth\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n### 2. Time of Travel in Earth's Frame of Reference\n\nThe spacecraft travels at a constant speed of 0.99999987 *c*. For an observer on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel 163,000 light-years is calculated as:\n\n*Time = Distance / Speed*\n*Time = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987*c* ≈ 163,000.2 years\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n### 3. Time Dilation and the Astronaut's Frame of Reference\n\nDue to the effects of time dilation, time will pass much slower for the astronaut traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n*Δt' = Δt / γ*\n\nWhere:\n*   Δt' is the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time).\n*   Δt is the time measured by the observer on Earth.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the given speed (v = 0.99999987*c*):\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow, we can calculate the time that passes for the astronaut:\n\n*Δt' = 163,000.2 years / 1961.16*\n*Δt' ≈ 83.1 years*\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe journey to Earth will take approximately 83.1 years from the astronaut's point of view. Since the astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 solar years, they have 128 years of life remaining (150 - 22). Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.\n\nThe calculated travel time of approximately 83 years is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
