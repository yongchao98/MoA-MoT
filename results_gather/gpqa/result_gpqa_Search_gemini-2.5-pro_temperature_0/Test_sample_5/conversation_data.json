    "The problem asks for the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass *m* in a two-dimensional potential given by:\n\nV(r, θ) = ½ kr² + ³⁄₂ kr² cos²(θ)\n\nTo solve this, it is advantageous to convert the potential from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between these coordinate systems are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ k(x²)\nV(x, y) = ½ kx² + ½ ky² + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = (½ + ³⁄₂)kx² + ½ ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + ½ ky²\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. This means the problem is separable.\n\nV(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y)\nwhere:\nVₓ(x) = 2kx²\nVᵧ(y) = ½ ky²\n\nThe total energy *E* of the system is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators: E = Eₓ + Eᵧ.\n\nThe standard form for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator potential is V(z) = ½ mω²z², and its energy eigenvalues are given by Eₙ = (n + ½)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\nVₓ(x) = 2kx² = ½ (4k)x²\nComparing this to V(z) = ½ mω²z², we can identify the effective spring constant for the x-motion as kₓ = 4k. The angular frequency ωₓ is then:\nmωₓ² = 4k  => ωₓ = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-oscillator are:\nEₙₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħωₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\nVᵧ(y) = ½ ky²\nThe spring constant is kᵧ = k. The angular frequency ωᵧ is:\nmωᵧ² = k => ωᵧ = √(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-oscillator are:\nEₙᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThe total energy spectrum is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + ³⁄₂)ħ√(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (2nₓ+3nᵧ+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3nₓ+2nᵧ+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2nₓ+nᵧ+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (nₓ+3*nᵧ+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe derived energy spectrum matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
