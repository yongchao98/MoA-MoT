    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, giving one signal at ~7 ppm. The two equivalent alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm) give two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **Diene:** The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons and a CH₂ group at the 5-position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic ring system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Products (Major and Minor):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the reaction, making it the kinetically favored product. The *exo* product is the minor product.\n    *   Let's visualize the structures using the standard numbering for a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is positioned *syn* (on the same side as) the C7-methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the two methine protons (H5, H6) from the maleic anhydride part point *towards* the C2=C3 double bond, which bears the four methyl groups.\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7-methylene bridge. Here, the H5 and H6 protons point *away* from the C2=C3 double bond.\n\n4.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n    *   Based on the structures determined above:\n        *   In the **endo (major) product**, the H5/H6 protons are close to the methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Therefore, a NOE cross-peak between them is expected.\n        *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the H5/H6 protons are far from these methyl groups. A NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. The key cross-peak connects the H5/H6 protons with the vinyl methyl protons.\n\n5.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **H5/H6 Protons:** These two methine protons are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. They are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing anhydride group. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** and an integral of **2H** is very reasonable. The option describes this as a \"2H singlet\".\n    *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups on the double bond. Due to symmetry, they are expected to appear as two distinct sets. Each set contains two methyl groups, leading to two signals, each with an integral of **6H**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate for methyl groups on a double bond in such a system. The option refers to \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\".\n    *   **Bridge Protons (C7-H₂):** These two protons are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct signals, probably doublets. The option \"a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\" likely corresponds to one of these bridge protons.\n    *   **Other Methyl Protons:** The other set of vinyl methyls is given as \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\".\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product connects the H5/H6 methine protons with one of the sets of vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Matching this with the provided options:\n        *   **\"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\"** corresponds to one set of vinyl methyl groups.\n        *   **\"A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\"** corresponds to the H5/H6 methine protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<C>>>"
