    "The initial calculation seems correct. I will refine it with a more precise value for the proton's rest mass energy and then finalize the answer.\n\n1.  **Initial State & Energy Conservation**: The process is a proton-antiproton annihilation. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the annihilation happens at rest. In this scenario, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. Some sources round this to 938 MeV or 939.3 MeV. I will use 938.27 MeV for better precision.\n    *   Total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = $E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State & Energy Distribution**: The annihilation produces four particles of mass $m_A$, where $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the final particles.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   Energy per particle A ($E_A$) = $E_{final} / 4 = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV} / 4 = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Calculation**: Each particle A has a total energy $E_A = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$ and a rest energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We can find its velocity using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n    *   $\\gamma = E_A / (m_A c^2) = 469.135 \\text{ MeV} / 300 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1.56378$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$\n        *   $1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / \\gamma^2$\n        *   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / \\gamma^2$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n    *   Plugging in the value for $\\gamma$:\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.56378)^2}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.44558}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.40890}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        *   $v \\approx 0.7688c$\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning.\n- The assumption of annihilation at rest is justified by the \"slowly moving\" antiproton.\n- Conservation of energy is correctly applied.\n- Equal energy distribution among the four identical product particles is justified by momentum conservation in the center-of-mass frame.\n- The relativistic energy formula is correctly used to find the velocity.\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\nThe problem describes a proton-antiproton annihilation at rest, producing four particles.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total initial energy.**\n    The process begins with a proton and a \"slowly moving\" antiproton. This implies we can consider them both to be effectively at rest, so their initial kinetic energy is negligible. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$) = $2 \\times (\\text{rest energy of a proton})$\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the energy of each final particle.**\n    The annihilation results in four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). By the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is distributed among these four particles. Since the initial momentum is zero, the energy is shared equally.\n    *   Energy per particle A ($E_A$) = $E_{initial} / 4$\n    *   $E_A = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV} / 4 = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the velocity of particle A.**\n    The total energy ($E_A$) of each particle A is the sum of its rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its kinetic energy. The relationship is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is $E_A / (m_A c^2) = 469.135 \\text{ MeV} / 300 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1.564$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is also defined as $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$. We can solve for the velocity $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$\n    *   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/\\gamma^2$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.564)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.446} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
