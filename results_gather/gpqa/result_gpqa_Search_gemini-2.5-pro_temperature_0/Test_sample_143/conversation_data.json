    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to perform a calculation based on the principles of special relativity and particle physics.\n\n### 1. Understand the Key Concepts:\n\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** This is a measure of the uncertainty in the energy of an unstable particle. It is inversely proportional to the particle's lifetime.\n*   **Mean Proper Lifetime (τ₀):** This is the average lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width by the formula τ₀ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to relativistic effects, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. This observed lifetime (τ_lab) is given by τ_lab = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (d):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It is calculated as d = v * τ_lab, where v is the particle's velocity.\n\n### 2. The Formula:\n\nCombining these concepts, the mean decay distance can be expressed as:\nd = v * γ * τ₀ = β * c * γ * (ħ / Γ)\nwhere:\n*   β = v/c (velocity as a fraction of the speed of light)\n*   c is the speed of light\n*   ħc is a useful physical constant, approximately 197.3 MeV·fm.\n*   The term βγ can also be expressed as p/m, where p is the momentum and m is the mass of the particle.\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps:\n\nFirst, we calculate the relativistic factor βγ using the given energy and mass.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Total energy E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n    *   Rest mass m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV (This is technically m_X*c²)\n    *   Decay width Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\n*   **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    γ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3\n\n*   **Calculate β:**\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400)\n\n*   **Calculate βγ:**\n    βγ = (√(391)/20) * (20/3) = √(391)/3 ≈ 6.591\n\nNext, we use this value to calculate the mean decay distance.\n\n*   **Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n    d = βγ * (ħc / Γ_X)\n    d ≈ 6.591 * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    d ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\n    d ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nFinally, we convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m).\n\n*   **Conversion:**\n    1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m\n    d ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
