    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nFor simplicity, we use the given energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL², so the single-particle energy levels are:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on, where n is the principal quantum number (n=1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (n) and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Two particles occupy the n=1 level.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the n=2 level.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration achievable by moving one particle from the ground state arrangement to a higher, unoccupied energy level. The least energetic promotion is to move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level.\n*   One particle is promoted to the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n2.  Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest value is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
