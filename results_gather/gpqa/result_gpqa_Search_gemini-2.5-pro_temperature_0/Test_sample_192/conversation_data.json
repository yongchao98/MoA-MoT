    "To determine how the number of stars per unit distance changes with distance, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Use the given information.** The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance.** By substituting the relationship from step 1 into the given information, we can find how the total number of stars up to a certain distance `r` depends on `r`:\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `N ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`, which simplifies to `N ∝ r^5`.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.** The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* changes with `r`. This is equivalent to finding the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of `N` with respect to `r` (`dN/dr`).\n\n    If we let `N = k * r^5` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), then the derivative is:\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n\n5.  **Find the final proportionality.** From the derivative, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance per unit range of distance as `r^4`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
