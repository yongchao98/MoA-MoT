    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it applies to energy and time.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is given by the relation: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). This principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. The shorter the lifetime of a state, the larger the uncertainty in its energy.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each quantum state. We can approximate the minimum uncertainty using ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in electron-volts seconds (eV·s) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor the first state (State 1):\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nFor the second state (State 2):\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference (ΔE_diff) must be significantly larger than the individual energy uncertainties. A common criterion for resolvability is that the energy difference should be at least the sum of the individual energy uncertainties:\n\nΔE_diff > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nΔE_diff > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nΔE_diff > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nΔE_diff > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, let's examine the given options to see which one satisfies this condition:\n\nA) 10⁻¹¹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁸ eV\nC) 10⁻⁹ eV\nD) 10⁻⁴ eV\n\nComparing our calculated minimum energy difference with the options:\n*   10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would be sufficient to clearly distinguish these two energy levels.\n\n<<<D>>>"
