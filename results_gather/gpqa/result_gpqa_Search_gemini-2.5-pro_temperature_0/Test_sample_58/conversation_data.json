    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which species is in excess after neutralization.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.\n\nNeutralization reactions occur between acids and bases. The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)₂) will react first, followed by any remaining strong species reacting with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n1.  **Strong Acid vs. Strong Base:**\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions will react with OH⁻ ions in a 1:1 ratio: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH⁻, the H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n2.  **Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid:**\n    *   Now, the remaining 0.100 mol of OH⁻ will react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant in this step.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the final pH.\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of a strong base (OH⁻). The presence of this strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n2.  **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
