    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atomic nucleus, typically a hydrogen atom. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a ring structure with two carbonyl (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three keto groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbon atoms located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable. The equilibrium between the keto and enol forms exists, confirming that it shows tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound indicates a propanoate chain with a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the second carbon. Let's examine the groups attached to the second carbon atom:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups are different, the second carbon is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. The structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not have a chiral center. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = benzoquinone\n*   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
