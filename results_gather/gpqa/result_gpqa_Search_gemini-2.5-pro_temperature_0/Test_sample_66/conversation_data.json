    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, to both have the eigenvalue `-Ä§`. This corresponds to finding the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` to be -1.\n\nThe state of the two-electron system is given as a coupled angular momentum state: `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\nHere:\n*   `l_1 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   `l_2 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. In terms of their respective quantum numbers, this relationship is expressed as:\n`m = m_1 + m_2`\n\nThe system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is definitively -1. This means that any measurement of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` must yield values that sum to -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the state of the system.\nFor this outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n`m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known total magnetic quantum number of the system (`m = -1`). Because the state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not a possible component of the given state `|l=2, m=-1>`, the two states are orthogonal.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` is zero. The coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states where `m_1 + m_2 = -1` (specifically, the states `|m_1=0, m_2=-1>` and `|m_1=-1, m_2=0>`). The state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not included in this superposition, so its probability amplitude is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>"
