    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we first need to calculate the individual expectation values of σ_z and σ_x for the given quantum state and then combine them.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nThis can be written as a column vector:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe bra corresponding to this state is:\n⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x are represented as:\nσ_z = [, [0, -1]]\nσ_x = [,]\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of σ_z (⟨σ_z⟩):**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩.\nFirst, apply σ_z to |ψ⟩:\nσ_z|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2), 0*0.5 + (-1)*(√3/2)] = [0.5, -√3/2]\n\nNow, calculate the inner product ⟨ψ| (σ_z|ψ⟩):\n⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2] = (0.5 * 0.5) + ((√3)/2 * (-√3)/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σ_x (⟨σ_x⟩):**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.\nFirst, apply σ_x to |ψ⟩:\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2] = [0*0.5 + 1*(√3/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2)] = [√3/2, 0.5]\n\nNow, calculate the inner product ⟨ψ| (σ_x|ψ⟩):\n⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5] = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨σ_x⟩ ≈ 1.732 / 2 = 0.866\n\n**3. Calculate the total expectation value:**\n\nThe expectation value of the full operator is 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩.\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n= -5 + 2.5 * √3\n≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n≈ -5 + 4.33\n≈ -0.67\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives -0.7.\n\n<<<A>>>"
