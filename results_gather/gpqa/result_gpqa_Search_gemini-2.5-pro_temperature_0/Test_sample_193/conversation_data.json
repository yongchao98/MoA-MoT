    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nFirst, we will list all 8 possible spin configurations and calculate the energy for each one:\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **Two spins up, one spin down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    There are three states with this configuration, all having an energy of E = J.\n\n3.  **One spin up, two spins down:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    There are three states with this configuration, all also having an energy of E = J.\n\n4.  **All spins down:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNext, we group the states by their energy levels and count the number of states (degeneracy) for each energy level:\n\n*   **Energy E = -3J:** This energy level occurs for two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n*   **Energy E = J:** This energy level occurs for the remaining six states. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be calculated by summing over the energy levels multiplied by their degeneracies:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nZ = g₁ * e^(-β(-3J)) + g₂ * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nB) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
