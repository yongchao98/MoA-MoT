    "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the electron-positron annihilation.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy of the system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy (E_e):**\n    *   Given Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4.\n    *   E_e = 4 * m_e * c² (where m_e is the rest mass of an electron).\n\n*   **Positron's Energy (E_p):**\n    *   The positron has the same rest mass as the electron.\n    *   Given Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2.\n    *   E_p = 2 * m_e * c²\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²\n\nAfter the annihilation, this total energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. The problem states that the photons have the same energy (E_ph).\n\n*   **Total Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   E_final = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy:\nE_initial = E_final\n6m_e c² = 2 * E_ph\n**E_ph = 3m_e c²**\n\nEach photon has an energy of 3m_e c².\n\n### 2. Conservation of Momentum\n\nNext, we apply the conservation of momentum. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum (p_e):**\n    *   The electron moves from the left (positive x-direction).\n    *   p_e = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √15 * m_e * c\n\n*   **Positron's Momentum (p_p):**\n    *   The positron moves from the right (negative x-direction).\n    *   p_p = -√(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -√3 * m_e * c\n\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (P_initial):**\n    *   The collision is along the horizontal axis, so we only consider the x-component.\n    *   P_initial_x = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c\n\nThe momentum of a photon is p = E/c. Since each photon has an energy of 3m_e c², the magnitude of each photon's momentum is:\n*   **Photon Momentum (p_ph):**\n    *   p_ph = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c\n\nThe photons are emitted in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Due to momentum conservation in the vertical (y) direction, the angles of emission must be symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle θ. The total angle between the photons will be 2θ.\n\n*   **Total Final Momentum (P_final):**\n    *   The horizontal component of the momentum for the two photons is p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ).\n    *   P_final_x = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ) = 6m_e c * cos(θ)\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum:\nP_initial_x = P_final_x\n(√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6m_e c * cos(θ)\n\nWe can solve for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n### 3. Calculating the Angle\n\nNow, we calculate the value of θ and then the final angle 2θ.\n\n*   Using the approximate values: √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732.\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe angle between the two photons is 2θ.\nAngle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<C>>>"
