    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n`Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is zero, so the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nTherefore:\n`p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n`p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n\nThis gives us the relationship:\n`m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`(0.66 * M) * T1_classical = (0.33 * M) * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_classical`:\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nFor the relativistic case, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, where total energy `E = T + mc^2`.\nThis can be rearranged to find the momentum: `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2`.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c^2`\n\nWe know `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`, so `T2 = 3 - T1`. We also have the rest-mass energies `m1c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert this value to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
