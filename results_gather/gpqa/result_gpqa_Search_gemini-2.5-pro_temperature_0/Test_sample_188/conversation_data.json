    "Phonons, pions, and magnons are all examples of Goldstone bosons (or in the case of pions, pseudo-Goldstone bosons), which are the characteristic excitations that arise when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\n*   **Phonon:** A phonon is a collective excitation in a crystal lattice. The formation of a crystal spontaneously breaks the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of free space. Phonons are the Goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of translational symmetry.\n*   **Pion:** A pion is a meson that is understood as the pseudo-Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This symmetry would be exact if the up and down quarks were massless, but since they have small masses, the symmetry is only approximate, and the pions are not perfectly massless.\n*   **Magnon:** A magnon is a collective excitation of the spin structure in a magnetic material. In a ferromagnet, for instance, all the magnetic spins align in a particular direction below a critical temperature, spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry of the system. Magnons are the Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken symmetry.\n*   **Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like solution (a soliton) in a field theory. While skyrmions can arise in theories that also describe spontaneous symmetry breaking (for example, as topological excitations of the pion field, which itself is made of Goldstone bosons), the skyrmion itself is not a Goldstone boson. It is a massive, stable configuration, whereas Goldstone bosons are the massless (or light) fluctuations associated with the broken symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle that is not itself a Goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
