    "To determine the probability of obtaining 0 for P and -1 for Q in respective measurements, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements. This involves calculating the probability of the first measurement, determining the state of the system after this measurement, and then calculating the probability of the second measurement on the new state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State:** The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`. First, we need to normalize this state. The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`. The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n    The normalized initial state is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`.\n\n2.  **First Measurement (P=0):** The measurement of an observable yields one of its eigenvalues. The problem states that the measurement of P gives the value 0. We need to find the eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n    The matrix for P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    The eigenvalues of P are found to be -1, 0, and 1. The normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is:\n    `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring P=0:** The probability of measuring P and obtaining the value 0 is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` and the normalized initial state `|ψ_norm⟩`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)] ⋅ [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)] = (1/√12) * ((-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1) = 2/√12 = 1/√3`\n    Therefore, `Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n4.  **State Collapse:** After the measurement of P yields 0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)`\n\n5.  **Second Measurement (Q=-1):** Now, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The matrix for Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. We are interested in the outcome Q=-1. The corresponding normalized eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` is:\n    `|q_{-1}⟩ = (0, 0, 1)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q=-1:** The probability of measuring Q and obtaining -1 is calculated from the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [(0, 0, 1)] ⋅ [(1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)] = (1/√2) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1) = 1/√2`\n    Therefore, `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n7.  **Total Probability:** The total probability for this sequence of measurements is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n    `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
