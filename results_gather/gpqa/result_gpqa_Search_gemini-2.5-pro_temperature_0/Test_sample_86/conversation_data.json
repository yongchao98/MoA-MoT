    "To identify the correct 1H NMR data, let's first determine the possible structure of the compound based on the given information.\n\n### **Structural Analysis**\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The compound is based on a benzene ring with two substituents.\n2.  **8 carbon atoms in total:** A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms, which means the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n4.  **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the halogen is one substituent, and the other substituent must contain two carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable structure that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone. The two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). To have the simplest and most distinct NMR spectrum presented in the options, a para (1,4) substitution pattern is the most likely arrangement.\n\nThe proposed structure is **p-haloacetophenone** (for example, 4-chloroacetophenone).\n\n### **1H NMR Prediction and Analysis of Options**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a p-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given choices.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-substituted benzene ring, the protons are split into two distinct sets. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent protons (ortho to the acetyl group), causing them to appear downfield (at a higher ppm value). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing. This pattern typically results in two doublets in the aromatic region (usually between 7.0 and 8.0 ppm). Since there are four protons on the ring, we expect to see a 2H doublet and another 2H doublet.\n*   **Methyl Protons:** The acetyl group's methyl protons (-COCH₃) are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a singlet. This signal is expected to have an integration of 3H and a chemical shift of around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct data for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   It also shows a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is the expected chemical shift and multiplicity for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a p-haloacetophenone. For instance, the actual reported shifts for 4-chloroacetophenone are approximately 7.90 ppm (d, 2H), 7.45 ppm (d, 2H), and 2.55 ppm (s, 3H), which is in very close agreement with this option.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, but this option shows only one proton in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option C is the only one that correctly represents the 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
