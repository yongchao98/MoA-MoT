    "The search results confirm the formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the probability of it transiting its host star is approximately the ratio of the stellar radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). This is given by the formula P_transit ≈ R_s / a.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s). The law can be expressed as P² ∝ a³ / M_s, which can be rearranged to a³ ∝ P² * M_s.\n\nThe initial calculation was as follows:\n\n1.  **Ratio of semi-major axes:**\n    a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n    a1 / a2 = [(P1² * M_s1) / (P2² * M_s2)]^(1/3)\n\n2.  **Given relationships:**\n    *   P2 = 3 * P1  => P1 / P2 = 1/3\n    *   M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 => M_s1 / M_s2 = 2\n\n3.  **Substitute values:**\n    a1 / a2 = [ (1/3)² * 2 ]^(1/3)\n    a1 / a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Ratio of transit probabilities:**\n    P_t1 / P_t2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n    Since R_s1 = R_s2, this simplifies to:\n    P_t1 / P_t2 = a2 / a1\n\n5.  **Calculate the final ratio:**\n    P_t1 / P_t2 = 1 / ( (2/9)^(1/3) )\n    P_t1 / P_t2 = (9/2)^(1/3)\n    P_t1 / P_t2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n    P_t1 / P_t2 ≈ 1.65\n\nThis confirms that Planet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the logic and calculations.\n- The transit probability formula is correct for circular orbits.\n- Kepler's Third Law is correctly applied.\n- The algebraic manipulation is correct.\n- The numerical calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit is sound.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\nThe probability of a planet transiting its star is proportional to the stellar radius divided by the planet's orbital semi-major axis (P_transit ∝ R_s / a). Since both host stars have the same radii (R_s1 = R_s2), the ratio of the transit probabilities is inversely proportional to the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\nP_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = a2 / a1\n\nTo find the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the stellar mass (M_s). This can be written as a³ ∝ P² * M_s.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (P2 = 3 * P1).\n*   The host star of Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2 (M_s1 = 2 * M_s2).\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\n(a1/a2)³ = (P1²/P2²) * (M_s1/M_s2)\n(a1/a2)³ = (P1 / (3*P1))² * (2*M_s2 / M_s2)\n(a1/a2)³ = (1/3)² * 2\n(a1/a2)³ = 2/9\na1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of this:\n\nP_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = a2 / a1 = 1 / ( (2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5 gives approximately 1.65.\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 has a transit probability that is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
