  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).

    "An analysis of the genetic interactions between G1, G2, and G3 based on the provided knockout mutant data allows for the deduction of their roles in the anthracnose resistance pathway.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\n*   **g2 (0% resistance):** The complete loss of resistance in the g2 mutant indicates that the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway.\n*   **g1 (75% resistance):** The partial loss of resistance suggests G1 contributes to the pathway but is not the sole factor. Its absence leads to a 25% reduction in resistance.\n*   **g3 (50% resistance):** The significant drop in resistance indicates G3 is a major contributor to the pathway, responsible for 50% of the resistance.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants and Epistasis\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. In a regulatory pathway, a common rule is that the gene acting downstream is epistatic to the gene acting upstream.\n\n*   **g1g2 (0% resistance):** The phenotype of the g1g2 double mutant is identical to that of the g2 single mutant (0% resistance), not the g1 mutant (75% resistance). This means the g2 mutation masks the g1 mutation's effect. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**, which implies G2 acts downstream of G1 in the pathway.\n*   **g2g3 (0% resistance):** Similarly, the phenotype of the g2g3 double mutant is identical to the g2 single mutant. This means **G2 is also epistatic to G3**, placing G2 downstream of G3 as well.\n*   **g1g3 (10% resistance):** The phenotype of the g1g3 double mutant is more severe than either single mutant and is not identical to either one. This indicates a synergistic interaction between G1 and G3, suggesting they may function in parallel to activate a downstream component. Neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other.\n\n### Reconstructing the Pathway\nBased on the epistasis analysis, both G1 and G3 act upstream of G2. A plausible model is that G1 and G3 are parallel inputs that converge on the essential G2 gene.\n\n```\n   G1 ↘\n        G2 → Resistance\n   G3 ↗\n```\n\n### Evaluating the Role of the Transcription Factor\nThe problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of another. In the derived pathway, G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. This makes either G1 or G3 a candidate for a transcription factor that regulates G2. G2, being downstream of both, is unlikely to be the transcription factor for G1 or G3.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. G2 is downstream, not the likely transcription factor for G1/G3, and G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect for the same reasons as A, and the genes are not redundant as single mutants have strong effects.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. G2 is downstream, and G3 is not epistatic to G1.\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This option is the most consistent with the data.\n    *   **G1 is a transcription factor:** This is plausible, as G1 is upstream of G2.\n    *   **G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is a correct interpretation of the experimental data.\n    *   **G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:** Pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this single experiment, but its inclusion does not invalidate the other correct statements in this option.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is presented in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
