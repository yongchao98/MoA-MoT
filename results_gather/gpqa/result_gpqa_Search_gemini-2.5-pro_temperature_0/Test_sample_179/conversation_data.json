    "The problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles. Twelve of these particles are on the surface of a sphere, and the thirteenth is at the center. The total electrostatic potential energy of this system is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges.\n\nThis total energy can be broken down into two main components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  The potential energy from the mutual interaction of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nLet `q` be the charge of each particle, which is `2e`. Let `R` be the radius of the sphere, which is 2 m. Let `k` be Coulomb's constant.\n\n**1. Energy of Interaction between Central and Spherical Charges**\n\nThe potential energy `U_pair` between the central charge and a single charge on the sphere is given by:\n`U_pair = k * q^2 / R`\n\nSince there are 12 such charges on the sphere, the total energy for this component (`U_central`) is:\n`U_central = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**2. Energy of Interaction among Charges on the Sphere**\n\nTo achieve a minimum energy state, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves into a configuration that maximizes their separation. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration (`U_sphere`) can be expressed as:\n`U_sphere = E_12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\nwhere `E_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for the icosahedral configuration. The accepted value for `E_12` is approximately 49.165335.\n\n**Total Minimum Energy**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_central + U_sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (E_12 * k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total = (12 + E_12) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total = (12 + 49.165335) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total = 61.165335 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**Calculation**\n\nThe values of the constants are:\n*   `q = 2e = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19` C (The elementary charge `e` is an exact value in the SI system).\n*   `R = 2` m\n*   `k ≈ 8.9875517923 × 10^9` N⋅m²/C²\n\nFirst, we calculate the term `k * q^2 / R`:\n*   `q^2 = (2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19)^2 ≈ 1.02678789 × 10^-37` C²\n*   `k * q^2 / R = (8.9875517923 × 10^9 * 1.02678789 × 10^-37) / 2`\n*   `k * q^2 / R ≈ 4.614165 × 10^-28` J\n\nNow, we can find the total energy:\n*   `U_total = 61.165335 * (4.614165 × 10^-28)` J\n*   `U_total ≈ 2.82215 × 10^-26` J\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is `2.822 × 10^-26` J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
