    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate distance and parallax:** The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (d). We can express this as `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Consider a volume of space:** Imagine a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Assume uniform star distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume (the number density, ρ) is constant everywhere.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of stars in the shell:** The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the number density (ρ) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`).\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Express the relationship in terms of parallax:** We need to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we must substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   From step 1, we have `d = k/plx`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   To find `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`, we differentiate this equation: `dd/d(plx) = -k/plx²`. We are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign, which just indicates that distance and parallax are inversely related. Thus, `dd = (k/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (k/plx)² * (k/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (k²/plx²) * (k/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρk³) / plx⁴ * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the final relationship:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = (4πρk³) / plx⁴`\n\nSince `4`, `π`, `ρ`, and `k` are all constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. This relationship is also noted in discussions of the Lutz-Kelker bias, which arises from the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
