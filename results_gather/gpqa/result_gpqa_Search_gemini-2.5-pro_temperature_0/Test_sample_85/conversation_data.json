    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products**\n\n*   **Reaction A Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction B Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nBoth products are δ-lactones (six-membered cyclic esters). They are enantiomers of each other. The chiral center is at position 4 of the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Determine the Precursor to the Lactone**\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\nThe structure of the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, indicates that its open-chain precursor is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH\n\nThe chiral center in this precursor is at C3. Upon cyclization, the C3 of the acid becomes the C4 of the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the chiral center is conserved during the lactonization step.\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will cyclize to (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Starting Materials and the Transformation**\n\nThe options for the starting materials (A and B) are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n\n*   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n\nThis molecule has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1 and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-iBu) at C5. The chiral center is at C3.\n\nTo get the required precursor (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid) from this starting material, a reduction must occur. Comparing the structures, the ester group at C5 must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group at C1 must remain unchanged.\n\n**Transformation:**\nHOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu  →  HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n\n### **4. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Starting Material A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization of the resulting 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C3. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the precursor must be (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which in turn must come from the (R)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Starting Material B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is well-known for its high chemoselectivity, typically reducing carboxylic acids much faster than esters. However, for the reaction to yield the given product (a 4-ethyl-lactone), the ester group must be reduced, not the carboxylic acid. Reduction of the carboxylic acid would lead to a different product (a 3-ethyl-lactone), which is not observed.\n*   **Mechanism:** We must infer from the product that under the conditions of this specific reaction, the BH₃ reagent reduces the ester group to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) leads to the lactone. While this reactivity is atypical for BH₃, we must assume it occurs to yield the stated product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, the chiral center is not affected by the reduction or cyclization. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the precursor must be (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which must come from the (S)-starting material.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
