    "To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, we must first identify the key steps. The final product is an aldol addition product formed from two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Therefore, the primary challenge is to convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options step-by-step:\n\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The first step in options B, C, and D involves deprotonating the terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) with sodium amide (NaNH2) to form a sodium acetylide. This is a standard reaction. This acetylide then reacts with an alkyl halide (methyl chloride in B and C, ethyl chloride in D) to form an internal alkyne.\n*   **Step 2: Reduction.** The second step involves reducing the newly formed internal alkyne to an alkene.\n    *   In option B, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst) is used. This catalyst is specifically designed to reduce an alkyne to a *cis* (or Z) alkene and stop the reaction at the alkene stage.\n    *   In option C, H2/Pd is used, which would reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane, making the subsequent ozonolysis step impossible.\n    *   In option D, Li/liq. NH3 is used, which reduces an internal alkyne to a *trans* (or E) alkene.\n*   **Step 3: Oxidative Cleavage.** The third step is the cleavage of the alkene's double bond.\n    *   In options B and C, ozonolysis with a reductive workup (O3/ (CH3)2S) is proposed. This reaction cleaves a double bond to form two carbonyl compounds, typically aldehydes or ketones. Applying this to the *cis*-alkene from step 2 of option B, (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene, would yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    *   In option D, ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (O3/ H2O) is proposed. This would oxidize the alkene fragments to carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde.\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Addition.** The final step is the self-condensation of the aldehyde intermediate.\n    *   In option B, barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base, is used to catalyze the aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the desired Î±-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n    *   The other options either fail before this step or propose less common/suitable catalysts for this specific transformation.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **A)** Fails at step 1, as NaNH2 would react with the methanol solvent instead of deprotonating the alkyne.\n*   **B)** This sequence is chemically sound. It successfully produces the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and then uses a standard base catalyst to perform the required aldol addition.\n*   **C)** Fails at step 2, as the complete reduction to an alkane prevents the necessary ozonolysis.\n*   **D)** Fails at step 3, as the oxidative workup would produce a carboxylic acid instead of the aldehyde needed for the final step.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B presents the only correct and viable sequence of reactions to achieve the desired synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
