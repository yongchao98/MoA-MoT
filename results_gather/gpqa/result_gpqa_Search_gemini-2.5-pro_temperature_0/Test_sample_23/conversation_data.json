    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula simplifies to `y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428`.\n*   This gives `y ≈ 0.1428 * (12x + y)`, which simplifies to `0.8572y ≈ 1.7136x`, or `y/x ≈ 2`.\n*   The empirical formula is CH₂, and the molecular formula is (CH₂)n or CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is saturated (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane (CnH2n) is `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given data.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n**2. Characterize Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Mixture X, which is unsaturated, is converted to the saturated/aromatic mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. This points towards a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction. A well-known example is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where an unsaturated cyclic compound disproportionates into a saturated cycloalkane and an aromatic compound.\n*   For a C₆ system, a cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene would disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's hypothesize that mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Benzene, due to its aromatic stability, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. So, mixture Y fits this description.\n    *   Upon hydrogenation, cyclohexane does not react, while benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). Thus, hydrogenating mixture Y gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits the problem description perfectly.\n\n**3. Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   We have established the reaction that forms Y: `A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`, where A and B are the equimolar components of mixture X.\n*   By balancing the atoms, the sum of the formulas of A and B must be C₁₂H₁₈.\n*   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and both get hydrogenated to the same C₆ skeleton (cyclohexane), they must both be C₆ hydrocarbons, let's say C₆Hx and C₆Hy.\n*   Therefore, x + y = 18.\n*   The properties of mixture X are:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both A and B yields only cyclohexane (Z). This confirms they must have a six-membered ring structure.\n*   Let's find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C₆ cyclic isomers that fit the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** is a prime candidate. It has one double bond and would decolorize bromine water. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   To satisfy x + y = 18, if A is C₆H₁₀, then B must be C₆H₈.\n    *   We need a non-conjugated C₆H₈ isomer with a six-membered ring. **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** fits this description perfectly. Its two double bonds are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. It also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The other common isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus ruled out.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mix of cyclohexene (A = C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (B = C₆H₈).\n*   The disproportionation reaction is: C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene). This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the monoene is reduced to the alkane.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
