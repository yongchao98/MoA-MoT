    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before experiencing a collision. It is inversely proportional to the density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is λ = 1 / (nσ). In this problem, the number density of gas molecules (n) is constant for both scenarios. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 depends entirely on the difference between their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n2.  **Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   λ1 is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with each other.\n    *   The relevant cross-section here is the kinetic cross-section (σ_gas), which is determined by the physical size of the gas molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of diameter 'd', the effective cross-section is σ_gas = √2 * π * d². This represents a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n\n3.  **Analyzing λ2 (Electron-Gas Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   λ2 is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam scattering off the gas molecules.\n    *   The relevant cross-section is the electron scattering cross-section (σ_electron).\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV (1 MeV), making them highly energetic and relativistic.\n    *   A collision, in this context, means a scattering event significant enough to remove the electron from the beam's path or cause significant energy loss, which would affect the microscope's resolution.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas vs. σ_electron):**\n    *   **Gas-Gas Cross-Section (σ_gas):** This is based on the physical size of the molecules, on the order of 10⁻¹⁹ m².\n    *   **Electron-Gas Cross-Section (σ_electron):** A high-energy (1 MeV) electron is a tiny, fast-moving particle. From its perspective, a gas molecule is mostly empty space. Significant scattering only occurs during a close encounter with the strong electric field of the atom's nucleus or its electrons (inelastic collision). While low-energy electrons can have large interaction cross-sections due to long-range electrostatic forces, the scattering cross-section for high-energy electrons decreases significantly with increasing energy.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of a high-energy electron being significantly scattered by a gas molecule is much lower than the probability of two gas molecules colliding with each other. This means the effective cross-section for the electron is much smaller than the kinetic cross-section of the gas molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **σ_electron << σ_gas**.\n\n5.  **Concluding the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the cross-section (σ), and σ_electron is much smaller than σ_gas, the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be much larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n    *   Therefore, **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This suggests λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1. This contradicts the finding that λ2 should be *much* larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This is consistent with the conclusion that λ2 is larger than λ1. It sets a minimum difference and allows for λ2 to be much larger, which is expected.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect because the underlying physical interactions and cross-sections are different.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: This would imply that the electron scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas cross-section, which is incorrect for the high-energy electrons in a 1000 kV TEM.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Option B is the only one that correctly reflects this relationship.\n\n<<<D>>>"
