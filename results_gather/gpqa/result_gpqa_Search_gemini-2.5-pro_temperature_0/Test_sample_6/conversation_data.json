    "The problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) that can annihilate with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$) pair. This process is represented by the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nTo solve this, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. The reaction is possible if the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products, which in this case is an electron and a positron.\n\nKey values needed for the calculation are:\n*   **Rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$)**: Approximately 0.511 MeV. Since a positron has the same mass, the total rest mass energy required to create the pair is 2 * $m_e c^2$ ≈ 1.022 MeV.\n*   **Average energy of a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$)**: Given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n\nThe threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$) occurs when the collision with the CMB photon is head-on. This configuration maximizes the energy available in the center-of-mass frame. The formula for the threshold energy is derived from the invariance of the four-momentum squared and is given by:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into this formula:\n\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare this result with the given options, we need to convert the energy from electronvolts (eV) to giga-electronvolts (GeV), knowing that 1 GeV = $10^9$ eV:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value matches option C. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies at or above approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
