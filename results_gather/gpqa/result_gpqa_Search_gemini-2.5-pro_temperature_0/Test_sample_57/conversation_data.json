    "Of the options provided, Superstring Theory is the one conjectured to not require regularization at high energies. Here is a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory, QCD requires regularization to handle the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that appear in calculations. Methods like lattice regularization are used to make the theory's calculations finite.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory suffers from a divergence in the self-energy of a point-like charge. While mathematical procedures have been explored to remove these divergences, the problem is a classic example of a high-energy/short-distance issue in a classical theory.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED was the first quantum field theory where the problem of infinities in calculations became apparent. It fundamentally requires a process of regularization and subsequent renormalization to make finite, measurable predictions.\n\n*   **A) Superstring Theory:** A key motivation for superstring theory is its potential to be a \"UV-finite\" theory of quantum gravity. Unlike point particles in quantum field theory, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings. This extended nature is believed to smooth out interactions at very short distances (high energies), thus avoiding the infinities that plague other theories and eliminating the need for regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
