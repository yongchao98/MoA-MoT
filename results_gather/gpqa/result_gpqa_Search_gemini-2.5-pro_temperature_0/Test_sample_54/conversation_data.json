    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the spectral data and its interpretation:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This singlet signal with an integration of three protons corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) of the acetate functionality. It is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons to cause splitting.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This doublet signal, integrating to three protons, is the methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-CH=). It appears as a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinyl proton.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is from one of the protons on the double bond. Its downfield chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom from the acetate group. The multiplicity is a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton. The large coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* relationship between two vinyl protons. Coupling constants for *trans* protons are typically in the 11-18 Hz range, whereas *cis* protons show smaller coupling constants (usually 6-15 Hz).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents the second proton on the double bond. Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet splitting is caused by the coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm) with the same J value of 16.0 Hz. The quartet splitting arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\nThe combination of a *trans* coupling constant and the specific splitting patterns (singlet, doublet, and doublet of quartets) perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The other options are inconsistent with the data; Cis-propenyl acetate would have a smaller J-coupling constant, and the butenyl acetate isomers would produce different splitting patterns altogether.\n\n<<<A>>>"
