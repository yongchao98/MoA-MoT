    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. This is not a standard elimination or substitution reaction due to the bridgehead positions of the bromine atoms. These harsh conditions promote a skeletal rearrangement of the adamantane cage. The resulting product, which has a characteristic ketone IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The ¹H NMR data provided, particularly the unusual deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm, is consistent with the known spectrum of this rearranged cage ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The heating, in conjunction with the Lewis acidic nature of the aluminum reagent, promotes a subsequent dehydration of the initially formed alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol). This reduction-dehydration cascade is a known process. The final product of this step is an alkene, **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and, with reductive workup, replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene opens one of the rings in the cage structure, leading to the formation of a dicarbonyl compound. The resulting structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** The structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione has several types of protons. The protons alpha to the two ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, 6, and 8) are deshielded. However, the two bridgehead protons (at positions 1 and 5) are beta to *two* carbonyl groups. This cumulative deshielding effect makes the bridgehead protons the most deshielded in the molecule, a fact confirmed by spectral data.\n\n2.  **Determining the Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the couplings for the bridgehead proton at position 1 (H1). This proton is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbon atoms: C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   The molecule predominantly exists in a rigid chair-chair conformation.\n    *   H1 is coupled to six neighboring protons in total: two on C2, two on C8, and two on C9.\n    *   **Simplifying Assumption 1 (Dihedral Angle):** The coupling constant between protons with a dihedral angle of approximately 90° is close to zero. In the chair-chair conformation, the angle between the bridgehead proton (H1) and the adjacent *axial* protons (H2ax and H8ax) is nearly 90°. Therefore, we can assume their coupling is negligible. This leaves four neighboring protons to consider: H2eq, H8eq, H9syn, and H9anti.\n    *   **Simplifying Assumption 2 (Equivalence):** For introductory and intermediate-level problems, certain non-equivalent protons are sometimes treated as equivalent to simplify the resulting splitting pattern. By symmetry, the coupling of H1 to H2eq is identical to its coupling to H8eq (let's call this J_A). The two protons on the C9 bridge (H9syn and H9anti) are chemically different, but if we approximate their coupling to H1 as being equivalent (J_B), we get a simplified model.\n\n3.  **Final Pattern:** Based on these standard simplifications, the bridgehead proton (H1) is coupled to two equivalent equatorial protons (H2eq, H8eq) with a coupling constant J_A, which gives a **triplet**. This signal is further split by the two C9 protons (treated as equivalent) with a coupling constant J_B, which results in another **triplet**. Therefore, the overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
