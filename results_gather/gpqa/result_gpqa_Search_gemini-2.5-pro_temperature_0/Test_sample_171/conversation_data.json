    "This problem can be solved by applying the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate given the assumption that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels (a higher state `j` and a lower state `i`):\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the populations of the energy levels `j` and `i`.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's define the ratio of populations (the \"excitation\") as `R = N_j / N_i`. We can write the equation for each star:\n\n1.  **For star 1 (temperature T_1):**\n    R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n2.  **For star 2 (temperature T_2):**\n    R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, so `R_1 = 2 * R_2`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R_1 and R_2:\n\n(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` is a property of the iron atom and cancels out from both sides:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The value of the Boltzmann constant `k` is also `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n\n1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
