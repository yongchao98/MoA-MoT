    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Normalize the state |α>**\n\nThe given state is `|α'> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. To normalize it, we need to find the normalization constant C such that `|α> = C|α'>` and `<α|α> = 1`.\n\nThe inner product `<α'|α'>` is calculated as:\n`<α'|α'> = [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|] ⋅ [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n`<α'|α'> = (1-i)(1+i)<up|up> + (2+i)(2-i)<down|down>`\nSince `<up|up> = 1` and `<down|down> = 1`, we have:\n`<α'|α'> = (1 - i²) + (4 - i²) = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant C is `1/sqrt(<α'|α'>)`, so `C = 1/√7`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n**2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. This gives the matrix:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is proportional to the Pauli matrix σₓ.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y] = (ħ/2) * [x, y]`\n    `[y, x] = [x, y]`, which implies `x = y`.\n    The normalized eigenstate is `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1] = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y] = -(ħ/2) * [x, y]`\n    `[y, x] = [-x, -y]`, which implies `y = -x`.\n    The normalized eigenstate is `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**3. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vᵢ>` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√2) * [1, 1] ⋅ (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14`\n    `P(+ħ/2) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] ⋅ (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P(-ħ/2) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Calculate the average value of the operator**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of A is given by `<A> = <α|A|α>`. It can also be calculated using the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n`<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
