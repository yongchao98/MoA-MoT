    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the chemical transformation that occurs.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are also reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be fully reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will result in the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl (aldehyde)** group at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to a **cyclohexane** skeleton.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule, which consists of 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group), remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane, specifically a disubstituted ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane. The exact IUPAC name (e.g., 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane) is not necessary to determine the molecular formula.\n\nSince the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula will be CₙH₂ₙ, which is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the molecular formula:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the saturated cycloalkane product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
