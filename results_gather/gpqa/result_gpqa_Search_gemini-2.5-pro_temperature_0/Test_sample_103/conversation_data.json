    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Doppler effect for light relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r) of the source:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n\n    This means that the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity variation (K).\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    For the two planets, we have:\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star + mₚ)^(2/3)\n\n    Let's analyze the terms based on the information provided:\n    *   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n    *   **P** is the orbital period we need to relate.\n    *   **mₚ** is the planet's mass. The problem states both planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, this typically refers to the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i). We will assume (mₚ sin(i)) is the same for both systems.\n    *   **i** is the orbital inclination. As mentioned above, it's part of the mₚ sin(i) term.\n    *   **M_star** is the star's mass. The problem states the two stars have \"exactly the same masses.\"\n    *   The term (M_star + mₚ) can be approximated as M_star, since the mass of a Sun-like star is much greater than the mass of a Neptune-like planet.\n\n    Since M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, all parts of the equation are constant except for K and P. This gives us the proportionality:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can rearrange the proportionality to solve for the period, P:\n    If K ∝ P^(-1/3), then K³ ∝ P⁻¹, which means P ∝ K⁻³.\n\n    Now we can find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 (P₂) to that of planet #1 (P₁):\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n    Using the ratio of the radial velocities we found in step 1:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n    Calculating the final value:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
