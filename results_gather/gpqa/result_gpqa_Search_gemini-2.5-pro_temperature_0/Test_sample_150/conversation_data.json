    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The desired probability is found by projecting the system's state vector onto the eigenvector of the observable corresponding to the eigenvalue of 0.\n\n**1. Identify the State Vector and the Observable Operator:**\n*   The state of the system at time `t` is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   The observable `P` is represented by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P:**\nTo confirm that 0 is a possible measurement outcome, we find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n`det([[-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`-λ(λ² - 1/2) - 1/√2(-λ/√2) = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible result of the measurement.\n\n**3. Find the Normalized Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0:**\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that corresponds to `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\nThis yields the equations:\n*   `y/√2 = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n*   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]^T`. To normalize it, we set its length to 1: `c² + 0² + (-c)² = 1`, which gives `2c² = 1`, so `c = 1/√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n`|v₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n\n**4. Normalize the State Vector |ψ⟩:**\nThe probability calculation requires the state vector to be normalized. The squared norm of `|ψ⟩` is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability:**\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. This is calculated using the Born rule.\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n`= (1/√12) * [(-1) + 0 + (-1)]`\n`= -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\nFinally, square the result to find the probability:\n`Prob(0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n<<<D>>>"
