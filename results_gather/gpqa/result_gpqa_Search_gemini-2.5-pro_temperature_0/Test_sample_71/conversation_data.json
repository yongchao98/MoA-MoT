    "This multi-step synthesis problem describes the formation of a final product, **4**, whose chemical identity and, consequently, the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, must be determined.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of the Diene and Diels-Alder Reaction.** The starting material, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is an unusual structure. However, a chemically plausible interpretation, common in such problems, is that the name is a misnomer for a common precursor to a reactive diene. The most likely intended precursor is **1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene**. Upon treatment with sodium iodide, this compound generates the highly reactive diene **o-xylylene** (also known as o-quinodimethane) in situ. This diene then undergoes a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative). Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, both double bonds of the norbornadiene react, forming a bis-adduct, which is **product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydrolysis.** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This acidic condition cleaves the tert-butyl ether, converting the tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 position into a hydroxyl group (-OH). This alcohol is **product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation.** Product **2** is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidizing agent that converts the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O), yielding **product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermolysis and Dimerization.** Product **3** is heated to 150°C. This step is crucial and involves a cascade of reactions. The heating induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, causing the molecule to fragment. The central bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one core, now with regenerated double bonds (a 7-norbornadienone derivative), is unstable and decomposes by eliminating carbon monoxide (CO) to form stable benzene. This process releases the two o-xylylene molecules that were attached to the norbornadiene template. These two highly reactive o-xylylene molecules are generated in close proximity and immediately dimerize to form the final product, **4**.\n\n5.  **Structure and Symmetry of Product 4.** The dimerization of o-xylylene can, in principle, lead to several isomers. However, for such problems, the formation of a highly symmetrical product is often intended. One such product is the *syn*-[4+4] cyclodimer. Although this pathway is formally forbidden by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal concerted reactions, it can occur through a stepwise diradical mechanism and leads to a product with high symmetry. The structure of this dimer possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n\n6.  **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens.** To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the *syn*-[4+4] dimer of o-xylylene, we analyze its symmetry:\n    *   The molecule has a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the two benzene rings are chemically equivalent.\n    *   Within each benzene ring, the four aromatic protons are grouped into two equivalent pairs. This gives **2 signals** for the aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   The two methine (CH) protons on the central cyclobutane ring are equivalent, giving **1 signal**.\n    *   The two methylene (CH₂) groups are equivalent. The two protons within each methylene group are also equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. This gives **1 signal** for the methylene hydrogens.\n\nTherefore, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product **4** is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
