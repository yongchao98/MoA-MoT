    "To determine the major products of the two rearrangements, each reaction must be analyzed based on its mechanism.\n\n### Reaction A: (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+) → A\n\nThis reaction is a Wittig rearrangement. The starting material is benzyl prenyl ether, C₆H₅-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n\n1.  **Deprotonation**: Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic carbon. In this molecule, the benzylic protons (on the -CH₂- group attached to the phenyl ring) are the most acidic. This forms a carbanion.\n2.  **Rearrangement**: The resulting carbanion can undergo either a-Wittig or a-Wittig rearrangement.\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** is a concerted, pericyclic reaction that is generally favored under kinetic control (low temperatures).\n    *   The **-Wittig rearrangement** proceeds through a stepwise radical mechanism. This pathway can be competitive or even dominant if the radical intermediates are well-stabilized. In this case, the benzylic radical (Ph-CH•) that would form is highly stabilized by the phenyl ring.\n\nGiven the options, we must determine which product is formed.\n*   The product of the **-rearrangement** would be 1-phenyl-2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-ol. This compound is not listed in the options.\n*   The product of the **-rearrangement** is 1-phenyl-4-methylpent-3-en-1-ol. Let's verify the name: the main chain is a pentene with a hydroxyl group at position 1, a phenyl group at position 1, and a methyl group at position 4, which corresponds to **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**. This matches the product for A in options C and D. The preference for the-pathway is due to the stability of the benzylic radical intermediate.\n\nTherefore, product **A** is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n\n### Reaction B: 3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat → B\n\nThis reaction involves heating a complex polycyclic compound. The name indicates the presence of two \"dimethylene\" groups, which are part of two 1,5-diene systems within the molecule. The reaction condition \"Heat\" suggests a pericyclic reaction, and the preamble specifically mentions the Cope rearrangement.\n\nThe **Cope rearrangement** is a-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene. A key feature of this and other pericyclic reactions is that they are isomerizations. This means the product has the same molecular formula as the starting material; no atoms are gained or lost.\n\nLet's analyze the names of the products offered:\n*   **Starting Material**: ...-**hexahydro**-...\n*   **Product in Option C**: ...-**hexahydro**-...\n*   **Product in Option D**: ...-**tetrahydro**-...\n\nThe term \"hexahydro\" indicates that six hydrogen atoms have been added to a parent aromatic system to achieve the given structure. \"Tetrahydro\" indicates the addition of four hydrogens. A \"tetrahydro\" compound has two fewer hydrogen atoms and one additional degree of unsaturation (i.e., one more double bond or ring) than its \"hexahydro\" counterpart.\n\nSince the Cope rearrangement is an isomerization, the molecular formula must be conserved. A thermal reaction without any other reagents should not cause a loss of hydrogen atoms (oxidation). Therefore, the \"hexahydro\" starting material must rearrange to a \"hexahydro\" product.\n\nThus, product **B** must be **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   Product B is **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
