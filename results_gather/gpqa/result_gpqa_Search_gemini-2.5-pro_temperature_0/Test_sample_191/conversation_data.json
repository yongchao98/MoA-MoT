    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the neutral conductor will attract the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges inside the cavity and on the inner surface are shielded from the outside, and conversely, the charges on the outer surface are shielded from the specific arrangement of charges inside. This means the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is independent of the position of the charge `+q` or the cavity inside.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this surface to minimize repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to Gauss's Law (and the shell theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance `L` from the point P.\n    *   Therefore, the electric field at point P is calculated as if a point charge `+q` were located at the center of the large conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other variables, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its position `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field if the conductor were absent.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
