    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This planet is, by definition, a replica of Earth. Its average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm続.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm続, which is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For a planet with the same building blocks as Earth, having less mass means weaker self-gravity. This results in less compression of its materials. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's density of 5.51 g/cm続.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet, often categorized as a \"Super-Earth,\" has the same raw materials as Earth but significantly more mass. The immense gravitational force of this larger mass will compress the core and mantle to a much greater degree. This gravitational compression leads to a significantly higher bulk density. For a rocky planet with an Earth-like composition, the radius does not scale directly with mass; a planet 5 times the mass of Earth will be considerably denser.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet in option (c) will be the densest. The densities for the other planets are either equal to or less than Earth's. The 5-Earth-mass planet is the only one whose physical properties dictate a density substantially higher than Earth's due to intense gravitational compression.\n\n<<<C>>>"
