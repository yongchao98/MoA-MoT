    "This problem requires the application of the principle of time dilation from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame:** This is the \"stationary\" frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 60,000 km/s. So, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time that has passed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance, we need to know two things from the Galaxy's perspective: the ejecta's velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed (`Δt`).\n\nDistance in Galaxy Frame = `v * Δt`\n\n### 3. Calculate Time Dilation\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere the Lorentz factor `γ` is:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lorentz factor:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\nNow, we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`):\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nThis means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Distance\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time we just calculated (`Δt`) and the given velocity (`v`).\n\nDistance = `v * Δt`\nDistance = `60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96)`\nDistance = `3,000,000 km / √0.96`\nDistance ≈ `3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\nDistance ≈ `3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the value in option A.\n\n*   **Classical Calculation (Ignoring Relativity):** If we were to ignore relativistic effects, the distance would simply be `d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C).\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct calculation, accounting for time dilation, yields approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
