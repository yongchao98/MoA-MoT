    "To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each option against the laws of conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the given Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### Summary of Initial State and Conservation Rules\n\n*   **Initial NN State (`1S0`):**\n    *   Total Spin: `S(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum: `L(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Total Angular Momentum: `J(NN_i) = 0`\n    *   Parity: `P(NN_i) = (-1)^L(NN_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`\n\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity: `P(X) = -1`\n\n*   **Conservation Laws & Conditions:**\n    1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total initial angular momentum (`J(NN_i) = 0`) must equal the total final angular momentum. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J(NN_f)`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`L(X)`). For the total to be zero, we must have `J(NN_f) = L(X)`.\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the total final parity (`P_f`).\n        *   `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`\n        *   `P_f = (-1)^L(NN_f) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X)`\n        *   Therefore, `+1 = (-1) * (-1)^(L(NN_f) + L(X))`, which simplifies to the condition that the sum `L(NN_f) + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n    3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final NN State:** The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   With `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        *   This implies that the sum `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f)` must be **odd**.\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J(NN_f) = 1` and `L(X) = 1`. Condition `J(NN_f) = L(X)` is **met**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J(NN_f) = 1` and `L(X) = 1`. Condition `J(NN_f) = L(X)` is **met**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J(NN_f) = 3` and `L(X) = 3`. Condition `J(NN_f) = L(X)` is **met**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J(NN_f) = 0` and `L(X) = 0`. Condition `J(NN_f) = L(X)` is **met**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L(NN_f) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Condition is **met**.\n3.  **Pauli:** `S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that the sum must be odd.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.*\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
