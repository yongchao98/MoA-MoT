    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a closed volume to the net flux of the field through the surface that encloses the volume.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. We need to calculate ∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates gives zero for all r ≠ 0. However, the field has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where the divergence is undefined. This singularity acts as a source, and its presence means we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R. The differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, r = R, so the vector field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n\nNow, we compute the surface integral (the flux):\n\n∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∬ [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\n\nSince **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, and the R² terms cancel out, the integral simplifies to:\n\n∬ sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nWe integrate over the entire surface of the sphere, with θ ranging from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π:\n\n∫₀²π dφ ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ\n\nThe integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π.\nThe integral of sin(θ) from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n\nMultiplying these results gives:\n\n2π * 2 = 4π\n\nThis result is consistent with the fact that the divergence of this specific field is represented by 4π times the Dirac delta function at the origin, ∇ ⋅ (**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ³(**r**). The volume integral of this expression over any volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\nTherefore, the value of the volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π.\n\n<<<C>>>"
