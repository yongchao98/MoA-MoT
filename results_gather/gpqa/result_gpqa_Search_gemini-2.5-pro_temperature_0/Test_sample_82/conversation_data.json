    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The pKa is calculated from the given Ka value.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** To find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n    pH = pKa + log(\\[CH₃COO⁻] / \\[CH₃COOH])\n*   **Ratio of Base to Acid:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to the conjugate base, and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n    pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH Added:** First, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n    Moles of acid = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** The concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is:\n    \\[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We can now calculate the hydroxide ion concentration.\n    Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    x² = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
