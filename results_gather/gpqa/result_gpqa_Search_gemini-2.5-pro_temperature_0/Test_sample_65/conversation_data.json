    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parameterize potential new physics. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian is governed by fundamental symmetry principles.\n\nAll operators in the SMEFT must respect the following symmetries:\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT is a quantum field theory that is consistent with special relativity. Therefore, its Lagrangian, including all higher-dimensional operators, must be invariant under Poincaré transformations. The Poincaré group includes translations, rotations, and boosts (Lorentz transformations). Consequently, both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries must be preserved.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nOn the other hand, **CP symmetry** is not a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT. The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, and the SMEFT provides a framework to parameterize additional sources of CP violation from new physics at higher energy scales. There is extensive research dedicated to classifying and studying CP-violating operators within the SMEFT.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
