    "The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂) is an example of the halogenation of an enol. Enols are electron-rich alkenes and react rapidly with electrophiles like bromine.\n\nThe mechanism involves the following steps:\n1.  The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol tautomer. The double bond is between C1 and C2, with the hydroxyl group attached to C1.\n2.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the bromine molecule (Br₂). The lone pair on the oxygen atom can push electron density into the double bond, making the C2 carbon particularly nucleophilic.\n3.  This attack leads to the formation of a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in the corresponding ketone). In this case, the alpha-carbon is C2.\n4.  Simultaneously or in a subsequent step, the intermediate loses a proton from the hydroxyl group to reform the carbonyl double bond (C=O).\n\nThis process is known as alpha-halogenation. The overall result is the substitution of a hydrogen atom at the alpha-position with a bromine atom, yielding an α-bromoketone. The corresponding ketone is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, and the bromine adds to the C2 position.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n*   **A) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol** and **B) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol**: These would be the products of a standard electrophilic addition of Br₂ to an alkene, forming a dibromo alcohol. However, the enol functionality makes the alpha-halogenation pathway much more favorable.\n*   **D) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**: Bromination at the C4 position is not favored as the reactivity is centered around the enol's carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
