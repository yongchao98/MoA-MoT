    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition\n\nThe mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) or sulfur dioxide (SO₂).\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas did not react with a strong dehydrating agent, limewater, or hot copper, it is likely nitrogen gas (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n### 2. Verify the composition and identify the salts\n\nLet's summarize the decomposition products:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂)\n\nLet's check the total mass of these products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass is exactly equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture, which confirms our identification of the products and their quantities. The original salts must therefore be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n\nThe production of N₂, H₂O, and O₂ upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of certain ammonium salts. The most common salts that fit this profile are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's assume:\n*   Salt A is **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **\n*   Salt B is **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n1.  NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)\n2.  2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of each salt.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₂ = x\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = x\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reactions, we can calculate the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total H₂O:** (2 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (4/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** 0 from NH₄NO₂ + (1/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = 0.5x\n*   **Total N₂:** (1 * x) from NH₄NO₂ + (2/2 * x) from NH₄NO₃ = x + x = 2x\n\nNow, we can use the moles of products we calculated earlier to find 'x':\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol  => x = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our calculation).\n*   From N₂: 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This also matches).\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. Let's also verify the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g.\nThis is consistent with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total number of atoms\n\nThe salts have been correctly identified as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
