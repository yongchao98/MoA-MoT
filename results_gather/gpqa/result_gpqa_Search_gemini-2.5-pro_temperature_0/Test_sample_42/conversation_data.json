    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, a systematic approach is required, following the official nomenclature rules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound:** The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom to which the carboxylic acid is attached is designated as position 1 (C1).\n\n2.  **Identify and Place the Substituents:**\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl group) and Cyano (-CN, nitrile group):** These are both *meta* to the carboxylic acid, meaning they are at positions 3 and 5. They are also *meta* to each other, which is consistent with being at C3 and C5.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH₃):** This is *para* to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH, alcohol) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂):** These are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid, meaning they are at positions 2 and 6.\n    *   **Final Placement using a Key Constraint:** The problem states that the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both *ortho* to the cyano group. This is the crucial piece of information to distinguish between two possible structures.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Two Possible Structures:**\n    *   **Scenario 1: Cyano group at C5.** For the hydroxyl group to be *ortho* to the cyano group at C5, it must be at C4 or C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This forces the dimethylamino group into the remaining *ortho* position, C2. The carbaldehyde group is at C3. This structure has substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n    *   **Scenario 2: Cyano group at C3.** For the hydroxyl group to be *ortho* to the cyano group at C3, it must be at C2 or C4. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This forces the dimethylamino group into the remaining *ortho* position, C6. The carbaldehyde group is at C5. This structure also has substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n4.  **Apply the IUPAC Tie-Breaking Rule:**\n    Since both possible structures result in the same set of locants (positions) for the substituents {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, a tie-breaking rule is needed. According to IUPAC nomenclature, if the locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   First, list the substituents alphabetically: **cyano**, **dimethylamino**, **formyl**, **hydroxy**, **methoxy**.\n    *   The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\".\n    *   In Scenario 1, the cyano group is at position 5.\n    *   In Scenario 2, the cyano group is at position 3.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, Scenario 2 is the correctly numbered structure.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final Name:**\n    Based on the correct structure (Scenario 2), the substituents are located as follows:\n    *   Position 2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   Position 3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   Position 4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   Position 5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   Position 6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n    The final name is constructed by listing these substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its position number.\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\n    Combining these gives the full IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
