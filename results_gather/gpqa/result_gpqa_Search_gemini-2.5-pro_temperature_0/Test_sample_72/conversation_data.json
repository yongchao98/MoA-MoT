    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) of astronaut 1 as observed by astronaut 2 is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30c² / c²)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)\nv_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total energy (E) of the system\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where 'm' is the rest mass, 'c' is the speed of light, and 'γ' is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass m1 = 2m, velocity v1 = 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ1 = 1 / √0.64\nγ1 = 1 / 0.8\nγ1 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E1):\nE1 = γ1 * m1 * c²\nE1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass m2 = 3m, velocity v2 = 0.5c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ2 = 1 / √0.75\nγ2 = 1 / (√3 / 2)\nγ2 = 2 / √3\nγ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E2):\nE2 = γ2 * m2 * c²\nE2 = (2 / √3) * (3m) * c²\nE2 = (6 / √3) * mc²\nE2 = 2√3 mc²\nE2 ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 3.464) mc²\n**E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**. Comparing these results with the given options:\n\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
