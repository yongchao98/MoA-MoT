    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Wild-Type Function:** The transcription factor subunit must dimerize (pair up with another subunit) to become active, enter the nucleus, and regulate gene transcription.\n\n2.  **Defining \"Dominant-Negative\":** A dominant-negative mutation produces a faulty protein that not only is non-functional itself but also actively interferes with the function of the normal, wild-type protein produced from the other allele. This is different from a recessive mutation, where the presence of one good copy of the gene is enough for normal function (a state called haplosufficiency).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Mutation Y:**\n    *   The mutation is in the **dimerization domain**. This is a critical clue.\n    *   The protein is **heterozygous**, meaning the cell produces both normal (wild-type) and mutant (Y) protein subunits.\n    *   Because the mutation is dominant-negative and located in the dimerization domain, the mutant Y protein can still form a dimer with a wild-type protein. However, this resulting \"mixed\" dimer (wild-type + Y) is non-functional.\n    *   This process effectively \"poisons\" or sequesters the wild-type protein, preventing it from forming functional wild-type/wild-type dimers. This interference with the wild-type protein is the key to the dominant-negative effect.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype: This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a mutant, not a wild-type, phenotype. Also, dimerization still occurs, but it forms non-functional pairs.\n    *   B) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype: This is incorrect. The scenario describes a dominant-*negative* effect, which is a type of loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function where the protein would gain a new or enhanced activity.\n    *   C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype: While possible in some diseases, aggregation is not the most direct or universal mechanism for a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein. The primary mechanism is the formation of non-functional mixed dimers.\n    *   D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele: This is the most likely phenotype. The mutant Y protein interferes with the wild-type protein by forming a non-functional complex. This leads to a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" because its protein product is rendered useless. Cellular quality control mechanisms often recognize such abnormal protein complexes and target them for degradation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
