    "This problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, a process that is fundamentally \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nTo solve this, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability that a single nucleus will decay per unit of time. The probability `P` that an atom will decay within a time `t` is given by the formula for exponential decay:\n\n*P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find λ:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nNow, we can solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNow we can use this decay constant to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. As mentioned, due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)*\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))*\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))*\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5*\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n\n0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we find the probability:\n\n*P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393*\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%, is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
