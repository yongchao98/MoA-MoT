    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we can systematically deduce its structure from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₆) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C₆H₄. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms this with two signals for aromatic hydrogens, suggesting a symmetrical substitution pattern like a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This tells us the compound contains a -COO- functional group, which accounts for one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the C₆H₄ group. (4 hydrogens)\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment adds C₃H₅ to the molecule (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ group signals:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH₃` group identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, it cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃). Therefore, it must be either a methyl ester (–COOCH₃) or an acetate group (CH₃COO–). Both possibilities add a CH₃ group. (3 hydrogens)\n    *   **No –CH₂ group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate other possibilities.\n\n### Assembling the Structure and Determining the Formula\n\nLet's assemble the identified fragments to build the molecule and calculate its formula:\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄ (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens)\n*   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens)\n*   **Ester Group:** This group has two possible connectivities, but both lead to the same formula.\n    *   **Case 1: Methyl ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-COOCH₃`. The `-COOCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n    *   **Case 2: Acetate ester:** The substituents on the ring are `-CH=CH-CH₃` and `-OOCCH₃`. The `-OOCCH₃` fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three hydrogens, two oxygens).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms for the entire molecule:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 6 (one ring, four double bonds: three in the ring, one vinyl, and one carbonyl), which is consistent with the proposed structure. The other options can be ruled out as they do not match the atom count derived from the detailed NMR analysis, particularly the constraint of having no -CH₂- groups.\n\n<<<C>>>"
