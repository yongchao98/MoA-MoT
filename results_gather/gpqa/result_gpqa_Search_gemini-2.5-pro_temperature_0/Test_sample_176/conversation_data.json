    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We can set up a ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law and account for the Doppler effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law**: This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength (λ_rest) of its emitted light in its own rest frame: λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means T = b/λ_rest.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is shifted due to the star's radial velocity (v). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where 'c' is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n5.  **Applying the Information**:\n    *   The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Its observed wavelength is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we have: λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂(1 + v₂/c).\n\n6.  **Connecting to Temperature**: Now we substitute Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) into the equation from the previous step:\n    b/T₁ = (b/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    By simplifying, we can find the ratio of the temperatures:\n    1/T₁ = (1/T₂)(1 + v₂/c)\n    T₂/T₁ = 1 + v₂/c\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculation**: Now, we plug in the values for the velocity of Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s) and the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    *   v₂/c = 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s ≈ 0.002333\n    *   T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 0.99767\n    *   (T₁/T₂)⁴ ≈ (0.99767)⁴ ≈ 0.9907\n\n8.  **Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation**: Finally, we substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9907\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
