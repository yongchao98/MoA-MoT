    "The search results confirm the formulas and constants used in the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the population of two energy levels (N2 and N1) is given by N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T)). Since the statistical weights (g1, g2) are constant for the specific transition, they cancel out when we take the ratio of the population ratios at two different temperatures.\n*   **Photon Energy:** The energy difference between the two levels (ΔE = E2 - E1) is related to the wavelength (λ) of the transition by the formula ΔE = h * c / λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light.\n*   **Physical Constants:** The values for the Planck constant (h), the speed of light (c), and the Boltzmann constant (k) are confirmed by multiple sources.\n\nThe calculation steps remain the same:\n\n1.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):**\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m\n    *   ΔE = (h * c) / λ = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ * 3.0 x 10⁸) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n2.  **Calculate the term ΔE/k:**\n    *   k ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   ΔE / k = (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99420 K\n\n3.  **Define the population ratios:**\n    *   Let R be the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) to the lower energy level (level 1).\n    *   Ratio without spots (T₁ = 6000 K): R_nospots ∝ exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   Ratio with spots (T₂ = 5500 K): R_spots ∝ exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    *   The problem states the ratio decreases when spots are present (i.e., at the lower temperature), which is consistent with this definition (R_spots < R_nospots).\n\n4.  **Calculate the factor of change:**\n    *   The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots,\" which is R_nospots / R_spots.\n    *   Factor = R_nospots / R_spots = exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n    *   Factor = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂)]\n    *   Factor = exp[99420 * (1/5500 - 1/6000)]\n    *   Factor = exp[99420 * ((6000 - 5500) / (6000 * 5500))]\n    *   Factor = exp[99420 * (500 / 33,000,000)]\n    *   Factor = exp(1.506)\n    *   Factor ≈ 4.508\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~2.9\nB) ~1.1\nC) ~7.8\nD) ~4.5\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe energy difference ΔE can be calculated from the wavelength (λ) of the transition using the formula for the energy of a photon:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant (≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m).\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy difference ΔE and the value of ΔE/k:\nΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\nΔE / k = (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99490 K\n\nNow, let's denote the ratio (N₂/N₁) as R. We have two temperatures:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nThe corresponding ratios are:\n*   R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * 6000))\n*   R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * 5500))\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio R_nospots / R_spots.\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*6000)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k*5500)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out.\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99490 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99490 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp(1.507)\nFactor ≈ 4.51\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
