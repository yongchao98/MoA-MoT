    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified by breaking down the information from each spectrum and comparing it with the proposed structures.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation of the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, point to a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂):** Matches.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester. This is consistent with the observed N-H and C=O stretches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethoxy group, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. This perfectly matches all the observed signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. While the formula matches, the NMR would show a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet at much higher field, ~1.1 and ~2.5 ppm respectively) instead of an ethoxy group. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a primary amide (-CONH₂) and meta-substitution. The IR carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-). It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two. The NMR would show a signal for only one amide proton, not two, and would also feature a very downfield formyl proton (H-C=O) signal. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data—molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR—are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
