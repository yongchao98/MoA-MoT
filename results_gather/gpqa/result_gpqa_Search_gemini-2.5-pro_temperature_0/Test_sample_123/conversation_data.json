    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### 1. Understanding Relativistic Particle Decay\n\nThe fraction of unstable particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the principles of special relativity and exponential decay. Due to time dilation, a particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time slower than an observer in a stationary reference frame (like the detector).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, is:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles that reach the detector.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t_lab` is the time taken to reach the detector wall in the lab's frame of reference.\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `τ` (tau) is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\n\nThe particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `L` (30 m) is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n\nSo, the survival fraction formula can be written as:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `k = L / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`ln(N/N₀) = -k / γ`\n`γ = -k / ln(N/N₀)`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Conditions\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₁` = 1/3\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₂` = 2/3\n\nWe can set up a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `k`:\n\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = [-k / ln((N/N₀)₂)] / [-k / ln((N/N₀)₁)]`\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = ln((N/N₀)₁) / ln((N/N₀)₂)`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * [ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)]`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`), we can simplify the expression:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3))]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))]`\n\nNow, we use the known values for the natural logarithms of 2 and 3:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.6931\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis result is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
