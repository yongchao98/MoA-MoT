    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two main factors: the star's visibility from each observatory's location and its apparent brightness.\n\n### 1. Observability Conditions\n\n*   **Magnitude Limits:** A star must be bright enough for each instrument.\n    *   ESPRESSO requires an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n    *   HIRES requires an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 16 (V < 16).\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be observed by **both**, it must satisfy the stricter condition: **V < 16**.\n\n*   **Location and Visibility:** A star must be visible in the sky from both observatories.\n    *   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located in Chile at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees. It can observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere and a significant portion of the northern one.\n    *   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in Hawaii at a latitude of about +19.8 degrees. It can observe the entire northern celestial hemisphere and a portion of the southern one.\n    *   For a star to be visible from both, its declination (DEC) must be within a range accessible to both Northern and Southern Hemisphere observatories. A declination between approximately -70 and +66 degrees is generally considered observable from these latitudes.\n\n### 2. Star Analysis\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) of a star is calculated from its absolute magnitude (M), distance (d) in parsecs, and the absorption due to interstellar dust (A_V) using the formula: m = M + 5*log₁₀(d/10) + A_V.\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This is too far south to be visible from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +55°. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5. This is too faint for HIRES (16.5 is not < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. This is bright enough for both ESPRESSO (15.5 < 17) and HIRES (15.5 < 16). The additional information about color excess is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is provided.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 15.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n        *   Absorption (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   Apparent V mag (m) = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This is too faint for HIRES (16.74 is not < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   Absolute V magnitude (M) = 16.5 mag\n        *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n        *   Apparent V mag (m) = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is bright enough for both ESPRESSO (14.995 < 17) and HIRES (14.995 < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<A>>>"
