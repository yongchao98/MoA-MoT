    "The final product of the reaction sequence is identified by first determining the structure of the starting material and then analyzing the subsequent reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting compound is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 units) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group).\n\nThe 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the aldehyde region. The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This corresponds to a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts suggest the presence of an electron-donating group.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the -CH2- group that is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with both the molecular formula and all the NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate formed is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle heating, results in the hydrolysis of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This addition reaction forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a proton from the α-carbon are removed, creating a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration step is generally favorable as it leads to a conjugated system. The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is the final, stable product of the aldol condensation reaction under heating.\n\nComparing this structure to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - Matches the predicted final product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
