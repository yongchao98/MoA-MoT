    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects and directing properties:\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the benzene ring, increasing its reactivity towards electrophiles and directing substitution to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density (deactivating the ring) but still direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring, making it much less reactive and directing substitution to the meta position. Consequently, they produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Ordering the Substances**\n\nThe substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer, while those with ortho/para-directing groups will have the highest.\n\n#### **1. Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2), the major product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the para-isomer is minimal. The order among these is determined by the strength of the deactivating effect.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para product (around 0-5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6):** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating. The para-isomer yield is very low, typically around 1-2%.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** The ester group is a strong deactivator, similar to a carboxylic acid. Data for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) shows about 5% para-product, which is slightly higher than for the other meta-directors.\n\nBased on the deactivating strength and typical isomer distributions, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n#### **2. Ortho/Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the major products are the ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is determined primarily by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. Conventional bromination of toluene yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and 60-70% para-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For example, in mercuration, the para-product percentage increases from 79.2% for toluene to 83.2% for ethylbenzene. A similar trend is expected for bromination.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho/para-director. While deactivating, it gives a very high yield of the para-isomer upon bromination, around 89%.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
