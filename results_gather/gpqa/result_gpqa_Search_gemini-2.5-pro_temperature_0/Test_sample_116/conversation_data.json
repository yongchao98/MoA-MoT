    "Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6,6' and 2,2' respectively), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as its mirror images are non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a carbon atom (the second carbon of the propanoate chain) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Because it is not bonded to four different groups and possesses a plane of symmetry, it is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism. While benzophenone is achiral, it can be used to create chiral derivatives or can crystallize in a chiral form.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
