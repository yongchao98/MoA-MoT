    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of the buffer components:**\n\n*   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n*   In solution, KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻).\n*   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺, the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻), and water.\n*   The key buffer pair is the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n\n*   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the buffer solution:**\n\n*   The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair.\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n*   We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n    *   pH = pKa₂ + log ( [HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻] )\n    *   pKa₂ = -log(Ka₂) = -log(6.2x10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.208\n    *   pH = 7.208 + log ( 0.02809 / 0.03674 )\n    *   pH = 7.208 + log(0.7646)\n    *   pH = 7.208 - 0.117\n    *   pH ≈ 7.091\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻):**\n\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n*   We can write the equilibrium expression for Ka₃:\n    *   Ka₃ = ( [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] ) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   First, we find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] from the pH:\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻⁷.⁰⁹¹ ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n*   Now, we rearrange the Ka₃ expression to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ( [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺] )\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * ( 0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ )\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
