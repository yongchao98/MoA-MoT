    "To determine the correct statement, each of the four options must be evaluated based on established principles and practices in industrial polymer chemistry. The scenario involves creating a branched polyethylene from only ethylene, which requires a dual-catalyst system: one catalyst for polymerization and a second for oligomerization of ethylene into α-olefins (e.g., 1-hexene, 1-octene), which are then incorporated as branches.\n\n*   **A) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This is correct. Chromium (Cr), a Group VIa (or Group 6) transition metal, is the basis for highly selective catalysts used in the trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene to produce 1-hexene and 1-octene, respectively. These are the precise comonomers needed to introduce regular, short-chain branches. The Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, for example, uses a chromium-based system for the industrial production of 1-hexene.\n\n*   **B) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is also correct. Catalysts based on late transition metals, including noble metals like palladium (Pd), are known to catalyze ethylene oligomerization and polymerization. However, the high cost and lower abundance of noble metals compared to elements like chromium or titanium make them economically unviable for the production of high-volume, commodity polymers like polyethylene. Their use is generally limited to academic research or the production of low-volume, high-value specialty chemicals.\n\n*   **C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This statement is incorrect. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene. Many successful chromium-based oligomerization catalyst systems are activated by aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), triethylaluminum (TEA), or triisobutylaluminum (TIBA). Research shows that not only do aluminum activators work, but their specific type and concentration are crucial for optimizing catalyst activity and selectivity.\n\n*   **D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This is correct. Technologies that use dual-catalyst systems or advanced single catalysts with multiple functionalities in a single reactor are commercially implemented. For instance, Univation Technologies, a US-based joint venture, has commercialized its PRODIGY™ Bimodal HDPE Technology, which can produce advanced polyethylene grades in a single reactor using multi-component catalyst systems. These processes are used in industrial plants in the US and globally.\n\nSince statements A, B, and D are all factually correct, there may be an issue with the question's premise of having only one correct answer. However, if forced to choose the best statement, one must consider the context. Statement B provides a complete and self-contained piece of techno-economic advice that is broadly true in catalysis: a certain class of materials is technically feasible but economically impractical for this specific application. It highlights a key constraint in industrial chemistry. Statements A and D are also correct but describe a specific viable technology and its implementation status. In many contexts, a statement that balances technical possibility with economic reality, like B, is considered a robust and complete piece of analysis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
