    "The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in a far-field diffraction pattern. The aperture is an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and the number of sides, N, is infinitely large.\n\nFirst, we must determine the shape of the aperture as N approaches infinity. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the angular distance between the first two minima of a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by:\nsin(θ) = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nFor a circular aperture of radius 'a', the diameter D = 2a. The angular positions of the first and second minima are well-established.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is given by:\nsin(θ₁) ≈ θ₁ = 1.220 * λ / D = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is given by:\nsin(θ₂) ≈ θ₂ = 2.233 * λ / D = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two)\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a (This is related to the diameter, not the radius, for the first minimum)\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
