    "The observed peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths, is characteristic of a Lyman-alpha break in the spectrum of a high-redshift quasar. The Lyman-alpha transition in hydrogen has a rest-frame wavelength of 121.6 nm. The observed wavelength is stretched due to the expansion of the universe, an effect known as redshift (z).\n\nThe redshift can be calculated using the formula:\n\n*   z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n*   z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n*   z ≈ 6.50 - 1\n*   z ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the redshift determined, the comoving distance to the quasar can be calculated using the parameters of the specified Lambda-CDM cosmological model:\n\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter Density Parameter (Ω_m):** 0.3\n*   **Dark Energy Density Parameter (Ω_Λ):** 0.7\n*   **Curvature:** Flat (Ω_k = 0)\n\nThe comoving distance (D_c) is calculated by integrating the Friedmann equation. For a flat universe, the formula is:\n\nD_c = (c / H₀) \\* ∫ [from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ)\n\nUsing a cosmology calculator with the values z = 5.5, H₀ = 70, Ω_m = 0.3, and Ω_Λ = 0.7, the comoving distance is found to be approximately 8 Gpc.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable assumption for the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth is 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<B>>>"
