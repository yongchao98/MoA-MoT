    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how they are affected by the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch. The 8.5-minute time delay mentioned corresponds to the travel time of neutrinos from the Sun to Earth, meaning the effects of this shutdown are observable now.\n\n### Neutrino Sources by Energy Band\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   **⁸B (Boron-8) neutrinos:** The pp-III branch produces ⁸B, which then decays, emitting neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. A portion of this spectrum falls within the 700-800 keV range.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** The CNO cycle produces neutrinos from the decay of ¹³N (up to 1.20 MeV) and ¹⁵O (up to 1.73 MeV), which also contribute to this band.\n    *   Other sources like pp and pep neutrinos fall outside this energy range.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   **⁷Be (Beryllium-7) neutrinos:** The pp-II branch involves the electron capture of ⁷Be, which produces a very strong, distinct neutrino line at approximately 861 keV. This is the dominant source in this band.\n    *   **⁸B (Boron-8) neutrinos:** A portion of the continuous ⁸B spectrum also falls in this range.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Neutrinos from the CNO cycle also contribute to this band.\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch stops. The defining feature of the pp-III branch is the production of ⁸B. Therefore, the flux of all ⁸B neutrinos ceases. All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycles, continue as normal.\n\nAfter the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino sources in each band are:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The only remaining source is the CNO cycle neutrinos.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The remaining sources are the very strong ⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV (from the pp-II branch) and the CNO cycle neutrinos.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nThe ratio we need to find is:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) = (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from ⁷Be + Flux from CNO)\n\nThe key to solving this is comparing the magnitudes of the ⁷Be flux and the CNO flux.\n\n1.  **⁷Be Flux:** The ⁷Be reaction produces one of the most significant neutrino fluxes after the primary pp reaction, with most of its neutrinos concentrated in the sharp line at 861 keV.\n2.  **CNO Flux:** The CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's total energy output. Its corresponding neutrino flux is significantly lower than that from the main pp-chain branches like pp-II (which produces the ⁷Be neutrinos).\n\nThe flux from the ⁷Be line is roughly two orders of magnitude (about 100 times) greater than the CNO flux within a comparable energy window.\n\nTherefore, the flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the ⁷Be neutrinos. The equation for the ratio simplifies to:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (small CNO flux) / (large ⁷Be flux)\n\nThis ratio is approximately 1/100, or 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
