    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate its mole fraction among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe formation of each complex is defined by its overall stability constant (β):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the mole fraction (α₂) is:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the concentrations of all species, we can derive a formula for the mole fraction that depends only on the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe problem states the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, assuming the provided [SCN⁻] is the equilibrium concentration.\n\nNow, we can calculate the terms in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\nSum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
