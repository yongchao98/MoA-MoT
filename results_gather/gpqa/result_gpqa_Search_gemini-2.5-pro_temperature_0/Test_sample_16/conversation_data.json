    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Dissociation Reaction:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻, dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (EDTA⁴⁻) according to the following equilibrium reaction:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**2. Equilibrium Constants:**\nThe problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the complex, which represents the equilibrium for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻).\n*   K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰\n\nTo analyze the dissociation, we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n*   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant is:\n*   K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n**3. Equilibrium Calculation:**\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species        | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_d expression:\n*   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n**4. Solving for x:**\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small. This means the complex is very stable and will dissociate very little. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n*   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺:\n*   x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n*   x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n*   x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n*   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
