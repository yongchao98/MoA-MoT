    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Reactant and Potential Abstraction Sites:** The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The bromine is at the C1 position, and a deuterium atom is at the C2 position. The positions ortho to the bromine are C2 (which has a deuterium, D) and C6 (which has a hydrogen, H).\n\n2.  **Kinetic Isotope Effect:** The carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond. Consequently, the amide base will abstract the proton from the C6 position more readily than the deuteron from the C2 position. This phenomenon is known as a primary kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n3.  **Pathway 1: Abstraction of Hydrogen (Major Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C6.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C6, which then eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion (NH2-) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond:\n        *   **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (m-deuterioaniline) after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (o-deuterioaniline) after protonation.\n\n4.  **Pathway 2: Abstraction of Deuterium (Minor Pathway):**\n    *   The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect but still occurs.\n    *   This creates a carbanion at C2, which eliminates the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   In this process, the deuterium is removed. The intermediate is a non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   The nucleophilic amide ion attacks this benzyne, which, after protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nSince both pathways are possible, three distinct organic products can be formed from the reaction.\n\nThe possible products are:\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
