    "To solve this problem, we must calculate the total heat released during the chemical reactions. This involves two main processes: the neutralization of acids with a base and the potential precipitation of an insoluble salt.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Moles of Reactants\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acids and hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from the base.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.500 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid and monoprotic (provides one H⁺ ion), moles of H⁺ = 0.10 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is a strong acid and diprotic (provides two H⁺ ions), moles of H⁺ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol (from HCl) + 0.18 mol (from H₂SO₄) = 0.28 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.200 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and provides two OH⁻ ions, moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n### 2. Enthalpy of Neutralization\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\nWe compare the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol) and OH⁻ (0.20 mol) to find the limiting reactant. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is the limiting reactant, as there are fewer moles of it. Therefore, the reaction will consume all 0.20 moles of OH⁻, and 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol (or -57.1 kJ/mol). This is the heat released when one mole of water is formed.\n\n*   **Heat released from neutralization (ΔH_neut):**\n    *   ΔH_neut = Moles of water formed × Enthalpy of neutralization per mole\n    *   ΔH_neut = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n### 3. Consideration of Precipitation\n\nThe mixture also contains barium ions (Ba²⁺) from Ba(OH)₂ and sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from H₂SO₄. These ions react to form a precipitate of barium sulfate (BaSO₄).\n\n*   Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\nThis precipitation reaction also releases heat. However, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization.\" In many contexts, this term refers strictly to the heat evolved from the H⁺ and OH⁻ reaction. Given the provided options, it is most likely that only the heat from the neutralization reaction is expected.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Answer\n\nThe calculated heat of neutralization is -2.74 kcal. Let's compare this to the given options:\n*   A) -16.0 kJ\n*   B) -2.72 kcal\n*   C) -3.80 kcal\n*   D) -11.42 kcal\n\nThe calculated value of -2.74 kcal is extremely close to option B, -2.72 kcal. The minor difference can be attributed to using a slightly different value for the standard enthalpy of neutralization (e.g., -13.6 kcal/mol vs. -13.7 kcal/mol).\n\nIf we convert our result to kJ: -2.74 kcal × 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ -11.46 kJ. This does not match option A. Option D is -11.42 *kcal*, not kJ, which is a significantly different amount of energy.\n\nTherefore, the calculation based solely on the enthalpy of neutralization provides the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
