  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\nThe sequence begins with `5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC...`.\n*   `ATG` is the universal start codon, coding for Methionine.\n*   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` is the DNA sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The corresponding amino acid sequence is Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartate-Valine-Proline-Aspartate-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). This confirms the antigenic determinant sequence is present and correct, which rules out option D.\n\nThe sequence immediately following the HA tag is `AAA TGA`.\n*   `AAA` codes for the amino acid Lysine.\n*   `TGA` is one of the three universal stop codons (along with TAA and TAG).\n\nThe presence of a `TGA` stop codon immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single lysine will signal the ribosome to halt protein synthesis. This results in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide (Met-HA-Lys) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. Therefore, the ribosome terminates the translation process prematurely.\n\nThis analysis invalidates the other options:\n*   A) While a linker sequence can sometimes be important, the primary issue here is the premature termination of translation, not proteolysis.\n*   B) The problematic codon is TGA, not UAA. Furthermore, tRNAs do not exist for any stop codon; instead, release factors bind to the ribosome to terminate translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
