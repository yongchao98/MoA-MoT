    "The user wants to find the total energy of a specific Lithium nucleus moving at a relativistic speed.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the steps and the information gathered:\n\n1.  **Identify the nucleus X**: The problem states X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3 (meaning 3 protons). Therefore, the mass number A is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. The nucleus is ⁶Li.\n\n2.  **Find the rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus**:\n    *   From the search results, the mass of a **Lithium-6 atom** is 6.015122 amu. This is the mass of the atom, which includes 3 electrons. To get the nuclear mass, I must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons.\n    *   Mass of an electron = 0.00054858 amu (from a new search, or known constant).\n    *   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 amu = 0.00164574 amu.\n    *   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus (m₀) = 6.015122 amu - 0.00164574 amu = 6.01347626 amu.\n\n3.  **Convert the rest mass to energy (GeV/c²)**:\n    *   The conversion factor is 1 amu = 931.4941 MeV/c² = 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n    *   Rest mass in GeV/c² = 6.01347626 amu * 0.9314941 GeV/c²/amu.\n    *   m₀ = 5.60151 GeV/c².\n    *   Therefore, the rest energy E₀ = 5.60151 GeV.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**:\n    *   The speed v = 0.96c.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy (E)**:\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   E = 3.57142857 * 5.60151 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.0054 GeV\n\nLet me re-evaluate the calculation with higher precision.\n\n*   Mass of ⁶Li atom = 6.015122 u\n*   Mass of electron = 0.0005485799 u\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.0005485799 u = 0.0016457397 u\n*   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus = 6.015122 u - 0.0016457397 u = 6.0134762603 u\n*   1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c²\n*   Rest energy E₀ = 6.0134762603 u * 931.4941 MeV/u = 5601.513 MeV = 5.601513 GeV\n*   Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... (or 25/7)\n*   Total Energy E = γ * E₀ = (25/7) * 5.601513 GeV\n*   E = 20.00540357 GeV\n\nThis value (20.0054 GeV) is very close to option B (20.132 GeV). Let me check if there's an alternative way to calculate the mass, for instance, by summing the masses of protons and neutrons and subtracting the binding energy.\n\n*   Mass of proton = 1.00727647 amu\n*   Mass of neutron = 1.0086649 amu\n*   Mass of 3 protons = 3 * 1.00727647 = 3.02182941 amu\n*   Mass of 3 neutrons = 3 * 1.0086649 = 3.0259947 amu\n*   Total mass of constituents = 3.02182941 + 3.0259947 = 6.04782411 amu\n*   The mass of the ⁶Li nucleus is 6.01347626 amu.\n*   Mass defect = 6.04782411 - 6.01347626 = 0.03434785 amu\n*   Binding energy = 0.03434785 amu * 931.4941 MeV/amu = 32.000 MeV\n\nThis confirms the previous calculation of the nuclear mass is correct. Let's re-check the calculation.\n\nE = (25/7) * 5.601513 GeV = 20.0054 GeV.\n\nThis is not matching any of the options well. Let me re-read the question. \"What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\". This might be interpreted differently. Is it asking for the energy *per nucleon*?\n\nLet's calculate the energy per nucleon.\n*   Total Energy E = 20.0054 GeV\n*   Number of nucleons A = 6\n*   Energy per nucleon = E / A = 20.0054 GeV / 6 = 3.3342 GeV/nucleon.\n\nThis doesn't match the options either.\n\nLet's reconsider the mass. What if the question implies using the mass of the constituents directly, without considering binding energy? This is physically incorrect, but might be a simplification for the problem.\n*   Mass of constituents = 6.04782411 amu\n*   Rest energy E₀ = 6.04782411 amu * 0.9314941 GeV/amu = 5.63339 GeV\n*   Total Energy E = γ * E₀ = (25/7) * 5.63339 GeV = 20.119 GeV\n\nThis value, 20.119 GeV, is very close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The small difference might come from slightly different values for the proton/neutron masses.\n\nLet's try another approach. What if the mass number A is used as an approximation for the mass in amu?\n*   m₀ ≈ 6 u\n*   E₀ ≈ 6 u * 0.9314941 GeV/u = 5.58896 GeV\n*   E = γ * E₀ = (25/7) * 5.58896 GeV = 19.96 GeV. Still close to 20.\n\nLet's re-examine the calculation using the sum of proton and neutron masses.\n*   Mass of proton: 938.272 MeV/c²\n*   Mass of neutron: 939.565 MeV/c²\n*   Rest energy of constituents = 3 * 938.272 MeV + 3 * 939.565 MeV\n*   = 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.\n*   Total Energy E = γ * E₀ = (25/7) * 5.633511 GeV = 20.11968 GeV.\n\nThis result (20.11968 GeV) is extremely close to option B (20.132 GeV). The minor discrepancy (0.012 GeV) could be due to rounding in the provided options or the constants used. Given the choices, this seems to be the intended method. The problem likely ignores the binding energy for simplification.\n\nLet's assume the calculation based on the sum of the masses of the constituent nucleons is the correct one.\n\n**Final Calculation Steps:**\n1.  **Identify Nucleus**: Lithium with 3 neutrons is ⁶Li (3 protons, 3 neutrons).\n2.  **Calculate Rest Energy (E₀)**: Sum the rest energies of the individual nucleons.\n    *   Rest energy of 3 protons = 3 * 938.272 MeV = 2814.816 MeV.\n    *   Rest energy of 3 neutrons = 3 * 939.565 MeV = 2818.695 MeV.\n    *   Total rest energy E₀ = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.\n3.  **Calculate Lorentz Factor (γ)**:\n    *   v = 0.96c\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.\n4.  **Calculate Total Energy (E)**:\n    *   E = γ * E₀ = (25/7) * 5.633511 GeV ≈ 20.1197 GeV.\n\nThis value is closest to 20.132 GeV.\n\nLet's check the precision requirement: 1e-4.\nMy calculated value: 20.1197 GeV\nOption B: 20.132 GeV\nDifference: |20.1197 - 20.132| = 0.0123 GeV.\nThis difference is larger than the requested precision. Let me check the constants again.\n\nMaybe the question is about the energy *per nucleon pair* or something specific to the RHIC collider. RHIC collides heavy ions. The energy is often quoted per nucleon pair.\nLet's calculate the kinetic energy.\n*   Kinetic Energy (KE) = (γ - 1) * E₀\n*   KE = (25/7 - 1) * 5.633511 GeV = (18/7) * 5.633511 GeV ≈ 14.486 GeV. This is not among the options.\n\nThe question asks for \"the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\". This usually refers to the total energy of the accelerated particle.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the mass of ⁶Li.\n*   Atomic mass of ⁶Li is 6.015122 u.\n*   This is the mass of the atom (nucleus + electrons). In an accelerator, the atoms are ionized, so we should use the nuclear mass.\n*   Nuclear mass m_nuc = m_atom - Z*m_e + B_e/c²\n*   The electron binding energy B_e is very small and can be neglected.\n*   m_nuc ≈ m_atom - Z*m_e\n*   m_e = 0.511 MeV/c²\n*   m_atom(⁶Li) = 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u = 5602.93 MeV\n*   m_nuc ≈ 5602.93 MeV - 3 * 0.511 MeV = 5602.93 - 1.533 = 5601.397 MeV = 5.601397 GeV.\n*   E = γ * E₀ = (25/7) * 5.601397 GeV = 20.0049 GeV.\n\nThis result, 20.005 GeV, is still not matching any option well. It's closest to 20.132 GeV, but the difference is ~0.127 GeV.\n\nLet's reconsider the interpretation. What if the mass of the nucleus is simply approximated as A * m_p?\n*   m₀ ≈ 6 * 938.272 MeV = 5629.632 MeV = 5.629632 GeV\n*   E = (25/7) * 5.629632 GeV = 20.1058 GeV.\nThis is also very close to 20.1197 GeV and option B.\n\nWhat if it's A * m_u?\n*   m₀ ≈ 6 * 931.494 MeV = 5588.964 MeV = 5.588964 GeV\n*   E = (25/7) * 5.588964 GeV = 19.960 GeV.\n\nIt seems the most plausible method that yields a result close to one of the options is to sum the rest masses of the constituent protons and neutrons, ignoring the binding energy.\nE = 20.1197 GeV.\nClosest option is B: 20.132 GeV.\nDifference = 0.13%. This is a small difference, likely attributable to the specific values of constants used in setting the problem.\n\nLet's assume option B is correct and work backwards.\n*   E = 20.132 GeV\n*   γ = 25/7\n*   E₀ = E / γ = 20.132 / (25/7) = 20.132 * 7 / 25 = 5.63696 GeV = 5636.96 MeV.\n*   This required rest energy (5636.96 MeV) needs to be compared with our calculated rest energy (5633.511 MeV from summing nucleons, or 5601.4 MeV using the actual nuclear mass).\n*   The required rest energy (5636.96 MeV) is very close to the sum of constituent nucleon masses (5633.511 MeV). The difference is 3.45 MeV, or about 0.06%.\n\nThis confirms that the intended method was likely to sum the rest masses of the protons and neutrons. The small discrepancy can be attributed to the use of slightly different mass constants for the proton and neutron. For example, if slightly higher mass values were used for the proton and neutron, the result would match option B.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation based on the sum of nucleon masses.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  **Nucleus Identification**: The nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li), which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n2.  **Rest Mass Calculation**: The rest mass of the nucleus is approximated by the sum of the rest masses of its constituent nucleons.\n    *   Rest mass of a proton (m_p) ≈ 938.272 MeV/c².\n    *   Rest mass of a neutron (m_n) ≈ 939.565 MeV/c².\n    *   Total rest mass (m₀) = 3 * m_p + 3 * m_n = 3 * (938.272 MeV/c²) + 3 * (939.565 MeV/c²) = 2814.816 MeV/c² + 2818.695 MeV/c² = 5633.511 MeV/c².\n3.  **Rest Energy Calculation**: The rest energy (E₀) is m₀c².\n    *   E₀ = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.\n4.  **Lorentz Factor Calculation**: The speed (v) is 0.96c. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7.\n5.  **Total Energy Calculation**: The total energy (E) is given by E = γE₀.\n    *   E = (25/7) * 5.633511 GeV ≈ 20.1197 GeV.\n\nThis calculated value of 20.1197 GeV is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants in the problem's formulation.To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Components**: The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons. With 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)**: The rest energy of the nucleus can be calculated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. This approach is a common simplification in such problems, which ignores the nuclear binding energy.\n    *   The rest energy of a single proton is approximately 938.272 MeV.\n    *   The rest energy of a single neutron is approximately 939.565 MeV.\n    *   The total rest energy E₀ for ⁶Li (3 protons and 3 neutrons) is:\n        E₀ = (3 * 938.272 MeV) + (3 * 939.565 MeV)\n        E₀ = 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV\n        E₀ = 5633.511 MeV\n    *   Converting this to Giga-electronvolts (GeV):\n        E₀ = 5.633511 GeV\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**: The Lorentz factor is a function of the object's speed (v) relative to the speed of light (c).\n    *   Given speed v = 0.96c.\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714... (which is exactly 25/7)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E)**: The total relativistic energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   E = (25/7) * 5.633511 GeV\n    *   E ≈ 20.1197 GeV\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.1197 GeV is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (approximately 0.06%) can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used for the proton and neutron masses.\n\n<<<B>>>"
