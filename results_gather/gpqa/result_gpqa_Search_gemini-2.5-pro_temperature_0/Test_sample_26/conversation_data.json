    "The story describes the initial steps of the secretory pathway for a protein. Let's break down the clues:\n\n*   **\"The ribonucleoprotein particle\"**: This is the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), a complex of RNA and protein that identifies proteins destined for secretion.\n*   **\"the nascent chain\"**: This is a newly forming polypeptide chain being synthesized by a ribosome.\n*   **Where they meet**: The SRP binds to a signal sequence on the nascent chain as it emerges from a ribosome. This event occurs in the cytosol.\n*   **\"Pause there for a minute\"**: The binding of SRP to the nascent chain temporarily halts protein synthesis.\n*   **\"Let me show you in\"**: The SRP guides the entire ribosome-nascent chain complex to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\n*   **\"It seems somewhat rough\"**: This is a direct reference to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), which is studded with ribosomes, giving it a \"rough\" appearance under a microscope.\n*   **\"you really need some sugar\"**: This refers to glycosylation, a common modification for secreted proteins where sugar chains are added. This process begins in the lumen of the ER.\n*   **\"I need to be on my way\"**: This signifies the protein's journey through the secretory pathway. After being synthesized into the rough ER, the protein travels to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and is then packaged into vesicles. These vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane to release the protein outside the cell, into the extracellular space.\n\nTherefore, the meeting occurs in the cytosol, and the chain's ultimate destination, as a secreted protein, is the extracellular space.\n\n<<<B>>>"
