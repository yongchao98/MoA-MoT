    "If a magnet could have an isolated north or south pole, known as a magnetic monopole, two of Maxwell's equations would be modified to account for this new phenomenon.\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In its standard form, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0). This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic monopoles have never been observed; magnetic field lines always form closed loops. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, so this law would be modified to show the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρm).\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). If magnetic monopoles exist and move, they would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This would add a new term to Faraday's Law, making the equations for electricity and magnetism more symmetrical.\n\nTherefore, the existence of magnetic monopoles would alter the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
