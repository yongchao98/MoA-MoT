    "### Compound Identification\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n**1. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy:**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness of this peak is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also a key feature of carboxylic acids.\n\nAll four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, meaning the FTIR data is consistent with any of the choices. Therefore, the ¹H NMR data is crucial for distinguishing the correct structure.\n\n**2. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive clues for identifying the correct structure through the analysis of spin-spin splitting patterns. The problem states that there are no signals corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which is consistent with all four saturated structures. The key is the presence of two specific complex signals: a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the methine (CH) protons in each proposed structure:\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** This structure would show a proton with a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) pattern, but it lacks a proton that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). Instead, it would have a signal with a doublet of triplets (dt) pattern.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at carbon 3 is adjacent to one proton at carbon 4 (giving a doublet), two protons at carbon 2 (giving a triplet), and the two protons of the ethyl group at carbon 3 (giving another triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching one of the observed signals.\n    *   The proton at carbon 4 is adjacent to one proton at carbon 3 (giving a doublet), the two protons of the ethyl group at carbon 5 (giving a triplet), and the three protons of the methyl group at carbon 4 (giving a quartet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the other key signal.\n    This structure is the only one that accounts for both observed complex splitting patterns.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would appear as a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq), but it does not have a proton that would give a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). It would instead show a doublet of quartets (dq).\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This structure contains a proton that would give a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). However, the other key methine proton would be split into a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq), not a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly structure B, which corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, as it is the only option that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
