    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Notation\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, relative to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[A/B] = log10(n_A/n_B)_star - log10(n_A/n_B)_sun`\n\nwhere `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of atoms of elements A and B, respectively. The unit \"dex\" stands for \"decimal exponent,\" which is another way of saying it's a base-10 logarithm.\n\nA key identity can be derived from this definition:\n`[A/B] = ([A/H]) - ([B/H])`\n\nThis identity allows us to relate different abundance ratios.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nUsing the identity `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`, we can write:\n`[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`\n\nNow, we can solve for `[Si/H]_1`:\n`0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nThis tells us the logarithmic abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen for Star 1, compared to the Sun.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nUsing the same identity:\n`[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n\nNow, we solve for `[Si/H]_2`:\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = -0.3` dex\n\nThis gives us the logarithmic abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen for Star 2, compared to the Sun.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. In astrophysics, this typically refers to the ratio of their abundances relative to hydrogen, which is the primary constituent of a star's photosphere. We need to calculate `(n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n\nLet's take the difference between the `[Si/H]` values we found:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nNow, let's expand this expression using the definition of `[Si/H]`:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = (log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun) - (log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun)`\n\nThe solar abundance term `log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun` cancels out:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_2`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2 )`\n\nWe already calculated the value of the left side to be 0.6. Therefore:\n`0.6 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2 )`\n\nTo find the final ratio, we take the antilogarithm (10 to the power of 0.6):\nRatio = `10^0.6`\nRatio â‰ˆ `3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of Mg and Fe was not required for the final calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
