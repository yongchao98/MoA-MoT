    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis for carbon-carbon bond formation. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The prompt states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and are highly sensitive to steric hindrance. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is a quaternary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group in addition to two other ring carbons (C2, C6) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   **C6** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom and two other ring carbons (C1, C5) and the epoxide oxygen.\n    Due to the significant steric bulk of the methyl group on C1 compared to the hydrogen on C6, the incoming nucleophilic methyl group from Me2CuLi will preferentially attack the less hindered **C6**. This regioselectivity eliminates options C and D, which would result from an attack at C1.\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds through an S_N2-type mechanism. A key feature of the S_N2 reaction is the inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked by the nucleophile. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (backside attack).\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as **(S)**.\n    *   The S_N2 attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration of this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n    *   The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,**6S**)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The nucleophilic methyl group attacks C6.\n*   The C6-O bond breaks, and after an acidic workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with methyl groups at the original positions (C1, C3, C4) and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature for the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group (original C1) is now C1. The carbon that was attacked (original C6) is now C2.\n*   The stereochemistry of the product will be:\n    *   C1 retains its configuration: **(1R)**\n    *   C6 inverts to become C2: (6S) â†’ **(2R)**\n    *   C4 retains its configuration: **(4R)**\n    *   C3 retains its configuration and becomes C5: **(5R)**\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
