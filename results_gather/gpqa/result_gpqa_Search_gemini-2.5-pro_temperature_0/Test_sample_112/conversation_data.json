    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H (hydroxyl) group involved in hydrogen bonding. The significant broadness, centered around the C-H stretching region, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1710 cm⁻¹ is typical for a saturated, hydrogen-bonded (dimeric) carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch. The presence of both a C=O and a C=C group suggests an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺. This provides strong evidence for the presence of a -COOH functional group.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or π (pi) bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with the evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that requires two oxygen atoms.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. This cannot account for both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a C=C double bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. It also has two degrees of unsaturation. One degree can be attributed to the C=O bond in the carboxyl group, and the second can be attributed to the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This option fits all the spectral data.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has two oxygens but only one degree of unsaturation. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the evidence for a C=C double bond from the FTIR and NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to a compound that contains a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. The formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is the only option that provides the necessary two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both the carbonyl (C=O) and the alkene (C=C) functionalities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
