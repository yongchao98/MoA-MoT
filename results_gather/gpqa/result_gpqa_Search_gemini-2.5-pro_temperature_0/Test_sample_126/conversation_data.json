    "The correct molecule formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated is **A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the chemical transformation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The heating of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, which is a 1,5-diene system, points towards a Cope rearrangement. This is a type of-sigmatropic rearrangement that is common for 1,5-dienes and occurs under thermal conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is:\n    ```\n          CH2CH2CH2CH3 (Butyl group)\n          |\n    CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH-CH=CH-CH2-CH3\n    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9\n    ```\n    This molecule contains a C=C-C-C-C=C framework (specifically atoms C2 through C7), which is the required structure for a Cope rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Mechanism of the Cope Rearrangement:** The reaction proceeds through a concerted, cyclic transition state, often resembling a chair conformation. In this process:\n    *   The single bond between carbon-4 and carbon-5 breaks.\n    *   A new single bond forms between carbon-2 and carbon-7.\n    *   The double bonds shift from C2=C3 and C6=C7 to C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** Applying these bond changes to the starting material results in a new molecular structure. Let's trace the connectivity of the product:\n    *   The original methyl group (C1) is attached to C2, which is now single-bonded to C3.\n    *   A new double bond forms between C3 and C4.\n    *   The original C2 is now bonded to C7, which carries an ethyl group (C8-C9).\n    *   A new double bond forms between C5 and C6.\n    *   The butyl group remains attached to C5.\n\n    The resulting molecule is:\n    ```\n    CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the Product:** To name this new molecule according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that contains both double bonds.\n    *   The longest chain has 10 carbon atoms (a deca- chain).\n    *   Numbering from the left gives the double bonds the lowest possible positions (1 and 5), so it is a deca-1,5-diene.\n    *   There is a methyl group on carbon 3 and an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents gives the final name: **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nThis matches option A. The reaction is driven by the formation of a thermodynamically stable product, which can be influenced by factors like steric strain relief, even if the substitution pattern of the double bonds appears less favorable at first glance.\n\n<<<A>>>"
