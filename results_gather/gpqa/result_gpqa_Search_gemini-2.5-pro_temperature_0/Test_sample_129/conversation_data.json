    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds that can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light and the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength**: The Lyman-alpha spectral line, which is absorbed by neutral hydrogen, has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff**: Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet radiation from reaching the ground. Ground-based telescopes can generally only detect light with wavelengths longer than about 3200-3500 Å (320-350 nm) due to atmospheric absorption, primarily by ozone. For a signal to be reliably detected, its wavelength must be shifted into this observable \"optical window.\"\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation**: The redshift (z) describes how much the light from a distant object has been stretched to longer wavelengths by the expansion of the universe. The relationship between rest wavelength (λ_rest), observed wavelength (λ_observed), and redshift is given by the formula:\n\n    1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\n    To find the minimum redshift, we need the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Å) to be shifted to at least the minimum wavelength detectable from the ground (~3500 Å).\n\n    z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n    z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n    z ≈ 2.88 - 1\n    z ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation shows that the redshift must be approximately 1.9 or greater for the Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be shifted into the range accessible by ground-based optical telescopes. One source explicitly states that the Lyman-alpha line is accessible to optical ground-based telescopes in the redshift range of approximately z = 2 to z = 7.\n\nComparing our calculated value of z ≈ 1.88 with the given options:\nA) 1.9\nB) 3\nC) 1.2\nD) 2.4\n\nThe value 1.9 is the closest to our calculated lower limit.\n\n<<<A>>>"
