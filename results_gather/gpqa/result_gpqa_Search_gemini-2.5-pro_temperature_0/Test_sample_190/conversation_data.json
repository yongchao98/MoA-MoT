    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol (the most acidic proton) to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazine) in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl). This reaction converts the ketone into a tosylhydrazone through a condensation reaction, where a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. These are the conditions for a Shapiro reaction. In this reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonate the hydrazone and then the less-substituted α-carbon. The intermediate then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species, which is then protonated by the aqueous ammonium chloride to yield an alkene. The ketone at position 1 is thus removed and replaced by a double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** The major product will have the double bond formed between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted adjacent carbon (C6). The isopropenyl and benzyloxymethyl groups remain.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. These conditions are standard for reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be reduced. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. Furthermore, catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is a very common and effective method for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers, converting them back to alcohols.\n*   **Final Transformation:** The isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group, the cyclohexene is reduced to a cyclohexane, and the benzyl ether is cleaved back to the primary alcohol.\n\nThe final structure, Product 4, is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Based on the numbering of the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring. This corresponds to the name (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The butyl group from n-BuLi does not add to the molecule in a Shapiro reaction, and the benzyl ether would be cleaved.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches the expected outcome of the full reaction sequence.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This represents an unreacted or partially reacted intermediate.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, which is unlikely under these standard hydrogenation conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
