    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Radiating Source and Radiation Type\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape.\" In physics, any oscillating charge distribution can be analyzed by a multipole expansion (monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc.).\n\n*   **Monopole Radiation:** An oscillating monopole (total charge) would violate the principle of charge conservation, so it does not occur.\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** This is the most common and typically the dominant form of radiation. It arises from a separation of positive and negative charges oscillating back and forth. For a generic oscillating charge system, the electric dipole moment is the lowest-order, non-zero term. Its power scales with the fourth power of the oscillation frequency (ω⁴).\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** This type of radiation dominates only if the electric dipole moment of the system is zero for all time. This occurs in systems with specific symmetries, for instance, a spheroid changing its shape from prolate to oblate while keeping its center fixed. The power of quadrupole radiation is proportional to the sixth power of the frequency (ω⁶).\n\nWithout any information suggesting that the electric dipole moment is zero, the most natural and fundamental assumption is that the radiation is dominated by the electric dipole term.\n\n### 2. Determine the Angular Distribution of Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment and frequency, and `θ` is the angle with the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n*   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n*   The question asks for the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n*   The power at 30° is `(dP/dΩ)_30° = A * sin²(30°)`.\n*   Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n*   Therefore, the power radiated at 30° is `A/4`. The fraction is **1/4**.\n\nThis result eliminates options C and D.\n\n### 3. Determine the Wavelength (λ) Dependence\n\nThe radiated power is a function of the angular frequency `ω`. For electric dipole radiation, the total power is proportional to `ω⁴`. The power per unit solid angle has the same dependence.\n\n*   `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   Substituting this into the proportionality gives: `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴` or `dP/dΩ ∝ λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThis is the well-known principle behind Rayleigh scattering, where the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.\n\nThis result shows that the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the two parts of the analysis:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The possible form of the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
