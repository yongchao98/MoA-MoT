    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. It has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed. The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one proton. Therefore, the base will abstract the proton from C6, forming an enolate.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate anion, with the negative charge on C6, acts as the nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition that forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting product has a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound as per the given options, the ethyl propanoate part is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is the original C6 of the ring. For naming purposes, this carbon is now C1 of the cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   The methyl group that was on C6 is now on C1 of the substituent.\n    *   The ketone group (=O) is on the adjacent carbon, which is C2 (the original C1 of the ketone).\n    *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (original C2) is now C3 of the substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), removes an acidic α-proton from 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic. This forms a carbanion (a nitronate ion), `[CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)]⁻`, which serves as the Michael donor.\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one in the `CH₃-CH=` part of the molecule.\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting acyclic structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end, we find a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
