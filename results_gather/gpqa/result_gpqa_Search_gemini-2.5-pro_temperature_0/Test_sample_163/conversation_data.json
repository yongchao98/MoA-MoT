    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics applied to double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. For such systems, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law relates the orbital period, the semi-major axis (a), and the total mass of the system.\n2.  **Radial Velocity Information**: For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, we can measure the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of both stars from the Doppler shift of their spectral lines.\n3.  **Inclination Angle (i)**: The observed radial velocities are the line-of-sight components of the orbital velocities and depend on the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight. However, the problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information, as eclipses only occur when the inclination angle *i* is close to 90 degrees (i.e., the system is viewed edge-on). For an inclination of 90°, sin(i) is 1, which simplifies the calculations significantly.\n\nFor a circular orbit in an eclipsing binary system (where sin(i) ≈ 1), the total mass of the system can be derived from the following formula:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2), we can set up a ratio of this equation for the two systems. The constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out.\n\nThe ratio is:\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nM1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated factor of ~0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
