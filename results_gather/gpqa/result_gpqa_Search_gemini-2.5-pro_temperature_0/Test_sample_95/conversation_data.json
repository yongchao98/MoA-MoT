    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Determine the Size of the Event Horizon\n\nFirst, we calculate the diameter of the event horizon (which we can denote as *D*) using the small-angle formula, which relates the angular size (θ), the distance to the object (*d*), and its actual size.\n\nThe given values are:\n*   Distance, *d* = 10¹⁰ parsecs\n*   Angular size, θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees\n\nWe need to convert these to standard units (meters and radians, respectively).\n\n*   **Convert distance from parsecs to meters:**\n    1 parsec ≈ 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n    *d* = 10¹⁰ pc * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m/pc) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m.\n\n*   **Convert angular size from degrees to radians:**\n    1 degree = π / 180 radians.\n    θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees * (π / 180) rad/degree ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians.\n\nNow, we can find the diameter *D* of the event horizon:\n*D* = *d* * θ\n*D* ≈ (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ rad) ≈ 5.385 x 10⁷ m.\n\nThe radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius (*R*<sub>s</sub>), is half of the diameter.\n*R*<sub>s</sub> = *D* / 2 ≈ 2.693 x 10⁷ m.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon\n\nThe area of the event horizon (*A*) is the surface area of a sphere with the Schwarzschild radius.\n*A* = 4π *R*<sub>s</sub>²\n*A* ≈ 4π * (2.693 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 9.11 x 10¹⁵ m².\n\n### 3. Calculate the Entropy of the Black Hole\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\nS = (k * A) / (4 * l<sub>p</sub>²)\n\nWhere:\n*   *S* is the entropy.\n*   *k* is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   *A* is the area of the event horizon we just calculated.\n*   *l*<sub>p</sub> is the Planck length (≈ 1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m).\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\nS ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K * 9.11 x 10¹⁵ m²) / (4 * (1.616 x 10⁻³⁵ m)²)\nS ≈ (1.257 x 10⁻⁷ J·m²/K) / (4 * 2.611 x 10⁻⁷⁰ m²)\nS ≈ (1.257 x 10⁻⁷ J·m²/K) / (1.044 x 10⁻⁶⁹ m²)\nS ≈ 1.204 x 10⁶² J/K.\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 1.204 x 10⁶² J/K. The order of magnitude is 10⁶², which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
