    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels and State Identification\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)*\n\nWhere:\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant.\n\nThe molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Initial State:** (v=0, J=0)\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" that can be reached by absorbing a photon is governed by spectroscopic selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from J=0, only a ΔJ = +1 transition is possible.\n*   **Selection Rules:** Δv = +1, ΔJ = +1\n*   **Final State:** (v=1, J=1)\n\n### 2. Calculation of Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω + B(0)(1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(2) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant B.\n\n**a. Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass of the X-Y molecule is calculated as:\nμ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y)\nμ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\nConverting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg):\nμ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass and the bond length (R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\nI = μ * R²\nI ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Rotational Constant (B):**\nThe rotational constant is given by:\nB = ħ² / (2I)\nB ≈ (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n**d. Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we can calculate the total energy change by summing the vibrational and rotational parts.\n*   Vibrational Energy Part: ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational Energy Part: ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 2 * (4.604 × 10⁻²³ J) = 9.208 × 10⁻²³ J\n*   Total Energy: ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0009208 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 3. Calculation of Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s). Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.406 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
