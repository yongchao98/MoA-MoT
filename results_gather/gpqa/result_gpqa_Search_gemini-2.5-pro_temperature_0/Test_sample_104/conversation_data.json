    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spotted star, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation. This variation is due to the contrast between the unspotted hemisphere and the hemisphere partially covered by cooler, dark spots.\n\n### 1. Calculating the Flux Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness or flux (F) of a star is related to its effective temperature (T) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where flux is proportional to T⁴. We can calculate the relative flux difference between the two hemispheres of the star.\n\n*   **Effective Temperature of the Star (T_eff):** 6000 K\n*   **Temperature of the Spots (T_spot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Filling Factor of Spots (f):** 20% or 0.20 (on one hemisphere)\n\nThe maximum flux (F_max) is observed when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature of 6000 K, is facing the observer.\n\nThe minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view. On this side, 20% of the area has a temperature of 5000 K, and the remaining 80% has a temperature of 6000 K.\n\nThe amplitude (A) of this rotational modulation is the relative change in flux:\n\nA = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of temperatures:\n\nA = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nA = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nA = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nA = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nA = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nA ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.36% due to the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### 2. Equating to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming of a star's light caused by a transiting exoplanet is known as the transit depth. For a simplified case, this depth is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area. This is equivalent to the square of the ratio of their radii (R_pl / R_star).\n\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that mimics the starspot signal, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude of the starspot variation:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = A\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
