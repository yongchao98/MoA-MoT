    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we need the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n### Step 2: Determine the volume of strong acid needed\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a strong acid is a neutralization reaction. The net ionic equation is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of this reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ ions to dissolve completely.\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\nThe problem states we are using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, which provides 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter (1000 cm³). We can now calculate the minimum volume of this acid needed.\n*   Volume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Molarity = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume matches the value given in option D (28.05 cm³), with the minor difference likely due to rounding of molar masses.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nWhen the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved by the stoichiometric amount of acid, the resulting solution contains Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ion, more accurately the hexaaquairon(III) ion, [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, acts as a weak acid by hydrolyzing water.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\nFirst, calculate the concentration of the Fe³⁺ ion in the final solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\nTo find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ ion. According to multiple sources, the Ka for this ion is approximately 6.0 x 10⁻³.\n\nNow, we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺ | 0.009357 | -x | 0.009357 - x |\n| [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺| 0 | +x | x |\n| H₃O⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nThe Ka expression is:\nKa = [H₃O⁺] * [[Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺] / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n6.0 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n\nThis gives the quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.0 x 10⁻³)x - (5.614 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n*   x = [-(6.0 x 10⁻³) ± √((6.0 x 10⁻³)² - 4(1)(-5.614 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± √(3.6 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.2456 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± √(2.6056 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\n*   x = [-0.006 ± 0.01614] / 2\n\nSince concentration (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:\n*   x = (0.01014) / 2 ≈ 0.00507 M\n\nThe concentration of H₃O⁺ is x, so [H₃O⁺] ≈ 0.00507 M.\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log[H₃O⁺] = -log(0.00507) ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated pH (2.29) is closest to the pH value in option D (2.04). The discrepancy can arise from using slightly different values for molar masses, the Ka of Fe³⁺, or the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃, which can vary between sources. However, the calculated acid volume is a very strong match for option D, and the pH is in the correct acidic range, making D the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Volume of acid: 28.05 cm³ (matches calculation)\n*   pH: 2.04 (reasonably close to the calculated value of 2.29, and much closer than other options)\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
