    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H) is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   Two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is next to an alkyl group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent:\n        *   A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n        *   A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n        *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) indicates a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   Assembling these fragments—a CH, a CH₂, and two CH₃ groups—and considering their splitting patterns, the alkyl group is identified as a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\nBased on this analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a strong reduction. This reagent combination is known to completely reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nIn this specific case, the 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced. The carboxylic acid functional group is converted to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n\nThe correct final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
