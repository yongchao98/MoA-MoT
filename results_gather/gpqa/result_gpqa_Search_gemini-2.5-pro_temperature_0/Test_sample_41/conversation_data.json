    "The search results confirm the physical principles I used.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The formula for equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is confirmed. It is derived from the balance between the energy absorbed by the planet from its star and the energy it radiates away. The key relationship for this problem is that T_eq is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance (a), assuming the star's properties and the planet's albedo are constant. The problem states the orbits are circular, so the semi-major axis 'a' is the orbital distance. It also states the albedo is the same for all three planets.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The search results unanimously confirm that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be written as P² ∝ a³. This law is a very close approximation when the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a safe assumption for exoplanetary systems.\n\nThe calculation steps remain valid:\n\n1.  **Establish the relationship between temperature and orbital distance.**\n    *   From the equilibrium temperature formula, T_eq ∝ 1 / √a.\n\n2.  **Use the given temperature ratios to find the ratio of orbital distances.**\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1) = 1.4  => a2 / a1 = 1.4² = 1.96\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = √(a3 / a2) = 2.3  => a3 / a2 = 2.3² = 5.29\n    *   Combine these to find the ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n        a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of orbital periods.**\n    *   P² ∝ a³  =>  (P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n    *   P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.4365\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4. The information about the masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous to this specific calculation. The albedo value is important because it is *equal* for all planets, simplifying the temperature relationship.\n\nThe calculation is robust. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 10.4 (This is close to a3/a1)\nB) ~ 3.2 (This is close to sqrt(a3/a1))\nC) ~ 4.4\nD) ~ 33.4 (This matches my calculation)\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the equilibrium temperature of a planet to its orbital period. This involves two key physical principles: the formula for planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem states that the albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the formula simplifies to show that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n`T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances**\n\nWe are given the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures:\n*   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n*   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 1, we can write:\n*   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1) = 1.4`\n*   `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = √(a3 / a2) = 2.3`\n\nBy squaring these equations, we find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   `a2 / a1 = 1.4² = 1.96`\n*   `a3 / a2 = 2.3² = 5.29`\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (`a3 / a1`), we multiply these two ratios:\n`a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n**Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n`P² ∝ a³`\nThis can be written as a ratio:\n`(P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n\nNow we can solve for the ratio of the orbital periods (`P3 / P1`):\n`P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)`\n\nSubstitute the value of `a3 / a1` we calculated in Step 2:\n`P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)`\n`P3 / P1 ≈ 33.4365`\n\nThe orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
