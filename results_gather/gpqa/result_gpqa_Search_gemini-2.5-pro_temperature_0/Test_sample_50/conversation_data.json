    "The problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the potential energy:\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image\" charge. This image charge is positioned such that the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Position**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` is half of the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, and simply calculating the interaction potential `q * V_image` would double-count the energy. The work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge.\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Formula**:\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_image = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The potential energy of the system is:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
