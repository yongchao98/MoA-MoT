    "To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, each compound must be analyzed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule is an alkene. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name of this complex molecule includes specific stereochemical descriptors ((3aR,7aS)). This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry that lies between these two carbons. This makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, is non-superimposable. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. The designation of a specific enantiomer means the compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, has the three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposing CH2 group on the ring. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not possess any chiral centers. The carbon in the chain bonded to two methyl groups (C3) is not chiral, and no other carbon atom has four different substituents. The molecule as a whole is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
