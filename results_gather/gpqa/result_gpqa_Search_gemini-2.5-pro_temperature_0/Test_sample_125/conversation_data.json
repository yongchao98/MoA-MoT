    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the original molecule is chiral, the hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different stereoisomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. For a molecule with two stereocenters, there are up to 2Â² = 4 possible stereoisomers. However, due to the symmetry of pentane-2,4-diol, the possibilities are:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) forms are identical and represent a single achiral *meso* compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) along with the meso compound. Therefore, three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound from Reaction II)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated, eluting as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC.\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   In the products from Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the racemic pair will elute as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak, resulting in **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct and have different polarities compared to the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   The column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The column will separate the three stereoisomers from Reaction II. The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks, and the meso compound will give a third distinct peak. This results in **three peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
