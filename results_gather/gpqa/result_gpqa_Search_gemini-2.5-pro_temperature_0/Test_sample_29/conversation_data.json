    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first calculate the wavelength of the emitted light and then relate it to the absorbed light.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\n\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is given by the formula:\n\nλ = hc / E\n\nA commonly used and convenient approximation for this formula is:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Color of Emitted Light\n\nWe now compare this wavelength to the visible light spectrum to determine the color. The visible spectrum is typically defined as follows:\n*   **Violet:** 380–436 nm\n*   **Blue:** 436–495 nm\n*   **Green:** 495–566 nm\n*   **Yellow:** 566–589 nm\n*   **Orange:** 589–627 nm\n*   **Red:** 627–780 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls squarely within the **green** portion of the visible spectrum.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Color of Absorbed Light\n\nThe process described is fluorescence, where a molecule absorbs light and then emits light at a longer wavelength. This means the emitted light has lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n\n*   **Emitted Light:** ~530 nm (Green), Energy = 2.3393 eV\n*   **Absorbed Light:** Must have higher energy and therefore a shorter wavelength than the emitted light (λ < 530 nm).\n\nNow let's examine the options provided:\n*   **A) Blue:** Wavelength is approximately 436-495 nm. This is shorter than 530 nm and represents higher energy.\n*   **B) Red:** Wavelength is approximately 627-780 nm. This is longer than 530 nm and represents lower energy.\n*   **C) Violet:** Wavelength is approximately 380-436 nm. This is shorter than 530 nm and represents higher energy.\n*   **D) Yellow:** Wavelength is approximately 566-589 nm. This is longer than 530 nm and represents lower energy.\n\nBased on the principle of fluorescence, the absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength than the emitted green light. This eliminates Red and Yellow as possibilities. We are left with Blue and Violet.\n\nIn fluorescent dyes, the absorption and emission spectra are often close to each other. An emission in the green part of the spectrum (530 nm) is most commonly caused by absorption in the adjacent, higher-energy blue region. An absorption in the violet region would likely lead to an emission in the blue or blue-green region, not as far as green. Therefore, blue light is the most plausible color to have been absorbed.\n\n<<<A>>>"
