The key is a careful stoichiometric calculation to find which species is in excess after neutralization.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation, highlighting the most important points:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Initial Moles of All Reactants**\nThe first step is to calculate the moles of all acidic and basic species present in the solution.\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid that dissociates completely.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This is a critical detail.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = Molarity × Volume (L) × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Limiting and Excess Reactants**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We can sum the moles of all acidic species to find the total amount of acid that will be neutralized.\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺)** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the total moles, we find that the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Moles of Excess Reactant**\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH of the Final Solution**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the total volume of the mixture.\n*   **Calculate Total Volume:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Calculate Final [OH⁻] Concentration:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We have calculated the hydroxide concentration, so we must first find the pOH. A common mistake is to report the pOH as the final pH.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25 °C), we find the pH:\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final calculated pH is 12.62. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 1.38 (This is the pOH, a common distractor.)\nC) 8.68\nD) 12.62\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to potential pitfalls.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles of Reactants**\nThe first step is to determine the number of moles of each acidic and basic species being mixed together. The formula for moles is Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   `0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   `0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol`\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** hydroxide ions for every one formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This is a critical detail.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = `0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol`\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = `2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol`\n\n**2. Perform the Neutralization Reaction**\nNext, we determine which species is in excess after the neutralization reaction. The strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** To find the total amount of acid to be neutralized, we sum the moles from both the strong and weak acids.\n    *   Total moles of acid = (moles from HCl) + (moles from CH3COOH)\n    *   Total moles of acid = `0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol`\n*   **Compare total acid and total base:**\n    *   Total moles of acid = 0.130 mol\n    *   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n*   Since the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the final solution will be basic due to an excess of OH⁻ ions.\n*   **Calculate moles of excess OH⁻:**\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = (Total moles OH⁻) - (Total moles acid)\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = `0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol`\n\n**3. Calculate the Final pH**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the final total volume.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = `500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L`\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = `0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** We have the hydroxide ion concentration, so we must first calculate the pOH. A common mistake is to report the pOH as the final answer.\n    *   `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38`\n*   **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62`\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly shows the final pH of the solution is 12.62. Reviewing the provided options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 8.68\nC) 1.38 (This is the pOH, a common distractor)\nD) 12.62 (This matches our calculation)\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step stoichiometric analysis to find the final pH of a mixed solution containing a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. The unanimous agreement among all candidate agents on the calculation method provides high confidence in the approach.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the steps and the careful points to consider:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. We calculate moles using the formula: Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.180 mol\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The most critical detail here is that barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound. Forgetting this 1:2 stoichiometry is a common error.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acid and base and find the excess reactant.**\nA strong base will react completely with all available acidic protons, regardless of whether they come from a strong or weak acid.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = (Moles from HCl) + (Moles from CH3COOH)\n    Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130), the final solution will be basic due to excess hydroxide ions.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** It is essential to sum *all* moles of acid that will be neutralized by the strong base to correctly determine the limiting and excess reagents.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻** = (Total moles of base) - (Total moles of acid)\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The final concentration must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all the solutions.\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles / Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH from the concentration.**\nBecause we have the concentration of OH⁻, we must first calculate the pOH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** A frequent mistake is to report the pOH value (1.38) as the final answer instead of converting it to pH. Option C (1.38) is a distractor targeting this exact error.\n\nThe final calculated pH is 12.62. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the final answer, a thorough analysis of the problem is required, paying close attention to several key details. The unanimous consensus on the calculation method across all candidate answers provides a high degree of confidence in the correct process.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:** The first step is to determine the moles of all acidic and basic species.\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid): 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid): 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base): 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:** Compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n    *   Total moles of acid = 0.050 mol (from CH3COOH) + 0.080 mol (from HCl) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = **0.180 mol**\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n\n3.  **Calculate Excess Moles:**\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** The concentration of the excess OH⁻ determines the pH.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Final [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n5.  **Calculate pH:** First, calculate pOH, then convert to pH.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** A critical point, handled correctly by all candidates, is that barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) provides **two** moles of OH⁻ ions for every mole of the compound. Failing to multiply by two would lead to an incorrect result.\n2.  **Treating All Acids Equally for Neutralization:** When a strong base is present, it will react with all available acidic protons, both from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH). For the purpose of finding the excess reactant, it's correct to sum the moles of all acidic species.\n3.  **Using Total Final Volume:** The concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the total volume of the final mixture (1200 mL or 1.2 L), not the volume of any single component.\n4.  **Distinguishing pOH from pH:** After calculating the excess [OH⁻], the direct result of the -log calculation is the pOH. A common mistake is to report this value as the final answer. The question asks for the pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH. The value of the pOH (1.38) is present as option A, acting as a distractor.\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a pH of 12.62.

Failing to account for this 1:2 ratio is a common error.\n    Moles OH⁻ = Molarity × Volume (L) × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**2. Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons until one is fully consumed.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Total Acid for Neutralization.** We can sum the moles of all acidic species that will be neutralized by the strong base.\n    Total moles of acid = (moles from HCl) + (moles from CH₃COOH)\n    Total moles of acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Compare total acid and total base:**\n    Total base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n    Total acid = 0.130 mol\n    Since the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n*   **Calculate moles of excess OH⁻:**\n    Excess OH⁻ = Total moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n*   **Careful Point 3: Total Final Volume.** The concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixture.\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Convert pOH to pH.** The concentration of OH⁻ is used to calculate the pOH first. The question asks for pH, which requires a final conversion step.\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:** Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n        pH = 14 - pOH\n        pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a pH of 12.62.

Calculate Initial Moles of All Reactants**\nThe first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of each acid and base being mixed.\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    `Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    HCl is a strong acid that fully dissociates.\n    `Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol`\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that fully dissociates to yield two OH⁻ ions for each unit.\n    `Moles = Molarity × Volume × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.180 mol`\n\n**2. Perform Stoichiometric Neutralization**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. To find the excess reactant, we compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n*   **Total Moles of Acid:**\n    `Total Acid = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol`\n*   **Total Moles of Base:**\n    `Total Base = Moles(OH⁻) = 0.180 mol`\n\nComparing the two, the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130). Thus, the final solution will be basic due to an excess of hydroxide ions.\n*   **Moles of Excess OH⁻:**\n    `Excess OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol`\n\n**3. Calculate Final Concentration and pH**\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base in the final total volume of the solution.\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    `Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L`\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    `[OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M`\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    First, we calculate the pOH from the hydroxide concentration.\n    `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38`\n    Then, we use the relationship `pH + pOH = 14`.\n    `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62`\n\n### **Careful Points and Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** It is essential to remember that Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻ per mole of the compound. Failing to multiply by two is a common error.\n*   **pH vs. pOH:** After finding the excess [OH⁻], the calculated value of -log([OH⁻]) gives the pOH. A frequent mistake is to report this value (1.38) as the pH. This value is present as option A and serves as a distractor. The question asks for pH, which requires subtracting the pOH from 14.\n*   **Excess Reactant:** Since a strong base is in excess, the final pH is determined solely by its concentration. The presence of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) has a negligible effect on the pH compared to the strong base.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe detailed calculation robustly yields a pH of **12.62**. All candidate agents' reasoning sections correctly performed these steps and arrived at this numerical value. The inconsistencies in their final letter choices suggest they may have been presented with differently ordered options. Based on the option list provided in this question, the calculated value of 12.62 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem involving an acid-base neutralization reaction. A step-by-step analysis is required to find the final pH. Based on the analysis of all candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation method, but some confusion in selecting the final lettered option. The following breakdown confirms the correct numerical answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\nThis is the foundational step.

This is a frequent point of error.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol of OH⁻**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acid and base to find the excess reactant.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid:**\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Sum all sources of acid.\n    *   Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   **0.180 mol**\n*   **Compare and find the excess:**\n    *   Since Moles of Base (0.180) > Moles of Acid (0.130), the base is in excess. The final solution will be basic.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total OH⁻ - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final concentration of the excess species.**\n\nThe concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Do not forget to sum the volumes of all three solutions.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Excess moles of OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final pH.**\n\nSince we have the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions, we first calculate the pOH.\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The most common mistake is to report the pOH (1.38) as the final answer. The question asks for pH. At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a pH of **12.62**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 8.68\nB) 8.92\nC) 1.38 (This is the calculated pOH value, a distractor).\nD) 12.62 (This matches our calculated pH).\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe python code execution has confirmed the manual calculation.\n\n**Summary of Verified Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Total Moles of Acid:**\n    *   (0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L) + (0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L) = 0.050 mol + 0.080 mol = **0.130 mol**\n2.  **Total Moles of Base (OH⁻):**\n    *   (0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n3.  **Excess Moles of Base (OH⁻):**\n    *   0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n4.  **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   Total Volume = 0.500 L + 0.400 L + 0.300 L = 1.2 L\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n5.  **pOH and pH:**\n    *   The code output shows: pOH ≈ 1.38\n    *   The code output shows: pH ≈ 12.62 (calculated as 14 - 1.38)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis and the confirming code output show that the final pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.

    "An analysis of the candidate answers shows a complete consensus on the correct calculation method. All discrepancies in the final letter choices arise from inconsistent option ordering presented to the agents, not from any errors in their chemical reasoning. The definitive solution is reached by following the universally agreed-upon steps while being mindful of several key points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires an acid-base neutralization calculation. The steps are:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.\n2.  Determine the limiting and excess reactants by comparing total acid to total base.\n3.  Calculate the concentration of the excess reactant in the final total volume.\n4.  Convert this concentration to pH.\n\n### **Detailed Calculation and Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Initial Moles of All Reactants**\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Stoichiometry of Dissociation.** A critical and frequently missed detail is that Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    Moles = (0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Excess Reactant after Neutralization**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Totaling Reactants.** The strong base will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. Therefore, we must sum the moles of all acidic species to find the total acid available for neutralization.\n    *   Total Moles of Acid = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n    *   Total Moles of Base = **0.180 mol**\n*   **Comparison:**\n    Moles of Base (0.180 mol) > Moles of Acid (0.130 mol).\n    This means the strong base is in excess, and the final solution's pH will be determined by it.\n*   **Excess Moles:**\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Final Concentration of Excess OH⁻**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Total Final Volume.** The concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the final mixture.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final [OH⁻] Concentration:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final pH**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Converting from pOH to pH.** Since we have calculated the concentration of hydroxide ions, the -log of this value gives the pOH, not the pH. This is a common pitfall. The value of the pOH (1.38) is present in the options as a distractor.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed calculation confirms that the final pH of the solution is 12.62. This matches the numerical result derived by all candidate agents. Comparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 12.62\nB) 8.68\nC) 1.38\nD) 8.92\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The key is a careful stoichiometric calculation to find which species is in excess after neutralization.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation, highlighting the most important points:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Initial Moles of All Reactants**\nThe first step is to calculate the moles of all acidic and basic species present in the solution.\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid that dissociates completely.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This is a critical detail.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = Molarity × Volume (L) × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Limiting and Excess Reactants**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We can sum the moles of all acidic species to find the total amount of acid that will be neutralized.\n*   **Total moles of acid (H⁺)** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the total moles, we find that the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Moles of Excess Reactant**\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n*   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH of the Final Solution**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the total volume of the mixture.\n*   **Calculate Total Volume:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Calculate Final [OH⁻] Concentration:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We have calculated the hydroxide concentration, so we must first find the pOH. A common mistake is to report the pOH as the final pH.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   Using the relation pH + pOH = 14 (at 25 °C), we find the pH:\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final calculated pH is 12.62.

Calculate Initial Moles of Reactants**\nThe first step is to determine the number of moles of each acidic and basic species being mixed together. The formula for moles is Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   `0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   `0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol`\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** hydroxide ions for every one formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This is a critical detail.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = `0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol`\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = `2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol`\n\n**2. Perform the Neutralization Reaction**\nNext, we determine which species is in excess after the neutralization reaction. The strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** To find the total amount of acid to be neutralized, we sum the moles from both the strong and weak acids.\n    *   Total moles of acid = (moles from HCl) + (moles from CH3COOH)\n    *   Total moles of acid = `0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol`\n*   **Compare total acid and total base:**\n    *   Total moles of acid = 0.130 mol\n    *   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = 0.180 mol\n*   Since the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid, the final solution will be basic due to an excess of OH⁻ ions.\n*   **Calculate moles of excess OH⁻:**\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = (Total moles OH⁻) - (Total moles acid)\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = `0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol`\n\n**3. Calculate the Final pH**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the final total volume.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = `500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L`\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = `0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** We have the hydroxide ion concentration, so we must first calculate the pOH. A common mistake is to report the pOH as the final answer.\n    *   `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38`\n*   **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62`\n\n**4.

Forgetting this 1:2 stoichiometry is a common error.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acid and base and find the excess reactant.**\nA strong base will react completely with all available acidic protons, regardless of whether they come from a strong or weak acid.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = (Moles from HCl) + (Moles from CH3COOH)\n    Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130), the final solution will be basic due to excess hydroxide ions.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** It is essential to sum *all* moles of acid that will be neutralized by the strong base to correctly determine the limiting and excess reagents.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻** = (Total moles of base) - (Total moles of acid)\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The final concentration must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all the solutions.\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles / Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH from the concentration.**\nBecause we have the concentration of OH⁻, we must first calculate the pOH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** A frequent mistake is to report the pOH value (1.38) as the final answer instead of converting it to pH. Option C (1.38) is a distractor targeting this exact error.\n\nThe final calculated pH is 12.62. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the final answer, a thorough analysis of the problem is required, paying close attention to several key details. The unanimous consensus on the calculation method across all candidate answers provides a high degree of confidence in the correct process.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:** The first step is to determine the moles of all acidic and basic species.\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid): 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid): 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base): 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Perform Neutralization:** Compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n    *   Total moles of acid = 0.050 mol (from CH3COOH) + 0.080 mol (from HCl) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   Total moles of base (OH⁻) = **0.180 mol**\n    *   Since moles of base > moles of acid, the base is in excess.\n\n3.  **Calculate Excess Moles:**\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Concentration:** The concentration of the excess OH⁻ determines the pH.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Final [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n5.  **Calculate pH:** First, calculate pOH, then convert to pH.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** A critical point, handled correctly by all candidates, is that barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) provides **two** moles of OH⁻ ions for every mole of the compound. Failing to multiply by two would lead to an incorrect result.\n2.  **Treating All Acids Equally for Neutralization:** When a strong base is present, it will react with all available acidic protons, both from the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH). For the purpose of finding the excess reactant, it's correct to sum the moles of all acidic species.\n3.  **Using Total Final Volume:** The concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the total volume of the final mixture (1200 mL or 1.2 L), not the volume of any single component.\n4.  **Distinguishing pOH from pH:** After calculating the excess [OH⁻], the direct result of the -log calculation is the pOH. A common mistake is to report this value as the final answer. The question asks for the pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH. The value of the pOH (1.38) is present as option A, acting as a distractor.\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a pH of 12.62. Based on the options provided in the problem description:\n\nA) 1.38\nB) 8.68\nC) 8.92\nD) 12.62\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step stoichiometric analysis to find the pH of a solution created by mixing a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base.

The discrepancy in their final lettered choices (A, B, C, or D) stems from inconsistent option lists they were likely provided with, not from flaws in their chemical reasoning. A step-by-step analysis, incorporating the careful points identified from the agents' reasoning, leads to a definitive answer.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step.

A thorough analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method, with any discrepancies arising from clerical errors in matching the final numerical result to the lettered options. Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\nThis is the foundational step. We must calculate the moles of each reactant and identify the total potential for acidity and basicity.\n*   **A careful point** is to correctly identify that Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to yield **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every one mole of the compound.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume (L) × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\n\n*   **A careful point** is to recognize that a strong base like OH⁻ will neutralize all available acidic protons, regardless of whether they come from a strong acid (like HCl) or a weak acid (like CH₃COOH). Therefore, we sum the moles of all acidic species.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nNow, we compare the two. Since the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol), the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total base moles - Total acid moles\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final pH of the solution.**\n\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base.\n*   **A careful point** is to calculate the final total volume by summing the volumes of all three solutions.\n\n*   **Total Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n*   **A final careful point** is to calculate pOH first from the [OH⁻] and then convert to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH. A common mistake is to report the pOH value as the final answer.\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation, verified across all candidate answers and by independent analysis, consistently yields a pH of **12.62**. The value of 1.38 is the pOH, which is a common distractor in such problems.\n\nMatching the result to the provided options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 1.38 (Incorrect, this is the pOH)\nC) 8.68\nD) 12.62 (Correct)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a multi-step calculation to find the pH of a solution created by mixing a strong acid, a weak acid, and a strong base. An analysis of the reasoning provided by the various agents shows a strong consensus on the calculation method, despite inconsistencies in their final letter choices. The correct procedure is detailed below, highlighting key points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles of All Reactants**\nThe first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of each acid and base being mixed.\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    `Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    HCl is a strong acid that fully dissociates.\n    `Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol`\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that fully dissociates to yield two OH⁻ ions for each unit.\n    `Moles = Molarity × Volume × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.180 mol`\n\n**2. Perform Stoichiometric Neutralization**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. To find the excess reactant, we compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n*   **Total Moles of Acid:**\n    `Total Acid = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol`\n*   **Total Moles of Base:**\n    `Total Base = Moles(OH⁻) = 0.180 mol`\n\nComparing the two, the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130). Thus, the final solution will be basic due to an excess of hydroxide ions.\n*   **Moles of Excess OH⁻:**\n    `Excess OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol`\n\n**3. Calculate Final Concentration and pH**\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base in the final total volume of the solution.\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    `Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L`\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    `[OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M`\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    First, we calculate the pOH from the hydroxide concentration.\n    `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38`\n    Then, we use the relationship `pH + pOH = 14`.\n    `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62`\n\n### **Careful Points and Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** It is essential to remember that Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻ per mole of the compound. Failing to multiply by two is a common error.\n*   **pH vs. pOH:** After finding the excess [OH⁻], the calculated value of -log([OH⁻]) gives the pOH. A frequent mistake is to report this value (1.38) as the pH. This value is present as option A and serves as a distractor. The question asks for pH, which requires subtracting the pOH from 14.\n*   **Excess Reactant:** Since a strong base is in excess, the final pH is determined solely by its concentration. The presence of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) has a negligible effect on the pH compared to the strong base.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe detailed calculation robustly yields a pH of **12.62**. All candidate agents' reasoning sections correctly performed these steps and arrived at this numerical value. The inconsistencies in their final letter choices suggest they may have been presented with differently ordered options. Based on the option list provided in this question, the calculated value of 12.62 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem involving an acid-base neutralization reaction. A step-by-step analysis is required to find the final pH. Based on the analysis of all candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation method, but some confusion in selecting the final lettered option. The following breakdown confirms the correct numerical answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\nThis is the foundational step.

This is a frequent point of error.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol of OH⁻**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acid and base to find the excess reactant.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid:**\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Sum all sources of acid.\n    *   Total Acid = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):**\n    *   **0.180 mol**\n*   **Compare and find the excess:**\n    *   Since Moles of Base (0.180) > Moles of Acid (0.130), the base is in excess. The final solution will be basic.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total OH⁻ - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final concentration of the excess species.**\n\nThe concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Do not forget to sum the volumes of all three solutions.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Excess moles of OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final pH.**\n\nSince we have the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions, we first calculate the pOH.\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The most common mistake is to report the pOH (1.38) as the final answer. The question asks for pH. At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a pH of **12.62**.

This is a critical detail.\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol**\n\n2.  **Determine the excess reactant.**\n    To find out what remains after neutralization, we compare the total moles of acid (protons that can be neutralized) with the total moles of base (hydroxide ions).\n    *   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n        *   Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n    *   **Comparison:** Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130), the final solution will be basic due to an excess of strong base.\n    *   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n        *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n    The pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the total volume of the solution.\n    *   **Total volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   **Final concentration of OH⁻:**\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** The pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:** In an aqueous solution at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation, confirmed by a consistent analysis of the candidate answers' reasoning, shows the final pH of the solution is **12.62**. The value of 1.38 is the pOH, a common distractor in such problems.\n\nMatching the calculated pH with the given options:\nA) 8.68\nB) 1.38\nC) 12.62\nD) 8.92\n\nThe correct answer is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Analysis of the problem and key principles:**\n\nThe goal is to determine the final pH of a solution created by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The solution involves a straightforward acid-base neutralization calculation. The correct procedure, as unanimously agreed upon in the reasoning of all provided candidate answers, is as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\nThis is the starting point for any stoichiometry problem.\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   As a strong acid, HCl completely dissociates.\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol H⁺**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to provide two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻). This is a critical detail.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the excess species after neutralization.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n*   **Total moles of acid:**\n    *   Sum of H⁺ from HCl + moles of CH3COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):** **0.180 mol**\n\nBy comparing the totals, we see that the moles of base are greater than the moles of acid.\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻:**\n    *   Total OH⁻ - Total acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final pH is dominated by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻). The hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The final concentration is calculated using the total volume of the mixture.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The concentration of OH⁻ is used to calculate pOH first. A common mistake is to report the pOH value as the final answer.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculation, verified through step-by-step analysis and confirmed by the reasoning in all provided candidate answers, consistently yields a pH of **12.62**. The value 1.38 is the pOH, which is a common distractor in such problems.
