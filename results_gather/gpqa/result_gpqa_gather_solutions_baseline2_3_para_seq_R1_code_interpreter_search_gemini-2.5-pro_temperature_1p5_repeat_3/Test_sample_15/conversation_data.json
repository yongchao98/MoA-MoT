A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The question specifies particular stereoisomers for several compounds (e.g., using R/S or Z notation), so we evaluate the chirality of that specific isomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule serves as an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. By naming a specific enantiomer of a complex molecule (that is not a meso compound), we are discussing a pure chiral substance. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), and the substituents on each are identical (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion). Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal symmetry elements. It is a chiral molecule whose mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, a hydrogen atom, the `-CH2-CH=` portion of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` portion of the ring. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. It is therefore **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is achiral. For example, the all-cis isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: We search for a chiral center in the structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other chiral elements are present. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is 3. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe task is to determine how many of the seven given compounds are optically active. An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally requires the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at two specific stereocenters. When a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is named (and it is not a meso compound, which is evident from its complex, asymmetric structure), it is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), and the substituents on both centers are identical (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes the *meso* form of this compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion). Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks any internal symmetry elements and is chiral. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, which is non-superimposable. As a specific, single enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring due to the double bond's position. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is highly symmetrical. Both of its stereoisomers (all-cis and cis-trans) possess planes of symmetry. For instance, the all-cis isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through any C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. Due to the presence of these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An inspection of the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` reveals no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must analyze each one to see if it is chiral.

All agents agree.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), but they are identically substituted. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**. All agents agree.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound.

A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. For named compounds, the presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or a specific named enantiomer, indicates chirality, provided the molecule isn't a meso compound.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms directly involved in and attached to the double bond are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. **Result: Optically Inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name explicitly includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. Naming a specific enantiomer like this indicates the molecule is chiral (it is a complex, unsymmetrical structure and not a meso compound). A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active. **Result: Optically Active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) with identical substituents (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). When such a molecule has opposite configurations at its stereocenters (`R` and `S`), it results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making it achiral despite the presence of chiral centers. **Result: Optically Inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal element of symmetry. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. It is therefore a chiral molecule. The name specifies a single enantiomer. **Result: Optically Active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -H, 2) -OH, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule. **Result: Optically Active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: Regardless of the specific stereoisomer (all-cis or cis,trans), this symmetrically substituted cyclohexane possesses at least one plane of symmetry. For example, the all-cis isomer has three planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. **Result: Optically Inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An inspection of the structure reveals no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral. **Result: Optically Inactive.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis shows that there are three optically active compounds in the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, the total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n**Matching with Options:**\nThe options are:\nA) 3\nB) 4\nC) 2\nD) 5\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option A. All candidate answers unanimously concluded that there are 3 optically active compounds, even though they were inconsistent in selecting the correct letter.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.

This notation specifies the absolute configuration at specific chiral centers. The naming of a single, specific enantiomer indicates that the substance is a pure chiral compound (and not a racemic mixture).\n    *   **Result**: Optically **Active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule possesses two stereocenters (C2 and C3) that are identically substituted. The `(2R,3S)` configuration denotes a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a center of inversion, in this case), making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Result**: Optically Inactive (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Result**: Optically **Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Result**: Optically **Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is achiral. All its possible stereoisomers (all-cis and cis-trans) possess planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Result**: Optically Inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. An inspection of the molecule reveals no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butan-1-one chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Result**: Optically Inactive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.

A compound will be optically active if it is chiral and present in a non-racemic form (e.g., as a pure enantiomer).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of optically active compounds.\n\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer or in an enriched enantiomeric form (i.e., not a 50:50 racemic mixture). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The use of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or naming a specific isomer indicates we are evaluating a pure sample of that isomer.\n\n**1. Analysis of each compound:**\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule serves as an internal plane of symmetry. Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name explicitly includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which define the absolute configuration at specific chiral centers. The molecule itself is complex and lacks symmetry. Naming a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule means a pure sample is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) with identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion) that makes it achiral, despite containing stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Active.**\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and the two different paths around the ring containing the double bond. It is therefore a stereocenter.

Regardless of the exact conformation or relative stereochemistry (cis/trans), it will possess a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically Inactive.**\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: We search for a chiral center. The carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no other stereocenters in the molecule.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The question specifies particular stereoisomers for several compounds (e.g., using R/S or Z notation), so we evaluate the chirality of that specific isomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule serves as an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. By naming a specific enantiomer of a complex molecule (that is not a meso compound), we are discussing a pure chiral substance. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), and the substituents on each are identical (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion). Meso compounds are **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal symmetry elements. It is a chiral molecule whose mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, a hydrogen atom, the `-CH2-CH=` portion of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` portion of the ring. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. It is therefore **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is achiral. For example, the all-cis isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through any C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: We search for a chiral center in the structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other chiral elements are present. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThe total number of optically active compounds is 3. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe task is to determine how many of the seven given compounds are optically active. An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally requires the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at two specific stereocenters. When a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is named (and it is not a meso compound, which is evident from its complex, asymmetric structure), it is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), and the substituents on both centers are identical (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes the *meso* form of this compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion). Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks any internal symmetry elements and is chiral. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, which is non-superimposable. As a specific, single enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring due to the double bond's position. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is highly symmetrical. Both of its stereoisomers (all-cis and cis-trans) possess planes of symmetry. For instance, the all-cis isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through any C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. Due to the presence of these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An inspection of the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` reveals no stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 of the butanone chain is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.

The core of the question is to identify which compounds are chiral and are specified in a way that implies a non-racemic mixture (e.g., as a single enantiomer). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a step-by-step evaluation of each compound, integrating the consensus from the candidate answers:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The plane containing the carbon-carbon double bond acts as a plane of symmetry for the whole molecule. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive**. There is universal agreement among all agents on this point.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at chiral centers. The name refers to a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically active**. There is universal agreement on this.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule possesses two stereocenters with identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral due to an internal element of symmetry, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive**. There is universal agreement on this.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore a chiral molecule. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically active**. There is universal agreement on this.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, and two different pathways around the ring). The name specifies the single `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically active**. There is universal agreement on this.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is achiral. Regardless of whether it is the all-cis isomer or another stereoisomer, it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive**. There is universal agreement on this.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An inspection of the structure shows no stereocenters. The carbon in the isopropyl group (`CH(CH₃)₂`) is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Optically inactive**. There is universal agreement on this.\n\n**Final Tally:**\nThe compounds that are optically active are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis gives a total of **3** optically active compounds. According to the options provided in the prompt, a count of 3 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\nThe task is to determine which of the listed compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The given names often specify a single stereoisomer, which is crucial for the analysis.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the `C=C` double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This planarity creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule. It also lacks any chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**. There is a universal consensus on this point among all provided answers.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at two specific chiral centers. When a name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound (and it's not a meso compound), a pure sample is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**. There is a universal consensus on this point.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule possesses two stereocenters (at C2 and C3), which have identical substituents (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). When the configurations are opposite (`R` and `S`), this results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**. There is a universal consensus on this point.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have any internal symmetry elements. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. Therefore, the molecule is chiral, and the name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**. There is a universal consensus on this point.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter because it is bonded to four different groups: `-H`, `-OH`, and the two different paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=CH-` vs. `-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-`). The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically active**. There is a universal consensus on this point.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane molecule is achiral regardless of its stereoisomeric form. Both the all-cis isomer and the other diastereomer (one group trans to the other two) possess at least one plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**. There is a universal consensus on this point.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Analysis**: We check the molecule for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is the `CH` carbon at position 3, but it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Optically inactive**. There is a universal consensus on this point.\n\n**Summary and Final Count:**\n\nThe following compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTotal number of optically active compounds = **3**.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options:\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 2\nD) 4\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
