Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physics Principles**\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of luminosity ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the required physical laws:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. Here, $R$ is the star's radius, $T$ is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). That is, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light from a moving object is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength. For a velocity ($v$) much less than the speed of light ($c$), the relationship is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFollowing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis step immediately tells us that if the temperatures were equal, the ratio would be exactly 2.25. The temperature correction will adjust this value.\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, and all valid candidate answers follow this logic:\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* (rest-frame) wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}}$.\n*   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   We use the Doppler effect to relate observed and intrinsic wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, its velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so there's no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, its velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   To find the temperature ratio, we rearrange to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation from Step 3:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $\n\nNow, inserting the numerical values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s), the calculation gives the precise value of **2.2291219...**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.229. Rounding to two decimal places gives **2.23**. A logical check confirms this: since Star_1 is effectively cooler than Star_2 (due to the Doppler effect observation), the luminosity ratio must be slightly *less* than the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. Option C (~2.23) is the only choice that fits this logic. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed.\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of 2.23 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. To find this, we need to use the given physical properties and relevant laws of physics.\n\n**2. Core Physical Principles and Formulation**\n\nThe solution requires three key principles:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star behaving as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of luminosities for two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. This means the temperature ratio can be expressed as:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $$\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of a moving source is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength. For a source with radial velocity $v$ (positive when moving away), the relationship is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Step 1: Use the Radius Ratio.**\n    We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Plugging this into the luminosity ratio formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The information about mass ($M_1=1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a black body and should be ignored.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the most critical part, as it involves the Doppler effect.\n    1.  We know that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    2.  For Star_1, its radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. Therefore, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    3.  For Star_2, its radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler redshifted (shifted to longer wavelengths), so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Now, we rearrange to find the ratio needed for our temperature equation:\n        $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n    6.  Substituting this into the temperature ratio equation from Wien's Law gives:\n        $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** A common mistake is to assume the temperatures are the same because the observed wavelengths are the same. This is incorrect. For the redshifted Star_2 to have the same observed wavelength as the stationary Star_1, its intrinsic wavelength must have been shorter (bluer), meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter than Star_1 ($T_2 > T_1$). Our derived formula correctly shows that the ratio $T_1/T_2$ is less than 1.\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Calculation.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Using the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} $$\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**4.

The temperature ratio term was derived as $\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Combining these factors, we get $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$.

Breakdown of the Physics**\n\nTo solve this problem, three key physical principles must be combined:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This law establishes the relationship between a star's luminosity, its radius ($R$), and its surface temperature ($T$).\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength of its emission ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). That is, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$. This allows us to relate the temperatures of the two stars to their intrinsic properties.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The wavelength of light we observe from a star ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the star is moving relative to us. For a star moving away with velocity $v$, the observed wavelength is redshifted according to the formula $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### **2.

Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) of two stars. The solution requires the application of three core principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area ($4\\pi R^2$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T$). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its own reference frame. Thus, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light from a moving object is shifted relative to its intrinsic wavelength. For an object moving with radial velocity $v$, the observed wavelength is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$. Substituting this value gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most crucial step, requiring the connection between the observed wavelength and the intrinsic temperature.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$ km/s), there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is Doppler redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed for the temperature calculation:\n        $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n\n### **3. Synthesize and Calculate**\n\nNow, substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n\nThe executed Python code confirmed the numerical result of this calculation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **4. Analysis and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Numerical Result:** The calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.2291, which rounds to **2.23**.\n*   **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's, its intrinsic wavelength must be shorter, meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). Therefore, the final luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) must be less than the contribution from the radii alone (which is 2.25). Among the choices, only ~2.23 fits this criterion.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is extraneous information not used in the black-body luminosity calculation.\n*   **Consensus:** The provided candidate answers that show a correct derivation all arrive at the same numerical result of ~2.229. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) are due to different randomized orderings of the multiple-choice options in the question they each received. The underlying calculation is consistent and sound.\n\nBased on the prompt's options (A) ~2.35, B) ~2.25, C) ~2.23, D) ~2.32), the calculated value of ~2.23 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics problem reveals the following:\n\n**1. Derivation of the Correct Formula**\n\n*   **Luminosity:** The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Squaring this gives $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. So, the formula becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature is related to the intrinsic peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by Wien's Law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$). This means $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect.

The physics is sound and points to one conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and the numerical result, even if the final letter choice varies due to differences in how the options were presented to each agent. Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### **1. Core Physics Principles**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the necessary laws of physics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's luminosity ($L$) is proportional to its radius squared ($R^2$) and its temperature to the fourth power ($T^4$). The ratio of luminosities is therefore $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), so $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** A star's *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) by its radial velocity ($v_r$). For speeds much less than the speed of light, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v_r/c)$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThe candidates' reasoning converges on the following correct derivation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Setup:** Start with the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n2.  **Substitute Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The formula becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n3.  **Determine Temperature Ratio:** This is the most critical part.\n    *   We need the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$, which is equal to $\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there's no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), there is a redshift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$. Because Star_2 is moving away, its light must be intrinsically \"bluer\" (hotter) for its redshifted observed color to match that of the stationary Star_1.\n\n4.  **Final Formula:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the main equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$\n\n### **3. Numerical Calculation**\nThe final step is to compute the value. The provided code execution confirms the numerical result.\nThe code output `2.2291075611484996` is the result of the calculation:\n$ \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 700000/299792458)^4} $\nThis result, rounded to two decimal places, is **2.23**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Answer**\n*   The analysis shows near-unanimous agreement on the physical derivation and the final numerical result of **~2.23**.\n*   The extraneous information about the stars' masses is correctly ignored by all methods.\n*   The discrepancies in the final letter choices of the candidate answers are likely due to the randomization of the option letters during testing, not errors in the physics.\n*   The calculated value must be matched against the options provided in the original question:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.23 matches option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles**\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$). This problem requires the application of three core physics concepts:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is a physical constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body ($T$) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). That is, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light is shifted from its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the source is moving. The formula for this shift is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$, where $v$ is the radial velocity away from the observer and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis step is correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\nPlugging this into the equation gives:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis indicates that without any temperature difference, the ratio would be 2.25. The extraneous information about the mass is correctly ignored by all analyses.\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem and where all three principles must be combined.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n*   The problem's crucial condition is that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   We use the Doppler effect to relate the observed and emitted wavelengths for each star:\n    *   For Star_1, its velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, its velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal to each other: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\nThis entire derivation is agreed upon by all the candidate answers. It logically means that Star 1 is slightly cooler than Star 2.\n\n**5. Synthesize and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow, substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $\nTo get the final value, we plug in the numbers:\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$\n\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + \\frac{700}{300000})^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $\n\n**6. Final Decision**\n\nThe numerical result of the calculation, agreed upon by every candidate that showed their work, is approximately **2.229**. Rounding this to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options in the prompt:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.23 directly corresponds to option B. While several candidate answers selected different letters, this was due to different (likely randomized) orderings of the options in their respective contexts. The physical reasoning and mathematical result are overwhelmingly consistent and point to a single value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\nThe main goal is to compute the ratio of luminosities, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars given their physical properties.\n\n*   **Star Properties:**\n    *   $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$ (Radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2)\n    *   $v_1 = 0$ km/s (Radial velocity of Star 1 is zero)\n    *   $v_2 = 700$ km/s (Radial velocity of Star 2)\n*   **Key Observations:**\n    *   The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.\n    *   Their *observed* wavelengths of peak brightness are identical ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the luminosity calculation for black bodies and can be ignored.\n\n### **2. Core Physics Principles**\nThe solution requires applying three fundamental physical laws:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity to radius ($R$) and temperature ($T$).\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), meaning $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. This connects temperature to the light emitted by the star in its own reference frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the *intrinsic* wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the star's motion. For a star moving away from us, the non-relativistic approximation is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThis derivation synthesizes the correct reasoning demonstrated by the majority of the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the Radius Ratio.**\n    Given that $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, we square this value: $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    This step shows that if the temperatures were equal, the answer would be 2.25. The temperature difference will modify this value.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the crucial step that involves Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We use the fact that the *observed* wavelengths are equal ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n    *   For Star 1, with $v_1 = 0$, there's no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Calculation.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Now, plug in the values: $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$ and $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$.\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\n1.  **Logical Check:** As shown in Step 2, without a Doppler effect, the ratio would be 2.25. The Doppler effect for the receding Star 2 means it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$) to appear the same temperature as Star 1. A lower temperature for Star 1 ($T_1$) means the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1, so the final luminosity ratio must be slightly *less than* 2.25.

    "An analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics problem reveals a clear and consistent method for arriving at the correct solution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    This is the most critical step and requires combining Wien's Displacement Law with the Doppler Effect.\n    *   Wien's Law states that a star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) are identical for both stars: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   The Doppler Effect relates the observed wavelength to the intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n        *   For Star_1, with $v_1=0$, there is no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   For Star_2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set them equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to get the required ratio for our temperature calculation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The information about the stars' masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation and should be ignored. All correct candidate analyses did this.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength**: The most common potential mistake is to assume that because the *observed* wavelengths are identical, the temperatures must also be identical. The correct approach, as shown by the candidates, is to use the Doppler effect to find the *intrinsic* wavelengths, which are what truly determine the stars' temperatures.\n*   **Logical Check**: Since Star 2 is receding, its light is redshifted to a longer wavelength. For it to be *observed* at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its *intrinsic* wavelength must be shorter (bluer), meaning it is hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). This implies that the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1. Consequently, the final luminosity ratio must be slightly **less than** 2.25. Of the given choices, only ~2.23 satisfies this condition, providing a quick way to validate the answer.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: Every candidate answer that followed the correct physical principles arrived at the same numerical result of ~2.229. The inconsistencies in the final letter chosen (A, B, C, etc.) are due to the different, randomized ordering of the options in each agent's specific prompt. The underlying physics and calculation are unambiguously agreed upon.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation yields a value of ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**.

Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physics Principles**\nThe problem requires calculating the ratio of luminosity ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the required physical laws:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. Here, $R$ is the star's radius, $T$ is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). That is, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light from a moving object is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength. For a velocity ($v$) much less than the speed of light ($c$), the relationship is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFollowing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis step immediately tells us that if the temperatures were equal, the ratio would be exactly 2.25. The temperature correction will adjust this value.\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, and all valid candidate answers follow this logic:\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* (rest-frame) wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}}$.\n*   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   We use the Doppler effect to relate observed and intrinsic wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1, its velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so there's no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, its velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   To find the temperature ratio, we rearrange to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation from Step 3:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $\n\nNow, inserting the numerical values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s), the calculation gives the precise value of **2.2291219...**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.229. Rounding to two decimal places gives **2.23**. A logical check confirms this: since Star_1 is effectively cooler than Star_2 (due to the Doppler effect observation), the luminosity ratio must be slightly *less* than the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. Option C (~2.23) is the only choice that fits this logic. The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed.\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value of 2.23 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. To find this, we need to use the given physical properties and relevant laws of physics.\n\n**2. Core Physical Principles and Formulation**\n\nThe solution requires three key principles:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star behaving as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of luminosities for two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. This means the temperature ratio can be expressed as:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $$\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of a moving source is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength. For a source with radial velocity $v$ (positive when moving away), the relationship is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Step 1: Use the Radius Ratio.**\n    We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Plugging this into the luminosity ratio formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The information about mass ($M_1=1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a black body and should be ignored.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the most critical part, as it involves the Doppler effect.\n    1.  We know that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    2.  For Star_1, its radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. Therefore, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    3.  For Star_2, its radial velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s. Its light is Doppler redshifted (shifted to longer wavelengths), so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Now, we rearrange to find the ratio needed for our temperature equation:\n        $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n    6.  Substituting this into the temperature ratio equation from Wien's Law gives:\n        $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** A common mistake is to assume the temperatures are the same because the observed wavelengths are the same. This is incorrect. For the redshifted Star_2 to have the same observed wavelength as the stationary Star_1, its intrinsic wavelength must have been shorter (bluer), meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter than Star_1 ($T_2 > T_1$). Our derived formula correctly shows that the ratio $T_1/T_2$ is less than 1.\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Calculation.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Using the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} $$\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**4.

Breakdown of the Physics**\n\nTo solve this problem, three key physical principles must be combined:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This law establishes the relationship between a star's luminosity, its radius ($R$), and its surface temperature ($T$).\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength of its emission ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). That is, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$. This allows us to relate the temperatures of the two stars to their intrinsic properties.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The wavelength of light we observe from a star ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the star is moving relative to us. For a star moving away with velocity $v$, the observed wavelength is redshifted according to the formula $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\nFollowing the consensus logic present in the majority of the candidate answers:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities for Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:** We are given that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio term becomes $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    *Careful Point:* The information about the stars' masses is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most critical part, connecting the Doppler effect to the temperature.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star 1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set them equal to each other: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Plugging in the values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 700/300000)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **3.

Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) of two stars. The solution requires the application of three core principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star radiating as a black body is proportional to its surface area ($4\\pi R^2$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T$). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its own reference frame. Thus, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light from a moving object is shifted relative to its intrinsic wavelength. For an object moving with radial velocity $v$, the observed wavelength is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$. Substituting this value gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most crucial step, requiring the connection between the observed wavelength and the intrinsic temperature.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$ km/s), there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is Doppler redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed for the temperature calculation:\n        $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n\n### **3. Synthesize and Calculate**\n\nNow, substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n\nThe executed Python code confirmed the numerical result of this calculation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **4. Analysis and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Numerical Result:** The calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.2291, which rounds to **2.23**.\n*   **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed wavelength to match Star_1's, its intrinsic wavelength must be shorter, meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). Therefore, the final luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) must be less than the contribution from the radii alone (which is 2.25). Among the choices, only ~2.23 fits this criterion.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is extraneous information not used in the black-body luminosity calculation.\n*   **Consensus:** The provided candidate answers that show a correct derivation all arrive at the same numerical result of ~2.229. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) are due to different randomized orderings of the multiple-choice options in the question they each received. The underlying calculation is consistent and sound.\n\nBased on the prompt's options (A) ~2.35, B) ~2.25, C) ~2.23, D) ~2.32), the calculated value of ~2.23 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics problem reveals the following:\n\n**1. Derivation of the Correct Formula**\n\n*   **Luminosity:** The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Luminosity Ratio:** The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Squaring this gives $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. So, the formula becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** The temperature is related to the intrinsic peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by Wien's Law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$). This means $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect. For Star 2 moving away from us at $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted.\n    $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c})$.\n    For Star 1 with $v_1 = 0$, its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n*   **Combining Wavelengths:** The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    Therefore, $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c})$.\n*   **Solving for Temperature Ratio:** We can rearrange the above to find the ratio needed for the temperature:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    Since $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$, we have:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   **Final Formula:** Substituting the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation gives:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4$.\n\n**2.

A review of the candidate answers shows a near-unanimous agreement on the physical derivation and the final numerical result of ~2.229, despite confusion over differing multiple-choice letter assignments. The physics is sound and points to one conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and the numerical result, even if the final letter choice varies due to differences in how the options were presented to each agent. Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### **1. Core Physics Principles**\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the necessary laws of physics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's luminosity ($L$) is proportional to its radius squared ($R^2$) and its temperature to the fourth power ($T^4$). The ratio of luminosities is therefore $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), so $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** A star's *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) by its radial velocity ($v_r$). For speeds much less than the speed of light, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v_r/c)$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThe candidates' reasoning converges on the following correct derivation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Setup:** Start with the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n2.  **Substitute Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The formula becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n3.  **Determine Temperature Ratio:** This is the most critical part.\n    *   We need the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$, which is equal to $\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there's no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), there is a redshift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$. Because Star_2 is moving away, its light must be intrinsically \"bluer\" (hotter) for its redshifted observed color to match that of the stationary Star_1.\n\n4.  **Final Formula:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the main equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$\n\n### **3. Numerical Calculation**\nThe final step is to compute the value. The provided code execution confirms the numerical result.\nThe code output `2.2291075611484996` is the result of the calculation:\n$ \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 700000/299792458)^4} $\nThis result, rounded to two decimal places, is **2.23**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Answer**\n*   The analysis shows near-unanimous agreement on the physical derivation and the final numerical result of **~2.23**.\n*   The extraneous information about the stars' masses is correctly ignored by all methods.\n*   The discrepancies in the final letter choices of the candidate answers are likely due to the randomization of the option letters during testing, not errors in the physics.\n*   The calculated value must be matched against the options provided in the original question:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.23 matches option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on a synthesis of the provided solutions.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Principles**\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$). This problem requires the application of three core physics concepts:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total luminosity ($L$) of a spherical star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is a physical constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body ($T$) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). That is, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light is shifted from its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the source is moving. The formula for this shift is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$, where $v$ is the radial velocity away from the observer and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis step is correctly identified by all candidate answers.\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\nPlugging this into the equation gives:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $\nThis indicates that without any temperature difference, the ratio would be 2.25. The extraneous information about the mass is correctly ignored by all analyses.\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem and where all three principles must be combined.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *emitted* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n*   The problem's crucial condition is that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   We use the Doppler effect to relate the observed and emitted wavelengths for each star:\n    *   For Star_1, its velocity is 0, so there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, its velocity is $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal to each other: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature calculation: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\nThis entire derivation is agreed upon by all the candidate answers. It logically means that Star 1 is slightly cooler than Star 2.\n\n**5. Synthesize and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nNow, substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $\nTo get the final value, we plug in the numbers:\n*   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$\n\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + \\frac{700}{300000})^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $\n\n**6. Final Decision**\n\nThe numerical result of the calculation, agreed upon by every candidate that showed their work, is approximately **2.229**. Rounding this to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\nMatching this result to the provided options in the prompt:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.23 directly corresponds to option B. While several candidate answers selected different letters, this was due to different (likely randomized) orderings of the options in their respective contexts. The physical reasoning and mathematical result are overwhelmingly consistent and point to a single value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\nThe main goal is to compute the ratio of luminosities, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars given their physical properties.\n\n*   **Star Properties:**\n    *   $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$ (Radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2)\n    *   $v_1 = 0$ km/s (Radial velocity of Star 1 is zero)\n    *   $v_2 = 700$ km/s (Radial velocity of Star 2)\n*   **Key Observations:**\n    *   The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies.\n    *   Their *observed* wavelengths of peak brightness are identical ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the luminosity calculation for black bodies and can be ignored.\n\n### **2. Core Physics Principles**\nThe solution requires applying three fundamental physical laws:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity to radius ($R$) and temperature ($T$).\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature of a black body ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), meaning $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. This connects temperature to the light emitted by the star in its own reference frame.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the *intrinsic* wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the star's motion. For a star moving away from us, the non-relativistic approximation is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThis derivation synthesizes the correct reasoning demonstrated by the majority of the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the Radius Ratio.**\n    Given that $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, we square this value: $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    This step shows that if the temperatures were equal, the answer would be 2.25. The temperature difference will modify this value.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the crucial step that involves Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We use the fact that the *observed* wavelengths are equal ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n    *   For Star 1, with $v_1 = 0$, there's no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio needed for the temperature: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Calculation.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 $$\n    Now, plug in the values: $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$ and $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$.\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **4. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\n1.  **Logical Check:** As shown in Step 2, without a Doppler effect, the ratio would be 2.25. The Doppler effect for the receding Star 2 means it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$) to appear the same temperature as Star 1. A lower temperature for Star 1 ($T_1$) means the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1, so the final luminosity ratio must be slightly *less than* 2.25. Reviewing the options:\n    *   A) ~2.25 (Incorrect; ignores Doppler effect)\n    *   B) ~2.32 (Incorrect; must be < 2.25)\n    *   C) ~2.23 (Correct; is slightly < 2.25)\n    *   D) ~2.35 (Incorrect; must be < 2.25)\n\n2.  **Numerical Calculation:** The calculation yields ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**.\n\n3.  **Candidate Consensus:** A vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly perform this derivation and calculation, arriving at the same numerical result of ~2.229. Any confusion in their final choice of letter is due to the options being shuffled in their versions of the question.\n\nBased on the physics, the logical deduction, and the numerical calculation, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis and calculation have been performed, and the provided code confirms the numerical result.\n\n1.  **Physics Principles:** The luminosity ratio is given by $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** Given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, this simplifies to $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** By combining Wien's Law ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$) and the Doppler Effect ($\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1+v/c)$) with the fact that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we derived the temperature ratio to be $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n4.  **Final Formula:** This gives the final formula for the luminosity ratio: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}$.\n5.  **Calculation:** The Python code executed this exact formula: `(1.5**2) / ((1 + 700 / 299792.458)**4)`.\n6.  **Result:** The output of the code is `2.2291075611484996`.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Rounding the result to two decimal places gives `2.23`.
