    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.** This reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. The product (1) is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide.** When 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after neutralization). Therefore, product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form an acyl chloride. This is a standard method for this conversion. The resulting product (3) is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O*t*-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol. Thus, the final product (4) is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in different electronic environments, which give rise to separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (H-C=O) is in a unique chemical environment. This accounts for **one** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The Ring Protons:** The carbon atom on the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center (it is attached to four different groups: the CHO group, an H atom, C2, and C5 of the ring). The presence of this chiral center means the molecule is asymmetric. In an achiral environment, all the other carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5) are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   **Proton on C1:** The single hydrogen attached to C1 is unique. This is a **second** type of hydrogen.\n    *   **Protons on C2, C3, C4, and C5:** Since C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on each of the adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups (C2 and C5) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct from each other. Similarly, the protons on C3 and C4 are also diastereotopic. Because the entire ring is rendered asymmetric by the C1 stereocenter, none of the methylene groups are equivalent to each other.\n        *   Protons on C2: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C3: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C4: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C5: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2-H₂: 2\n*   C3-H₂: 2\n*   C4-H₂: 2\n*   C5-H₂: 2\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\n<<<D>>>"
