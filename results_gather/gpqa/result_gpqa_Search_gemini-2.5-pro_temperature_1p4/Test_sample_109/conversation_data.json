    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two criteria for each star: its visibility from both observatories and whether its apparent brightness is within the detection limits of both instruments.\n\n### 1. Observatory Criteria\n\n*   **ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory:**\n    *   Location: Atacama Desert, Chile.\n    *   Latitude: Approximately 24.6° South.\n    *   Visibility: Can observe stars with declinations roughly between +65° and -90°.\n    *   Brightness Limit: Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17.0.\n\n*   **HIRES at W. M. Keck Observatory:**\n    *   Location: Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA.\n    *   Latitude: Approximately 19.8° North.\n    *   Visibility: Can observe stars with declinations roughly between -70° and +90°.\n    *   Brightness Limit: Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16.0.\n\nFor a star to be observable by both, it must have a declination between approximately -70° and +65° and an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16.0 (the stricter of the two limits).\n\n### 2. Star Analysis\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d) in parsecs, and extinction (A_V) using the formula:\n*m_V = M_V + 5log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V*\nThe extinction in the V-band (A_V) is calculated as 3.1 times the color excess E(B-V).\n\n---\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -75°. This declination is too far south to be visible from Keck Observatory (limit ≈ -70°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 55°. Visible from both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):** Given as 16.5 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m_V < 17.0): Yes (16.5 < 17.0)\n    *   HIRES (m_V < 16.0): No (16.5 is not less than 16.0)\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 48°. Visible from both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude (m_V):** The information provided is \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag\". Assuming the intended value for the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m_V < 17.0): Yes (15.5 < 17.0)\n    *   HIRES (m_V < 16.0): Yes (15.5 < 16.0)\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -48°. Visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute V Magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   Apparent V Magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m_V < 17.0): Yes (16.74 < 17.0)\n    *   HIRES (m_V < 16.0): No (16.74 is not less than 16.0)\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 60°. Visible from both observatories.\n*   **Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute V Magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 0 (not specified)\n    *   Apparent V Magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (m_V < 17.0): Yes (14.995 < 17.0)\n    *   HIRES (m_V < 16.0): Yes (14.995 < 16.0)\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be observed by both.\n\n### Final Result\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
