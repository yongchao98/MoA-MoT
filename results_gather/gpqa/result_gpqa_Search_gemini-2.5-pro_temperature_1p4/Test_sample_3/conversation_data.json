    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles), two of Maxwell's equations would be different to account for these new phenomena. The existence of magnetic monopoles would make the equations more symmetric.\n\nThe two affected equations would be:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0). This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic monopoles have never been observed. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or \"sinks\" of the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges are sources of the electric field. The equation would be changed to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is equal to the magnetic charge density (ρm).\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a flow of these monopoles would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would also create a circulating electric field, so a new term would be added to Faraday's Law to account for it.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is the one that identifies changes to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<C>>>"
