    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the fundamental symmetries of the underlying framework of quantum field theory upon which the SM itself is built.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. All operators are constructed to be scalars under Lorentz transformations, meaning they respect this symmetry. This is a foundational requirement for the theory to be consistent with the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry:** This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) with spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré invariance is a fundamental assumption in the construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the symmetry under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, notably in the quark sector. SMEFT is a framework that allows for additional sources of CP violation from new physics at high energies. There is extensive research on classifying the numerous possible CP-violating operators within SMEFT. Therefore, CP symmetry is explicitly *not* a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant theory must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). As SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, all its operators must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on this, Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. CP symmetry does not.\n\n<<<A>>>"
