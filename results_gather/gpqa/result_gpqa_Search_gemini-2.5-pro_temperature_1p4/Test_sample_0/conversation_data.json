    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the sum of the energy uncertainties of each level. This principle is derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of a quantum state to its lifetime (Δt or τ). The relationship is often expressed as:\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A finite lifetime means a state's energy is not perfectly defined but has a \"smear\" or \"linewidth\". The natural linewidth (Γ), which represents the inherent uncertainty in energy, is related to the lifetime (τ) by Γ = ħ/τ.\n\nTo resolve two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their combined linewidths. A conservative condition is that the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (linewidths):\n|E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State\n\nFirst, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s), which is convenient as the answer options are in eV.\n*   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each quantum state.\n\n**For the first state (E1):**\n*   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n*   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state (E2):**\n*   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n*   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Required Energy Difference\n\nTo clearly distinguish the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties:\n*   Required Energy Difference > ΔE1 + ΔE2\n*   Required Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Required Energy Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Required Energy Difference > 7.2402 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nThe shorter-lived state (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s) has a significantly larger energy uncertainty (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), which is the dominant factor.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Given Options\n\nWe must find the option that represents an energy difference greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV\n\nLet's compare:\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides a sufficient energy separation to clearly resolve the two energy levels.\n\n<<<A>>>"
