    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a net charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conductor shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside it. The conducting material ensures that the electric field within the conductor itself is zero. Consequently, the distribution of charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Uniform Distribution:** Due to the spherical shape of the outer conductor, and because there are no other external charges, the induced charge `+q` will spread itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a spherically uniform charge distribution is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the electric field is equivalent to that of a single point charge `+q` located at the center of the large spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`. The parameters `r`, `s`, `l`, and `Î¸` describe the cavity's and the charge's position, but they are irrelevant for calculating the field outside due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
