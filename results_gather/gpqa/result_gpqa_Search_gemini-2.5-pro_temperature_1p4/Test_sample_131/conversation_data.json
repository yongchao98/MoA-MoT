    "To solve this problem, we must determine the 1H NMR spectral characteristics for each potential compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Analysis of Individual Compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal (a singlet) for 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also equivalent due to symmetry. This gives one signal (a singlet) for all 12 methyl protons.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* One aromatic singlet (2H) and one alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This gives one signal (a singlet) for 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent to each other, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals (both singlets). One signal integrates to 6 protons (for Me-1 and Me-4), and the other also integrates to 6 protons (for Me-2 and Me-3).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* One aromatic singlet (2H) and two alkyl singlets (6H each, 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This leads to two separate signals (both singlets), each integrating to 1 proton.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H), while the methyl group at 2 (3H) and the methyl group at 5 (3H) are each unique. This results in three separate signals (all singlets) with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* Two aromatic singlets (1H each, 1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H -> 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, giving one signal (a singlet) for 4 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. However, within an ethyl group, the -CH2- protons are different from the -CH3 protons and they split each other. This gives a quartet for the 4 -CH2- protons and a triplet for the 6 -CH3 protons. There are no singlets from the alkyl groups.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* One aromatic singlet (4H), one alkyl quartet (4H), and one alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n**Evaluating the Mixture Options:**\n\nThe observed spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the proposed pairs:\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-isomer). This would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which contradicts the data.\n*   Alkyl signals: One 12H singlet and three other singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This would give four signals, not three.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic signals:** The 1,2,4,5-isomer provides one 2H singlet. The 1,2,3,4-isomer also provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two non-equivalent singlets will appear as **two signals of equal integration (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the observation.\n*   **Alkyl signals:** The 1,2,4,5-isomer provides one 12H singlet. The 1,2,3,4-isomer provides two 6H singlets. The combination will show **three singlets** in total. The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the observation.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-isomer) and two 1H singlets (from 1,2,3,5-isomer). This gives a total of three signals (ratio 2:1:1), which is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n*   Alkyl signals: 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet, but the problem states only singlets are observed in the alkyl region. This option is incorrect.\n\nThe only combination that matches the described NMR data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
