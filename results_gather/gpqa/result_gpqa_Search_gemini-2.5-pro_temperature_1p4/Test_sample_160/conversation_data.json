    "Based on an analysis of the physical principles governing particle interactions, we can conclude the relationship between the mean free path of gas molecules (λ1) and the mean free path of high-energy electrons (λ2).\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas-Gas Mean Free Path):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This interaction is governed by the kinetic size of the molecules. The formula for this is approximately λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas), where 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules and σ_gas is their collision cross-section. The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in motion.\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Gas Mean Free Path):** This is the average distance a high-energy electron (1000 kV) travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. The formula for this is approximately λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_electron), where σ_electron is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule. Since the electron is moving at a velocity vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered stationary, and the √2 factor is not used.\n\nThe key to comparing λ1 and λ2 lies in comparing their respective collision cross-sections, σ_gas and σ_electron.\n\n*   **Collision Cross-Section:** A collision cross-section represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for an interaction. A larger cross-section means a collision is more likely, which in turn leads to a shorter mean free path.\n\n*   **Comparison:** A 1000 kV (1 MeV) electron is an extremely high-energy, point-like particle. For it to be significantly scattered, it must pass very close to the atomic nucleus of a gas molecule. The atom is mostly empty space to such a high-energy particle. In contrast, the collision between two gas molecules is an interaction between their much larger electron clouds. Consequently, the effective collision cross-section for a high-energy electron (σ_electron) is significantly smaller than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules (σ_gas).\n\nSince the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), a much smaller cross-section for the electron-gas interaction results in a much longer mean free path. Therefore, λ2 will be significantly larger than λ1.\n\nConsidering the given options:\n*   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This option indicates that λ2 is greater than λ1, which aligns with our physical reasoning.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This option suggests that λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1, which contradicts the significant difference we expect.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1: This is incorrect as the interacting particles and energies are different.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1: This would incorrectly imply that a high-energy electron is more likely to collide than a gas molecule.\n\nThe most physically accurate conclusion is that λ2 is substantially greater than λ1. Option A is the only one that reflects this reality by setting a lower bound and allowing for λ2 to be much larger.\n\n<<<A>>>"
