    "An analysis of each compound for optical activity is required. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. Chirality is most often caused by the presence of one or more stereocenters, and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make the molecule superimposable on its mirror image (a meso compound).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has the structure Cl-CH=C(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The plane containing the C=C double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors \"(3aR,7aS)\". These R/S designations indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific three-dimensional arrangement. Naming a specific enantiomer like this implies the compound is chiral and a pure sample of it will be optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The (2R, 3S) designation indicates that the two chiral centers have opposite configurations. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule (the groups on C2 are the same as on C3), this specific diastereomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. In the (2R,3R) isomer, the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and its enantiomer is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" in the name indicates that the molecule is a specific enantiomer. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a vinyl group within the ring (-CH=CH-), and an alkyl group within the ring (-CH₂-CH₂-). As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all cis). This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one of the C-OH bonds and the opposing C-H bond on the other side of the ring. Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. To determine if it is chiral, we look for stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione is **active**.\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **active**.\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is **active**.\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
