    "For a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, the energy eigenvalues are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThe degeneracy, or the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $E_n$, is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\nThe possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3 are:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: 3 states\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: 6 states\n*   (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10, which confirms the degeneracy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
