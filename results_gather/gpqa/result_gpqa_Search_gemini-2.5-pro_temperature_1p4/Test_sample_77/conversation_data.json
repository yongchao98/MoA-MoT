    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic signals propagate at the finite speed of light, c.\n\nThe potential measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge *q* at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*. The relationship between the observation time and the retarded time is given by $t - t_r = d/c$, where *d* is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{d}$ from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n- **Scalar Potential (V):** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n- **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):** $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\nThese can be rewritten by factoring out *c* from the denominator:\n- **Scalar Potential (V):** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n- **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):** $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nIt's also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential is related to the scalar potential and the charge's velocity by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$.\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options, option D is the correct match.\n\n<<<D>>>"
