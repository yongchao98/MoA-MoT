    "This is a classic problem in special relativity that involves the concepts of time dilation and particle decay. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The number of unstable particles, N, remaining after a time *t* follows an exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)`, where N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ is the mean lifetime of the particle. The fraction of particles that survive is `N/N₀`.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the detector (the lab frame), the lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is \"dilated\" or lengthened. This dilated lifetime, `τ_lab`, is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, γ. The formula is: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time it takes them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`, where R is the radius of the detector.\n\n### Solving the Problem\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector is given by `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ_lab)`.\n\nBy substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`, we get:\n\n`Fraction = e^(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n`ln(Fraction) = -R / (γ * c * τ_proper)`\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for this specific type of particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\n\nSo, `γ * ln(Fraction) = -K`.\n\n**Step 1: Use the initial conditions to find the constant K.**\n\n*   Detector Radius (R) = 30 m\n*   Initial Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n*   Initial fraction of surviving particles = 1/3\n\n`20 * ln(1/3) = -K`\n`20 * (-ln(3)) = -K`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Step 2: Use the final conditions to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂).**\n\n*   Detector Radius (R) = 30 m\n*   New fraction of surviving particles = 2/3\n*   New Lorentz factor (γ₂) = ?\n\n`γ₂ * ln(2/3) = -K`\n`γ₂ * ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3))`\n`γ₂ * (ln(2) - ln(3)) = -20 * ln(3)`\n`γ₂ * -(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -20 * ln(3)`\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
