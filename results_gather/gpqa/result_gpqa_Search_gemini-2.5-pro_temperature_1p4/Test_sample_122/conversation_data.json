    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. According to an observer in a stationary frame of reference (the Galaxy), a clock moving at a relativistic speed will appear to tick slower than a clock at rest in the stationary frame.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information**:\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's moving reference frame (proper time, Δt₀) is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light in a vacuum (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**: The Lorentz factor determines the extent of relativistic effects. The formula is:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n    *   First, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        (v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate the Lorentz factor:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96) ≈ 1.02062\n\n3.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt)**: This is the dilated time, which is longer than the proper time. The formula for time dilation is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.031 s\n\n4.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame**: To find the distance, we multiply the ejecta's velocity (as measured from the Galaxy's frame) by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    Distance = v * Δt\n\n    *   Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n    *   Distance ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options**:\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering relativistic effects)\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,860 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
