    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1. The probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\nThe wave function is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we calculate the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|²:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [Re(Ψ)]² + [Im(Ψ)]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density |Ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set the result to 1:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nThe first part of the integral is:\na² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3 = a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\nThe second part of the integral is:\n0.25 * [x] from 1 to 3 = 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\nSubstituting these results back into the equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
