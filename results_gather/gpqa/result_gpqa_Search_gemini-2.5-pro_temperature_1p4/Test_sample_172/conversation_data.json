    "To solve this problem, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant principles and given information:**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum:** This principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formula is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n    *   Velocity of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s.\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n**2. Relate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n\nSince the electron is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v/c ≈ (2x10⁸)/(3x10⁸) ≈ 0.67), we should use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nWhere:\n*   E is the total energy.\n*   p is the momentum.\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nTo find the relationship between the uncertainties, we can differentiate this equation:\n2E dE = 2c²p dp\nΔE = (c²p / E) Δp\n\nUsing the definitions of relativistic energy (E = γm₀c²) and relativistic momentum (p = γm₀v), we can simplify the expression:\nΔE = (c² * γm₀v) / (γm₀c²) * Δp\nΔE = v * Δp\n\nThis shows that the uncertainty in energy is directly proportional to the uncertainty in momentum, with the velocity as the constant of proportionality. This relationship holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\n\n**3. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n\nUsing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for the minimum uncertainty:\nΔp ≈ ħ / Δx\n\nSubstituting the known values:\nΔp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**4. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):**\n\nNow, use the relationship ΔE = v * Δp:\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (1.054 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 2.108 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options:**\n\nThe calculated value, approximately 2.1 x 10⁻¹⁶ J, is closest to the option ~10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
