    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch of a carboxylic acid (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is typically observed between 1680-1640 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl protons typically resonate in the range of 4.5-7.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula\n\n1.  **Functional Groups:** The combined spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests the presence of two key functional groups: a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and an **alkene** (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid, which contains two oxygen atoms, narrows down the possible formulas to C6H12O2 and C6H10O2.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The degree of unsaturation is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n    *   The carboxylic acid group contains one double bond (C=O), which accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The alkene group contains one double bond (C=C), which accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with the presence of both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence from all three characterization techniques, the unknown compound must contain a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires two degrees of unsaturation, a condition that only the molecular formula **C6H10O2** satisfies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
