    "An analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is crucial to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **Target Molecule Analysis**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThis is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. We need to consider the directing effects of these groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### **Evaluation of Synthetic Routes**\n\nThe key to forming a 1,3,5-substituted product with these groups is to introduce them in an order that leverages their directing effects to place the next substituent in the correct position. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) are notably ineffective on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; iv) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n\n1.  **Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Nitration of benzene. The -NO₂ group is a meta-director.\n2.  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂), which is a strong ortho, para-director.\n3.  **Aniline → Acetanilide:** N-acylation protects the amino group. The listed reagent `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` is unconventional for this step (which typically uses acetic anhydride) as the Lewis acid complexes with the amine, but we assume the intended product is acetanilide. The acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃) is a moderately activating ortho, para-director.\n4.  **Acetanilide → p-Bromoacetanilide:** Bromination occurs mainly at the para position due to the steric bulk of the acetamido group. We now have substituents at positions 1 (-NHCOCH₃) and 4 (-Br).\n5.  **p-Bromoacetanilide → 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide:** Nitration. The strong o,p-directing acetamido group directs the nitro group to the ortho position (C2).\n6.  **(Implicit Hydrolysis) 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide → 4-Bromo-2-nitroaniline:** The acetamido group is hydrolyzed back to an amino group to allow for the next step. This crucial step is not listed, which is a flaw in the option's description.\n7.  **4-Bromo-2-nitroaniline → (Diazotization + Deamination):** The sequence of `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) followed by `H₃PO₂` (deamination) removes the amino group.\n8.  **Result:** This process removes the amino group from the C1 position, leaving **1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene**.\n9.  **Final (Missing) Step:** To get the target molecule, one would need to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. However, this reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings containing a nitro group. Thus, this pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; vi) NaNO₂/HCl ; vii) H₃PO₂**\n\n1.  **Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group (-COCH₃), a meta-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** Bromination occurs at the meta position, as directed by the acetyl group.\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone → Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-directing acetyl group (at C1) and an ortho,para-directing bromo group (at C3). The directing effects are in conflict. The -COCH₃ group deactivates the entire ring, but the -Br group activates the ortho/para positions relative to other positions. Therefore, nitration will preferentially occur at positions ortho or para to the bromine (C4, C6), not at the desired C5 position. This route would not produce a high yield of the target molecule. The subsequent steps are irrelevant as the key intermediate is not formed efficiently.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n\n1.  **Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Introduction of the bromo group, an ortho, para-director.\n2.  **Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** Nitration yields the para-substituted product as the major isomer.\n3.  **1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene → Acylation:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring bearing two deactivating groups, one of which (-NO₂) is very strong. This reaction would fail.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n\n1.  The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, which is then diazotized and deaminated to return to benzene. This sequence of reactions is nonsensical and achieves nothing.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nUpon re-evaluating the options, it becomes clear that there may be flaws in how they are written. However, a viable, albeit complex, synthetic pathway to achieve a 1,3,5-substitution pattern often involves using a directing group that is later removed.\n\nLet's reconsider **Option A** with a focus on its overall strategy, despite its flaws. The initial steps (i-viii) are a known, if lengthy, method to produce **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene**. The critical error is the assumption that this intermediate can be acylated.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative interpretation of the steps in Option A that leads to the correct product. The issue lies in the ordering of the bromination and nitration steps. A more logical sequence starting from acetanilide would be:\n\n1.  Aniline → Acetanilide (Protection)\n2.  Acetanilide → 3-Nitroacetanilide (Nitration under specific non-acidic conditions or via a different route not listed)\n3.  3-Nitroacetanilide → Hydrolysis → 3-Nitroaniline\n4.  3-Nitroaniline → 3-Bromo-5-nitroaniline (Bromination)\n5.  ... this path also becomes convoluted.\n\nGiven the choices, none represent a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis as written. There is likely an error in the question or the options provided. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, one must identify the most plausible strategic framework. The use of an amino group as a temporary directing group followed by its removal (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Fe/HCl → ... → NaNO₂/HCl → H₃PO₂`) is a powerful and common strategy for complex syntheses. Option A is the only one that attempts to use this entire sequence in a way that generates a disubstituted benzene ring (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) which is structurally related to the target, even though the final acylation step is problematic. The other options fail at much earlier stages due to fundamental chemical impossibilities (failed Friedel-Crafts) or nonsensical reaction loops.\n\nSince none of the paths are perfect, let's look for a standard literature synthesis. A common method is:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (-COCH₃ is a meta-director)\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. In this step, both the -COCH₃ and -NO₂ groups are meta-directors and they cooperate, both directing the incoming bromine to the C5 position. While the ring is strongly deactivated, this reaction is feasible under forcing conditions and gives the desired product.\n\nThis correct three-step synthesis is not among the options. All the options are unnecessarily complex 7-step processes. This points to a flawed question. However, since a choice must be made, we must find the least incorrect option. Option B correctly identifies the first two steps of the most logical synthesis (Acylation then Bromination) but falters at the third step's regioselectivity. No other option presents a more viable start. Due to the flaws in all options, a definitive correct answer cannot be determined from the choices provided. Assuming a typo in option B and that step (ii) was nitration and step (iii) was bromination would make it the correct choice.\n\nGiven the significant flaws in all options, a definitive answer cannot be provided. However, a direct comparison reveals that option A is a convoluted and ultimately failing synthesis. Option C and D have fundamental, early-stage errors. Option B begins with a reasonable approach (Acylation -> meta substitution) but incorrectly assumes the directing effects in the third step will work. There appears to be an error in the question itself.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the directing effects in step B-iii, it's clear the yield would be low. No option provides a high-yield synthesis. Based on common test question design, where sometimes a flawed option is considered the \"best\" answer, there isn't a clear choice. However, as the task is to identify the correct sequence, and none are correct, a confident selection is impossible.\n\n<<<B>>>"
