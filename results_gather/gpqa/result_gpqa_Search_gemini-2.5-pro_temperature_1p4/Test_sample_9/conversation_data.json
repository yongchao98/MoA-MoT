    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze the relationship between mass, radius, and composition.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline. Earth has an average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** This planet's density is given as being very close to Earth's density.\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** With the same composition but less mass, this planet would experience weaker gravitational self-compression. As a result, its density would be lower than Earth's.\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A fundamental principle in planetary science is that as a rocky planet's mass increases, its gravitational force becomes stronger. This intense gravity compresses the planet's material, forcing it into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy. This effect, known as gravitational compression, leads to a higher overall density. Studies on the mass-radius relationship of rocky exoplanets confirm that their densities tend to increase with mass due to this compression. Therefore, a planet with five times Earth's mass but the same composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\nComparing the options, the planet in scenario (c) is subjected to the most intense gravitational compression, which results in the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
