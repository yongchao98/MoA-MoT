    "The problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession in quantum mechanics. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction (S_z). When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the Y direction, the spin begins to precess around this new axis. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and **S** is the spin operator. The particle is aligned with a magnetic field **B** = B**ẑ**, meaning its spin is in the spin-up state along the z-axis. In the S_z basis, this state |ψ(0)> is represented as:\n    |ψ(0)> = |+z> = (1, 0)\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** At time t=0, the magnetic field is switched to **B** = B**ŷ**. The new Hamiltonian governing the system is:\n    H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γ(**S** ⋅ **B**) = -γB S_y\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at a later time t, |ψ(t)>, is given by:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian, we get:\n    |ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) |ψ(0)> = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ_z>(t), which is γ<S_z>(t).\n    <S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>\n    Substituting the expression for |ψ(t)>:\n    <S_z>(t) = <ψ(0)| e^(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |ψ(0)>\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The calculation shows that the expectation value of the spin's z-component oscillates over time:\n    <S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is therefore:\n    <μ_z>(t) = γ <S_z>(t) = (γħ/2) * cos(γBt)\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The equation for <μ_z>(t) is a cosine function. The term inside the cosine, ωt, gives the angular frequency of oscillation. In this case, the argument is (γB)t.\n\nTherefore, the angular oscillation frequency is ω = γB. This is a well-known result called the Larmor frequency. The phenomenon itself, the rotation of the spin's expectation value around the magnetic field direction, is called Larmor precession.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
