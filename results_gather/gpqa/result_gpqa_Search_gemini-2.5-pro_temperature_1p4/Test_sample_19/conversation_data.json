    "The impulse approximation is a foundational concept in many-body nuclear physics that simplifies calculations by treating interactions with a nucleus as a series of interactions with its individual nucleons. This approximation rests on three principal assumptions.\n\nThe key assumptions are:\n1.  **Interaction with a single nucleon:** The incoming particle or probe interacts with only one nucleon at a time. The total interaction is treated as the sum of these individual encounters. This is also referred to as the single-nucleon current assumption.\n2.  **Nuclear transparency:** The projectile interacts with a chosen nucleon as if that nucleon were isolated. This implies that the projectile is not affected by the other \"spectator\" nucleons before or after the primary interaction.\n3.  **Negligible binding forces:** During the brief and decisive moment of the interaction, the binding forces holding the selected nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible. The interaction is assumed to happen so quickly that the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle.\n\nThe fourth statement provided, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While models of nucleon structure are crucial for understanding the nature of the interaction forces, they are conceptually separate from the impulse approximation, which primarily concerns the dynamics of a nucleon within the nuclear medium during a collision.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are that the interaction involves only individual nucleons, the rest of the nucleus is transparent to the probe, and the binding forces on the struck nucleon are ignored during the collision.\n\n<<<D>>>"
