    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final concentration (M₂):** Using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration is:\n    (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. Moles of Acetic Acid\n\nNext, we determine the number of moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution that will be titrated.\n\n*   **Moles of acetic acid:** Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = **0.001 mol**\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, sodium acetate. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH added:** 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of acetic acid remaining (HA):** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   **Moles of acetate formed (A⁻):** 0.00025 mol\n\nThe pH of this buffer solution is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **pKa:** -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **pH:** pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   **pH:** 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ **4.26**\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only sodium acetate, the conjugate base of acetic acid. This base reacts with water (hydrolysis), making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence:** 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume of the solution:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of sodium acetate ([A⁻]):** 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\nNow, we calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n\n*   **Kb for acetate:** Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Concentration of OH⁻ ([OH⁻]):** √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH:** -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   **pH:** 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ **8.52**\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
