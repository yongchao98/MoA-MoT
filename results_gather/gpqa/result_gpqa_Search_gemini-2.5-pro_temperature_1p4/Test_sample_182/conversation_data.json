    "Here is a step-by-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. Let's assume it's at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this structure is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is an extremely powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its primary function is to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, this reagent will cause the following reductions:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkene (C=C)** bonds (both in the ring and the vinyl group) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, every double bond and all oxygen atoms are removed, and the molecule is fully saturated with hydrogen.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and Formula\n\nThe reaction reduces all functional groups and double bonds, but it does not break the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton remains intact.\n\n*   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl group` at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl group` at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe original molecule had 10 carbon atoms, and since no carbons are lost, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The product is a fully saturated, substituted cycloalkane. A saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a cycloalkane) has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nGiven that our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor our product with the formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane backbone. All other forms of unsaturation (double bonds from the original alkene, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid groups) have been eliminated.\n\n<<<C>>>"
