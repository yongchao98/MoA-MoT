    "An N-sided polygon where N approaches infinity is a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. This problem, therefore, simplifies to finding the far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This phenomenon is known as Fraunhofer diffraction, and the resulting pattern is called an Airy pattern.\n\nThe Airy pattern consists of a bright central region known as the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the intensity pattern.\n\nThe angular position (θ) of these minima is determined by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (m * λ) / d\n\nWhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n*   d is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe diameter of the aperture 'd' is twice the radius 'a', so d = 2a.\n\nThe angular positions for the minima are found using the specific values for 'm' which correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function.\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):** The first minimum occurs where m ≈ 1.220. This value is derived from the first zero of the J₁(x) Bessel function (which is approximately 3.8317) divided by π.\n    θ₁ ≈ (1.220 * λ) / d = (1.220 * λ) / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):** The second minimum corresponds to the second zero of the J₁(x) Bessel function, which is approximately 7.0156. The coefficient 'm' for the second minimum is therefore 7.0156 / π ≈ 2.233.\n    θ₂ ≈ (2.233 * λ) / d = (2.233 * λ) / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first and second minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ ≈ (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ ≈ 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.5065 λ / a is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
