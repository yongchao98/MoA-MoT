    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent, R₂CuLi) is a well-established method for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **Epoxide:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexene oxide. The epoxide bridge connects carbons C1 and C6. C1 has a methyl substituent, while C6 has a hydrogen.\n    *   **Organocuprate:** Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi). This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl group (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are sterically sensitive nucleophiles. The provided information and general principles of organic chemistry state that the nucleophile will attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   In the given epoxide, C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon, and the methyl nucleophile from the Gilman reagent will attack at this position.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via a backside attack, which is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction. This has two important stereochemical consequences:\n    *   **Inversion of Configuration:** The stereocenter at the site of attack undergoes an inversion of its configuration. The starting material has an (S) configuration at C6. The backside attack will invert this center to an (R) configuration in the product.\n    *   **Retention of Configuration:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps retain their original configuration. Thus, the configurations at C1 (1R), C3 (3R), and C4 (4R) will remain unchanged.\n\n**Determining the Product Structure and Name:**\n\n1.  **Substitution Pattern:** The nucleophilic attack of a methyl group at C6 of the bicycloheptane ring opens the epoxide. The C6-O bond breaks, and after an aqueous workup, the oxygen attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This results in a cyclohexanol derivative with the following substituents based on the original ring numbering:\n    *   An -OH group and a methyl group on C1.\n    *   A new methyl group on C6.\n    *   A methyl group on C3.\n    *   A methyl group on C4.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** To name the final product, the ring is renumbered according to IUPAC rules for cyclohexanols.\n    *   The carbon bearing the -OH group receives the highest priority and is designated C1 of the product. This corresponds to C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible locants. Numbering from C1 (original) towards C6 (original) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. This numbering scheme {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than the alternative {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   Therefore, the product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n3.  **Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** Configuration is retained from the reactant (1R). So, the product is (1R).\n    *   **C2:** This is the original C6. The configuration is inverted from (6S) to (R). So, the product is (2R).\n    *   **C4:** This is the original C4. The configuration is retained (4R). So, the product is (4R).\n    *   **C5:** This is the original C3. The configuration is retained (3R). So, the product is (5R).\n\nCombining the name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
