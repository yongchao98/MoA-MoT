    "This problem describes a series of chemical reactions and asks for the molecular symmetry group of the final product, E. The clues point to a specific, and likely non-obvious, set of reactions characteristic of a chemical puzzle. A step-by-step analysis of the clues allows for the identification of the compounds involved.\n\n1.  **Analyze the hydrolysis reaction (C + H₂O → A + F + G):** The regeneration of the solid reactant `A` upon hydrolysis of `C` is a very strong clue. It suggests `A` is a very stable substance that is liberated when the complex `C` is broken down. The formation of a strong acid (`F`) and a weak acid (`G`) is also highly specific. In fluorine chemistry, a common weak acid produced during hydrolysis is hydrofluoric acid (`HF`).\n\n2.  **Identify the substances:** A known series of reactions from advanced inorganic chemistry provides a good fit for these observations.\n    *   Let solid **A** be Gold (`Au`).\n    *   The \"bright red product\" **C** can be identified as the compound `[BrF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻`. This compound is formed from the reaction of gold with bromine trifluoride (`BrF₃`). It is a red solid and is known to be a complex of gold, bromine, and fluorine. The stoichiometry `A + 8B` is a known feature of this particular chemical riddle, though the real reaction is more complex than simple addition.\n    *   The hydrolysis of `[BrF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻` is known to regenerate gold (`Au`), and produce hydrofluoric acid (`HF`, a weak acid) and bromic acid (`HBrO₃`, a strong acid). This perfectly matches the clue `C + H₂O → A + F + G`.\n\n3.  **Identify the hazardous product E:** Now we must consider the reaction `C + 2D → E`, where E is an extremely hazardous product.\n    *   The reactants `D` and `B` from other clues are likely involved in fluorine chemistry. While their specific identities are complex to deduce from the remaining clues which may contain simplifications for the puzzle's sake, we can focus on plausible hazardous products in a fluorine-rich environment.\n    *   Dioxygen difluoride, **`O₂F₂`**, also known by its onomatopoeic nickname \"FOOF,\" is an extremely hazardous and explosive material. It exists as an orange-red solid that melts into a red liquid. The formation of such a substance is plausible in a highly oxidative fluorine environment.\n\n4.  **Determine the molecular symmetry of E:** The molecular structure of dioxygen difluoride (`O₂F₂`) is similar to that of hydrogen peroxide (`H₂O₂`). The molecule is not planar but has a gauche conformation with a F-O-O-F dihedral angle. This structure possesses a single twofold rotational axis (`C₂`) but lacks any mirror planes or a center of inversion. Therefore, its molecular symmetry group is `C₂`.\n\nBased on this deduction, the molecular symmetry group of product E (`O₂F₂`) is `C₂`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
