    "A textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV will absorb red light.\n\nWhen a substance like a textile dye absorbs light, it becomes excited. It then releases energy in the form of emitted light, but at a lower energy level and longer wavelength. The color of the absorbed light is complementary to the color of the emitted light.\n\nFirst, the wavelength of the emitted light is calculated from its energy using the equation E = hc/λ, where 'E' is energy, 'h' is Planck's constant, 'c' is the speed of light, and 'λ' is the wavelength. An energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nanometers.\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green portion of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\nThe color of light absorbed by a substance is the complementary color of the light it emits or reflects. According to the color wheel, the complementary color of green is red. Thus, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
