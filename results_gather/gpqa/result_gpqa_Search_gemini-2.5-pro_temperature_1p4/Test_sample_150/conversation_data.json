    "To calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable *P* will yield the value 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. According to the Born rule, this probability is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Define the State Vector and the Operator**\n\n*   The state of the system at time *t*, denoted as `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n    ```\n    |-1|\n    | 2|\n    | 1|\n    ```\n*   The observable of the system, represented by the matrix operator *P*, is:\n    ```\n    | 0      1/√2    0    |\n    | 1/√2   0       1/√2 |\n    | 0      1/√2    0    |\n    ```\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P**\n\nThe possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. We find these by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n\n```\n| -λ     1/√2    0    |\n| 1/√2   -λ      1/√2 |\n| 0      1/√2    -λ    |\n```\n\nThe determinant is:\n-λ( (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) - (1/√2)( (-λ)(1/√2) - 0 ) = 0\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(1 - λ²) = 0\nλ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1. Since 0 is one of the eigenvalues, it is a possible measurement outcome.\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nNext, we find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0 by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n\n```\n| 0      1/√2    0    | |x|   |0|\n| 1/√2   0       1/√2 | |y| = |0|\n| 0      1/√2    0    | |z|   |0|\n```\n\nThis yields the system of equations:\n*   (1/√2)y = 0  =>  y = 0\n*   (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is of the form `(x, 0, -x)`. We can choose x=1 to get `(1, 0, -1)`.\n\nTo normalize this eigenvector, we divide by its magnitude:\nMagnitude = √(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩` is:\n```\n| 1/√2 |\n|  0   |\n|-1/√2 |\n```\n\n**4. Normalize the State Vector**\n\nThe given state vector `|ψ⟩` must also be normalized.\nMagnitude = √((-1)² + 2² + 1²) = √(1 + 4 + 1) = √6\nThe normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n```\n|-1/√6 |\n| 2/√6 |\n| 1/√6 |\n```\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 is the squared magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector and the eigenvector for 0, denoted as `|⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n\nFirst, we calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀|` is the conjugate transpose of `|v₀⟩`, which is `(1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`.\n\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩` = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + (0)(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6)\n= -1/√12 - 1/√12\n= -2/√12\n= -2 / (2√3)\n= -1/√3\n\nFinally, we square the absolute value of this result to find the probability:\nProbability = | -1/√3 |² = 1/3.\n\nThus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
