    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Identify all possible states of the system.**\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates for the system. These are:\n*   (S1, S2, S3)\n1.  (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**2. Calculate the energy (E) for each state.**\nThe energy is given by the formula E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. We can group the states by their energy levels.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1).**\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   For the state (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    There are **2** states with an energy level of **-3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   Let's take the state (+1, +1, -1) as an example:\n        E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   All states with one spin flipped will have one product of terms equal to +1 and two products equal to -1. The sum will always be -1.\n        *   (+1, +1, -1) -> E = J\n        *   (+1, -1, +1) -> E = J\n        *   (-1, +1, +1) -> E = J\n        *   (+1, -1, -1) -> E = J\n        *   (-1, +1, -1) -> E = J\n        *   (-1, -1, +1) -> E = J\n    There are **6** states with an energy level of **J**.\n\n**3. Write the formula for the partition function (Z).**\nThe partition function is the sum over all states (i) of the Boltzmann factor, Z = Σᵢ e^(-βEᵢ). Since we have states with the same energy (degeneracy), we can write the sum over energy levels (j):\nZ = Σⱼ gⱼ e^(-βEⱼ)\nwhere gⱼ is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level Eⱼ.\n\n**4. Calculate the partition function Z.**\nUsing the energy levels and their degeneracies we found:\n*   Energy E₁ = -3J has degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n*   Energy E₂ = J has degeneracy g₂ = 6.\n\nSubstitute these values into the partition function formula:\nZ = (g₁ * e^(-βE₁)) + (g₂ * e^(-βE₂))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
