    "To solve this problem, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State\n*   A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) are involved in the annihilation.\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the proton is also at rest.\n*   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass of a proton is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV. So, $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2$.\n\n### 2. Final State\n*   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   These four particles have the same mass, $m_A$, given that $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must be zero (since the initial momentum was zero). By symmetry, the available energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles.\n*   This means each particle A will have the same total energy, $E_A$, and the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles: $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Energy\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n\n$E_i = E_f$\n\n$2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n$2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n### 4. Calculation\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4 \\times m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 \\times m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the given and known values:\n*   $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n\nNow, we solve for the velocity, $v$, using the definition of the Lorentz factor. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912}$\n\n$\\beta \\approx 0.769$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
