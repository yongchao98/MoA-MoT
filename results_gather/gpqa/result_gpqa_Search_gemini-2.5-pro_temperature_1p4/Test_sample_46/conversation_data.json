    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `C + 1 + N/2 - H/2`.\n    For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 + 1/2 - 11/2 = 5`.\n    A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is typical for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the context of the molecular formula, this is consistent with an ester functional group.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the nearby protons, shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the nearby protons, shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H) and 1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This quartet and triplet combination is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is significantly downfield, which is indicative of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (`-O-CH2CH3`).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange.\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Structures\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. Correct.\n    *   **Structure:** Has a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **IR Match:** The primary amine accounts for the bands at 3420/3325 cm-1, and the ester carbonyl matches the 1720 cm-1 band. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **1H NMR Match:** The 1,4-disubstitution matches the two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region. The electron-donating -NH2 group would cause the adjacent protons to appear upfield (~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group would shift its adjacent protons downfield (~8.0 ppm). The ethyl ester structure perfectly explains the quartet at 4.5 ppm and the triplet at 1.20 ppm. The broad -NH2 signal at 4.0 ppm is also consistent. This structure aligns perfectly with all data. A spectral database confirms these assignments.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. Correct.\n    *   **Structure:** Has a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), and a primary amide (-CONH2).\n    *   **Mismatch:** The 1H NMR would show a complex splitting pattern for the aromatic protons, not two clean doublets. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. Correct.\n    *   **Structure:** Contains a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine.\n    *   **Mismatch:** A secondary amide would show only *one* N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not the two observed. This contradicts the IR data.\n\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. Correct.\n    *   **Structure:** This is an isomer of A. It has the primary amine and a 1,4-disubstituted ring. However, the ester is formed from propanoic acid and 4-aminophenol (`-O-CO-CH2CH3`).\n    *   **Mismatch:** In this structure, the ethyl group's -CH2- is adjacent to the carbonyl group, not the ester oxygen. Its 1H NMR signal (a quartet) would be expected around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm. This contradicts the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the IR and 1H NMR spectra, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only compound that fits all the provided data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
