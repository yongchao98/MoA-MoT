    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n### 1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₙHₘ.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\n`mass % H = (m * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + m * 1.008)`\nApproximating with integer masses (H=1, C=12):\n`0.1428 ≈ m / (12n + m)`\nThis value, 0.1428, is very close to 1/7.\n`1/7 = m / (12n + m)  => 12n + m = 7m  => 12n = 6m  => m = 2n`\nSo, the hydrocarbon Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane.\n\nFurthermore, Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Other small cycloalkanes like cyclopropane and cyclobutane are gases at room temperature and not typically used as liquid solvents. Therefore, it is highly probable that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n### 2. Characterize Mixture Y\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the absence of typical carbon-carbon double bonds. One of these liquids is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This means the second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also be converted into cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The most plausible candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure and/or temperature).\n\nSo, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Reaction X → Y\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B), is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n\nSince mixture Y is formed in an equimolar ratio, the reaction can be written as:\n`A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n\nBy the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal that in the products.\n-   Carbon atoms: The products are C₆H₁₂ and C₆H₆. Since hydrogenation of both A and B leads to cyclohexane (a C₆ compound), A and B must also be C₆ hydrocarbons. Let A = C₆Hₓ and B = C₆Hᵧ. The carbon atoms are balanced (6 + 6 = 6 + 6).\n-   Hydrogen atoms: `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n\n### 4. Verify the Properties of Mixture X\nThe components of mixture X, A (C₆Hₓ) and B (C₆Hᵧ), must satisfy the following conditions:\n*   They decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). This implies x < 12 and y < 12.\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B yields only cyclohexane. This confirms they have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\nLet's find plausible structures for A and B based on `x + y = 18`. A combination that fits is `x=10` and `y=8`.\n*   **A = C₆H₁₀**: This corresponds to **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water and has no conjugated bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **B = C₆H₈**: This corresponds to a cyclohexadiene. There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (isolated double bonds). Since the problem excludes conjugated bonds, B must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. It decolorizes bromine water and its hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane.\n\nThe disproportionation reaction would be a hydrogen transfer from 1,4-cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene:\n`C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)`\nIn this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses 2 hydrogen atoms to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogen atoms to become cyclohexane. This process, known as catalytic transfer hydrogenation, fits the description perfectly.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe two liquids in the equimolar mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is **18**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
