    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The initial assumption is that the density of stars, denoted by ρ (rho), is constant everywhere in space. This means the number of stars in any given volume is simply ρ multiplied by that volume.\n\n2.  **Volume and Distance**: Consider a sphere around the Earth with a radius *d*. The volume of this sphere is V = (4/3)πd³. The total number of stars (N) within this distance *d* is N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Shell**: To find how the number of stars changes with distance, we consider a thin spherical shell at distance *d* with a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (*dd*). So, *dV* = 4πd² *dd*. The number of stars (*dN*) in this thin shell is dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² *dd*.\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (*d*). The relationship is `d = 1/plx`.\n\n5.  **Changing Variables**: Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the derivative dN/d(plx). To do this, we use the chain rule: dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx)).\n    *   We already found `dN/dd = 4πρd²`.\n    *   Now we need to find `dd/d(plx)`. By differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`, we get `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Relationship**: Now we substitute these parts back into the chain rule equation:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (4πρd²) * (-1/plx²)`.\n    *   Next, substitute `d = 1/plx` into this equation: `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ * (1/plx)²) * (-1/plx²)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/plx²) * (-1/plx²) = -4πρ/plx⁴`.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that as parallax increases (looking at closer stars), the cumulative star count decreases. When considering the number of stars within a specific parallax interval, we are interested in the magnitude or density. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis relationship is also a foundational concept in understanding certain observational biases, such as the Lutz-Kelker bias, which accounts for the fact that for a given parallax measurement, it's more likely to be observing a more distant star than a closer one due to the larger volume of space at greater distances. An academic paper explicitly states, \"We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Then the number per unit parallax interval is dn = 4Πρ/π⁴ dπ,\" where π is parallax and ρ is the star density, confirming the derived relationship.\n\n<<<A>>>"
