    "To find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (M_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (M_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (ν) is considered to be zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles, the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν), must move in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta. Let's call this momentum 'p'.\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\n*   E_initial = M_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n*   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n\nThe total energy for a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ = √((pc)² + (M_μc²)²)\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): E_ν = pc\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n139.6 MeV = √((pc)² + (105.7 MeV)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for pc (the momentum of each particle in units of MeV/c), we can rearrange and square the equation:\n139.6 - pc = √((pc)² + 105.7²)\n(139.6 - pc)² = (pc)² + 105.7²\n19488.16 - 279.2(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + 11172.49\n\nNow, we solve for pc:\n19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2(pc)\n8315.67 = 279.2(pc)\npc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**3. Calculating Kinetic Energies (KE):**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy (KE = E - mc²).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    We can find the muon's total energy from the conservation of energy:\n    E_μ = E_initial - E_ν\n    E_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is:\n    KE_μ = E_μ - M_μc²\n    KE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches one of the given options.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is 29.8 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
