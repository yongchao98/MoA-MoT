    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Amplitude of Variation from the Spotted Star\n\nFirst, we determine the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating, spotted star. This variation is due to the difference in flux between the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere.\n\nThe flux (F) from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. We will compare the flux when the unspotted hemisphere faces us (maximum brightness, F_max) to the flux when the spotted hemisphere faces us (minimum brightness, F_min).\n\n*   **Star's effective temperature (T_eff):** 6000 K\n*   **Spots' temperature (T_spot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Filling factor of spots on the hemisphere (f):** 20% or 0.20. This means when the spotted hemisphere faces us, 20% of the visible disk is covered by spots.\n\nThe maximum flux (from the unspotted hemisphere) is proportional to:\n**F_max ∝ T_eff⁴**\n\nThe minimum flux (from the spotted hemisphere) is a combination of the flux from the normal photosphere (covering 1 - f = 0.8 of the disk) and the flux from the cooler spots (covering f = 0.2 of the disk):\n**F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴**\n\nThe relative amplitude of the signal is the drop in flux divided by the maximum flux:\n**Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\n**Amplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴**\n**Amplitude = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴**\n**Amplitude = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴**\n**Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]**\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n**Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]**\n**Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]**\n**Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * [1 - 0.4823]**\n**Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177**\n**Amplitude ≈ 0.1035**\n\nSo, the rotational modulation of the spotted star causes a brightness variation with an amplitude of about 10.35%.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius\n\nNext, we need to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal amplitude. When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this transit is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   **Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)**\n*   **Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)**\n*   **Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\nThe problem states that this transit depth must be equal to the amplitude of the signal from the spotted star.\n\n**(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude**\n**(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035**\n\nTo find the relative radius (R_pl / R_star), we take the square root of the amplitude:\n**R_pl / R_star = √0.1035**\n**R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217**\n\n### Step 3: Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.32 matches one of the given choices.\n\n*   A) ~0.39\n*   B) ~0.11\n*   C) ~0.32\n*   D) ~0.07\n\nThe correct answer is therefore approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>"
