    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe the decay of the particle $X^0$, we first need to calculate the average distance it travels in the bubble chamber before decaying. This distance is known as the mean decay length.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor accounts for the effects of time dilation on a particle moving at relativistic speeds. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest energy (mass, m).\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Mass of $X^0$ (m) = 3.41 GeV/c²\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before it decays in the laboratory's frame of reference. It is calculated by multiplying the particle's speed (which is very close to the speed of light, c), its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) = 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Lorentz factor (γ) ≈ 7.918\n\nThe formula for the mean decay length is:\nL = c * γ * $\\tau_0$\nL = (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * 7.918 * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\nL ≈ 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Interpretation of \"Observing at Least 30% of Decays\"\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. In the context of particle detectors, to \"observe\" a decay, the detector's resolution must be able to distinguish the decay track. This implies the resolution length must be smaller than the distance the particle travels.\n\nThere are different interpretations for this condition:\n*   **Interpretation A: Resolution equal to the Mean Decay Length.** Often, the mean decay length itself is considered the characteristic distance that needs to be resolved. Our calculated mean decay length (1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m) is of the same order of magnitude as option A.\n\n*   **Interpretation B: The distance at which 30% of particles have decayed.** Particle decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles that have decayed by a distance `x` is given by P(decay < x) = 1 - e^(-x/L). Setting this to 0.3 gives:\n    0.3 = 1 - e^(-x / 1.90e-6)\n    e^(-x / 1.90e-6) = 0.7\n    x = - (1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m) * ln(0.7) ≈ 0.68 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n*   **Interpretation C: The minimum distance traveled by the 30% of particles that travel the farthest.** This means we are looking for the resolution `x` such that the probability of a particle traveling farther than `x` is 30%.\n    P(decay > x) = e^(-x/L) = 0.3\n    e^(-x / 1.90e-6) = 0.3\n    x = - (1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m) * ln(0.3) ≈ 2.29 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nComparing our calculations to the given options:\n*   Mean Decay Length (L) ≈ 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m\n*   Distance for 30% to decay ≈ 0.68 x 10⁻⁶ m\n*   Minimum distance for 30% to survive ≈ 2.29 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nBoth the mean decay length (1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m) and the distance from Interpretation C (2.29 x 10⁻⁶ m) are very close to option A (2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m). The slight difference of about 9% could arise from using more precise values for the speed of light or from minor variations in the input parameters. Given the choices, the calculated decay length provides the most reasonable match. Therefore, the required resolution is on the order of the mean decay length.\n\nFinal calculated value matches most closely with option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
