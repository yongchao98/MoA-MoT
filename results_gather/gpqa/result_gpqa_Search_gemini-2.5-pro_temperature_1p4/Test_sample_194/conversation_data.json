    "The problem can be solved by determining the orbital parameters of the system. The key steps involve using the information from the first planet to find the system's orbital inclination, and then using that inclination to find the maximum possible orbit for the second planet that still allows it to transit the star.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometry\n\n*   A planet transits its star when its orbit is viewed nearly edge-on. The orbital inclination, `i`, is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky. For a transit to occur, `i` must be close to 90 degrees.\n*   The impact parameter, `b`, describes how centrally the planet crosses the star. It's the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. A `b` of 0 means a central transit, while a `b` of 1 means the planet's center passes just over the star's edge.\n*   The relationship between impact parameter `b`, the orbit's semi-major axis `a`, the stellar radius `R_s`, and the orbital inclination `i` is given by the formula:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\n### 2. Using Planet 1 to Find the System's Inclination\n\nWe are given the following for the first planet:\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 3 days\n*   Impact Parameter (b₁): 0.2\n\nSince both planets share the same orbital plane, the inclination `i` is the same for both. We can express the relationship for the first planet as:\n`a₁ * cos(i) = b₁ * R_s = 0.2 * R_s`\n\nHere, `a₁` is the semi-major axis of the first planet.\n\n### 3. Determining the Condition for Planet 2 to Transit\n\nFor the second planet to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter `b₂` must be less than or equal to 1 (assuming a transit requires the planet's center to cross the stellar disk). To find the *maximum* possible orbital period, we need to find the *maximum* possible semi-major axis (`a₂_max`), which occurs at the edge of the transit condition. This corresponds to a grazing transit where `b₂ = 1`.\n\nSo, for the second planet at its orbital limit:\n`a₂_max * cos(i) = b₂_max * R_s = 1 * R_s`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Orbits\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `a₁ * cos(i) = 0.2 * R_s`\n2.  `a₂_max * cos(i) = 1 * R_s`\n\nBy dividing the second equation by the first, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n`(a₂_max * cos(i)) / (a₁ * cos(i)) = (1 * R_s) / (0.2 * R_s)`\n`a₂_max / a₁ = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\nThis means the semi-major axis of the second planet can be at most 5 times that of the first planet.\n\n### 5. Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). We can use this to find the maximum period for the second planet (`P₂_max`):\n`(P₂_max / P₁)² = (a₂_max / a₁ )³`\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n`(P₂_max / 3)² = (5)³ = 125`\n`P₂_max² = 125 * (3)² = 125 * 9 = 1125`\n`P₂_max = √1125 ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe calculation shows that the maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star were not necessary for this calculation, as the simplified transit condition (`b ≤ 1`) is sufficient.\n\n<<<A>>>"
