    "To determine the correct option, we need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and then assess the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension Analysis\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over four-dimensional spacetime:\n`S = ∫d⁴x L`\n\nThe mass dimension of the spacetime volume element `d⁴x` is `[d⁴x] = M⁻⁴`. For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L] = M⁴`.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n`L_int = κ * ψ̄ * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`\n\nNow, let's determine the mass dimension of each component:\n\n*   **Fermion fields (ψ and ψ̄):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is `ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of `M⁴`, the fermion fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` must each have a mass dimension of `M^(3/2)`. Thus, `[ψ] = [ψ̄] = M^(3/2)`.\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ_μν):** This is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless, so `[σ_μν] = M⁰`.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `-(1/4)F_μν F^μν`. For this term to have a mass dimension of `M⁴`, `F^μν` must have a mass dimension of `M²`. So, `[F^μν] = M²`.\n\nNow we can set up the equation for the mass dimensions of the interaction Lagrangian:\n`[L_int] = [κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ_μν] * [ψ] * [F^μν]`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2) * M⁰ * M^(3/2) * M²`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M³ * M²`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M⁵`\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of κ:\n`[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹`\n\n### 2. Renormalizability\n\nA key criterion for determining if a quantum field theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (it's dimensionless), the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction term is not renormalizable. Interactions with coupling constants that have a negative mass dimension lead to divergences that become worse at higher orders of perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to cancel, which strips the theory of its predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
