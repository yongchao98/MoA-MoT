    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This can be done using the provided overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, such as [Co(SCN)₂] (denoted as α₂), is calculated by the following formula, where the total cobalt concentration cancels out:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of each term in the denominator of the equation:\n*   **1:** Represents the free Co²⁺ ions.\n*   **β₁[SCN⁻]¹:** 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   **β₂[SCN⁻]²:** 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   **β₃[SCN⁻]³:** 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   **β₄[SCN⁻]⁴:** 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNext, we sum these values to find the total value of the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator corresponds to the term for the desired species, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
