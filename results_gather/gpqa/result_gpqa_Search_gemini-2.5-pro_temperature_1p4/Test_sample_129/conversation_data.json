    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds that can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) line, which is absorbed by neutral hydrogen, has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Ångströms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, meaning this line cannot be observed from the ground if it is emitted by an object at rest relative to us.\n\nFor the Ly-α absorption to be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope, its wavelength must be stretched by the expansion of the universe (redshifted) into the visible part of the spectrum. The atmospheric cutoff, or the shortest wavelength that can effectively pass through the atmosphere to reach ground-based telescopes, is approximately 3200-3300 Å (320-330 nm). Some observations are possible down to about 300 nm, though efficiency is low. Let's use a conservative value of about 3500 Å for the start of the observable optical window from the ground.\n\nThe redshift (z) is calculated using the formula:\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nWhere:\n*   λ_observed is the wavelength measured at the telescope.\n*   λ_rest is the wavelength emitted by the source at rest (1216 Å).\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set λ_observed to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (~3500 Å):\n\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.878 - 1\nz ≈ 1.878\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 1.9. Some sources mention that for ground-based observations, the typical redshift for Ly-α is z ≳ 1.7 or z ≳ 2.5, which aligns with this calculation.\n\nBased on this calculation, the lowest redshift required for the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line to be shifted into the observable window of ground-based telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
