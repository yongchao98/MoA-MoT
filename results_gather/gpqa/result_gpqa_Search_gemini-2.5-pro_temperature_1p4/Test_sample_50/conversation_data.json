    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the grounded conducting sphere with a fictitious \"image\" charge that reproduces the same electric field outside the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, an image charge `q'` is placed within the sphere along the same line as the original charge.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center is `b = R^2 / d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere's surface. In the image charge method, this force is equivalent to the force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` is half of the interaction potential between the real charge and the image charge. This factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge distribution on the sphere changes as the real charge is brought in from infinity. The formula for the potential energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    where `V_image` is the potential at the location of the real charge `q` due to the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Derivation:**\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential at the position of `q` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   A) `U = -kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   B) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   C) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    *   D) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    The derived expression `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
