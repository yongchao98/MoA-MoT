    "The validity of the Mott-Gurney equation rests on several key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism.\n\nThe core conditions are:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device**: The current is assumed to be carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free**: The model applies to an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no trap states within the bandgap that could immobilize charge carriers. The presence of traps would alter the relationship between current and voltage.\n*   **Ohmic Contact**: One of the contacts must be \"Ohmic,\" meaning it can act as an infinite reservoir of charge carriers, able to inject them into the device without any energy barrier. This ensures the current is limited by the charge buildup within the material (space charge) and not by the injection process itself. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would lead to injection-limited current, a different phenomenon.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current**: The charge transport is assumed to be dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current resulting from the random thermal motion and concentration gradients of carriers (diffusion current) is considered negligible.\n\nReviewing the given options based on these established conditions:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly includes all the key assumptions. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is equivalent to having an Ohmic contact.\n*   **B) ... for a two-carrier device...** This is incorrect; the model is for single-carrier transport.\n*   **C) ... with negligible drift current.** This is incorrect; the SCLC regime is dominated by drift current.\n*   **D) ... with a Schottky contact...** This is incorrect; an Ohmic contact is required, not a rectifying Schottky contact.\n\nTherefore, statement A accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
