    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided clues, the following deductions can be made to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n*   **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. Regular water, by contrast, melts at 273.15 K.\n\n*   **Identification of Precipitate G and the Reaction:** Since heating precipitate G releases B (D₂O), G is likely a deuterated hydrate. The violent reaction of Substance X with liquid Y produces a precipitate G and a gas W. A known violent reaction is that of a strong reducing agent with water. This suggests that Substance X is a deuterated reducing agent.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X:** The clue that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains two oxygen atoms is crucial. Strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. Milder reducing agents would only reduce the ketone, leaving a hydroxy acid with three oxygen atoms. Given that Substance X contains a heavier isotope, it is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, a common and powerful reagent in organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Identification of Gas W and Liquid Y:** A molecule of gas W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. When LiAlD₄ (Substance X) reacts, it releases its deuterium. If it reacts with heavy water (D₂O) as liquid Y, the reaction is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    The gas released (W) is Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the description of gas W. Other simple molecules like Helium also have this property but are unlikely products of this reaction. The precipitate G is Aluminum Hydroxide-d3 (Al(OD)₃), which upon heating would indeed decompose to release heavy water (D₂O).\n\n*   **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers as suggested by the answer choices.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element: There are four atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 x 2 = 8.\n    *   The cumulative atomic mass is 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
