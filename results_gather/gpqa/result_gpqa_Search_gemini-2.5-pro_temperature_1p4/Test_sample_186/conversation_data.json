    "### Summary of ESPRESSO's performance\n\nTo determine which stars are detectable, I need to find the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a one-hour (3600s) exposure with a single 8.2m VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode).\n\nFrom the search results, I found an article that provides a performance plot for ESPRESSO. Specifically, Figure 4 in Pepe et al. (2014b), referenced in this article, shows the expected S/N versus stellar apparent magnitude. The red curve in the left panel of that figure corresponds to a 3600s (1-hour) exposure in singleHR mode. By inspecting this plot (or similar information), I can determine the limiting magnitude. A direct value is also mentioned in a user manual, which states that ESPRESSO can reach a S/N of 10 for a V = 19 magnitude target in a one-hour exposure. This performance is for the 4-UT mode (combining all four telescopes), but the question specifies coupling with \"one of the 8m VLT telescopes\". Another source mentions that in 1-UT mode, ESPRESSO can detect rocky planets around stars as faint as V ≈ 9. This is for achieving a very high radial velocity precision (10 cm/s), which requires a much higher S/N than 10. The article also shows a plot for the singleHR mode (1-UT). Looking at the red curve (3600s), a V magnitude of around 16-17 seems to correspond to a S/N of 10. Let's use the information from the ESO ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) for a more precise value. Unfortunately, I cannot operate the ETC directly. However, the available documents consistently suggest that V=16 is a conservative estimate for detectability with S/N=10 in 1 hour with one UT. Let's proceed with this threshold. A star with V > 16 will be considered not detectable.\n\n### Analysis of the listed stars:\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** Various sources list it as -0.74, -0.72, or -0.62. It is the second brightest star in the night sky.\n*   **Location:** Declination is approximately -52° 41′.\n*   **Observability from Paranal:** The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of about -24.6°. A star at a declination of -52° is well observable from this location.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude of about -0.7, Canopus is extremely bright, far brighter than the V=16 limit. ESPRESSO is designed for much fainter objects, and observing Canopus would likely require significant neutral density filtering to avoid detector saturation, but it is certainly detectable.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** Approximately 1.98, varying between 1.86 and 2.13.\n*   **Location:** Declination is about +89° 15′.\n*   **Observability from Paranal:** Paranal's latitude is -24.6°. The theoretical northern visibility limit is a declination of +90° - 24.6° = +65.4°. Polaris, at almost +90° declination, is far north of this limit and is not observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** Not detectable because it is not observable.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** Calculated using the formula: m = M + 5 * log10(d/10), where M=15 and d=10 pc.\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0 mag.\n*   **Location:** Declination is 0°, which is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the V=16 limit. Therefore, this star is detectable.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** M=15, d=200 pc.\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5 mag.\n*   **Location:** Declination is 0°, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the V=16 limit. Therefore, this star is not detectable under the specified conditions.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** M=15, d=5 pc.\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.5 mag.\n*   **Location:** Declination is 0°, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the V=16 limit. Therefore, this star is detectable.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** M=15, d=50 pc.\n    m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.5 mag.\n*   **Location:** Declination is 0°, observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=16 limit. Therefore, this star is not detectable under the specified conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following stars would be detectable:\n1.  **Canopus** (Apparent V mag ≈ -0.7)\n2.  **Star (c)** (Apparent V mag = 15.0)\n3.  **Star (e)** (Apparent V mag = 13.5)\n\nThe following stars would not be detectable:\n*   **Polaris** (Not observable from Paranal)\n*   **Star (d)** (Apparent V mag = 21.5, too faint)\n*   **Star (f)** (Apparent V mag = 18.5, too faint)\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
