    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state, we must consider the arrangement of four identical spin-1/2 particles within a one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions and therefore must adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nEach energy level 'n' can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin up (+1/2) and one with spin down (-1/2), due to their spin-1/2 nature.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state, the four particles must fill the lowest possible energy levels.\n*   The n=1 level can hold two particles. Their total energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The n=2 level can hold the remaining two particles. Their total energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\n**E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E**\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nThe first excited state is achieved by the lowest-energy transition possible from the ground state configuration. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level, with a total energy of 2E.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level, with an energy of E₂ = 4E.\n*   One particle is promoted to the n=3 level, with an energy of E₃ = 3²E = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n**E_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E**\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nFor the second excited state, we consider the next lowest-energy configuration above the first excited state. There are two primary possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Promoting a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n2.  Promoting both particles from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nLet's calculate the total energy for each case:\n*   **Case 1 (n=1 → n=3 promotion):**\n    *   One particle in n=1: 1 × E₁ = 1E\n    *   Two particles in n=2: 2 × E₂ = 8E\n    *   One particle in n=3: 1 × E₃ = 9E\n    *   Total Energy = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\n*   **Case 2 (Two n=2 → n=3 promotions):**\n    *   Two particles in n=1: 2 × E₁ = 2E\n    *   Two particles in n=3: 2 × E₃ = 18E\n    *   Total Energy = 2E + 18E = 20E\n\nThe lower of these two energies is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n**E_second_excited = 18E**\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
