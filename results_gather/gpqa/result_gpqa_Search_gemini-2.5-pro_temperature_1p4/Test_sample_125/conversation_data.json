    "Here is a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave in the different chromatography systems.\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This ketone has one existing chiral center at the C5 position with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers. Since the starting material already has a chiral center at C5 that is unaffected by the reaction, the two products will be diastereomers:\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral β-diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of both ketones produces pentane-2,4-diol, which has two chiral centers at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R), which are identical due to a plane of symmetry)\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Product Analysis for HPLC\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nAnalyzing the peaks for the combined mixture on a normal-phase column:\n1.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is one of the diastereomers from Reaction I.\n2.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol:** This is the second diastereomer from Reaction I and will have a different retention time from the first.\n3.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** This compound is a diastereomer of the other pentane-2,4-diol products and will be separated.\n4.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This pair of enantiomers will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n\nAssuming the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different enough to have unique retention times, we would observe a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### Chiral Stationary Phase HPLC\n\nA chiral stationary phase provides a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\nAnalyzing the peaks for the combined mixture on a chiral column:\n1.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n2.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**\n3.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n4.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n5.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol**\n\nEach of these five compounds will be resolved, resulting in **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
