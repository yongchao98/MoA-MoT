  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The failure to express the GADD45G protein is because the ribosome terminated the translation prematurely. A detailed analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the specific reason.\n\nThe sequence begins with `5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGA...3'`. When this DNA is transcribed into mRNA and then translated into a protein, the process unfolds as follows:\n*   **`ATG`**: This is the universal start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). Translation begins here.\n*   **`TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`**: This sequence of 27 nucleotides codes for the 9-amino-acid sequence of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag, which is `YPYDVPDYA`. This part of the construct is correct.\n*   **`AAA`**: This codon specifies the amino acid Lysine (Lys).\n*   **`TGA`**: In the universal genetic code, this is one of the three stop codons (along with TAA and TAG). When the ribosome encounters this codon in the mRNA sequence (as UGA), it signals the termination of translation.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome initiates translation at the start codon (`ATG`), successfully synthesizes the HA tag and one additional amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately encounters the stop codon (`TGA`). This results in the production of a tiny, truncated peptide (Met-HA-tag-Lys), not the full-length GADD45G fusion protein. This premature termination is a type of nonsense mutation within the engineered construct and is the direct cause of the failed overexpression experiment.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **B) Lack of a linker sequence:** While linkers can be beneficial, their absence does not inherently cause a complete failure of expression. The problem here is more definitive.\n*   **C) Missense mutation in the antigenic determinant:** The sequence for the HA tag itself correctly codes for the standard `YPYDVPDYA` peptide. The mutation is a *nonsense* mutation (creating a stop codon) that occurs *after* the tag sequence.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist:** This is incorrect on two counts. First, the stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs. The absence of a corresponding tRNA is what allows termination to occur.\n\n<<<A>>>"
