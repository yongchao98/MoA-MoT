  "question": "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",
