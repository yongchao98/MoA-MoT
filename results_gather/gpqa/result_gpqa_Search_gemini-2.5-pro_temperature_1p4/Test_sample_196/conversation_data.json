    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Compound X from Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, using the provided Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data.\n\n**IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the downfield region is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is further upfield, suggesting it is next to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for a single proton, likely a methine (-CH-) group attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group attached to the methine proton.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, characteristic of a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the methylene group.\n    *   These signals together (methine, two different methyls, and a methylene) perfectly describe a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:**\nCombining all the spectral evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches the structure described in option (C).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction**\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is capable of the complete reduction of several functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   The reaction R-COOH + 6HI (in the presence of red P) yields R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O. The red phosphorus helps to regenerate HI by reacting with the iodine (I₂) produced.\n\n### **Step 3: Prediction of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** -COOH → -CH₃\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n### **Step 4: Matching with Options**\n\nLet's review the given choices:\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted final product.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
