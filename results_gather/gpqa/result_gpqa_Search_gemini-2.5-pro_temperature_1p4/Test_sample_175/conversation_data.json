    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Operators\n\n*   The unnormalized initial state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    `|ψ_un⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n*   The operator for observable P is the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n*   The operator for observable Q is the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n### 2. Normalize the Initial State\n\nFirst, we must normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of its components:\n`⟨ψ_un|ψ_un⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. Therefore, the normalized initial state is:\n`|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n### 3. First Measurement: Finding the Probability of getting 0 for P\n\nThe measurement of an observable collapses the state of the system into one of the eigenstates of the operator, and the result of the measurement is the corresponding eigenvalue. The probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n**a. Find the eigenvalues and the eigenvector for P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.**\nTo find the eigenvalues of P, we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - pI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -p, 1/√2, 0 ], [1/√2, -p, 1/√2 ], [ 0, 1/√2, -p ]]) = 0`\n`-p(p² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-p/√2) = 0`\n`-p³ + p/2 + p/2 = 0`\n`p - p³ = 0`\n`p(1 - p²) = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `p = 0, 1, -1`.\n\nWe are interested in the outcome `p = 0`. Now we find the corresponding eigenvector `|p₀⟩` by solving `P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩ = 0`:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\nThis yields the equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0  => x = -z`\n\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is of the form `(x, 0, -x)`. Let's choose `x=1`, so the vector is `(1, 0, -1)`.\nNormalizing this eigenvector: `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n**b. Calculate the probability of measuring p=0.**\nThe probability `Prob(p=0)` is given by `|⟨p₀|ψ⟩|²`.\n`⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)] · [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)]`\n`⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1] = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n`Prob(p=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n### 4. State Collapse After the First Measurement\n\nAfter measuring `P` and getting the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p₀⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n### 5. Second Measurement: Finding the Probability of getting -1 for Q\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n\n**a. Find the eigenvector for Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1.**\nThe operator Q is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: `1, 0, -1`. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. We are interested in the eigenvalue `q = -1`. The corresponding eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` is:\n`|q₋₁⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n\n**b. Calculate the probability of measuring q=-1 from the state `|ψ'⟩`.**\nThe probability `Prob(q=-1)` is given by `|⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`.\n`⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · [(1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)]`\n`⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)] = -1/√2`\n`Prob(q=-1 | p=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n### 6. Calculate the Joint Probability\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n\nTotal Probability = `Prob(p=0) × Prob(q=-1 | p=0)`\nTotal Probability = `(1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
