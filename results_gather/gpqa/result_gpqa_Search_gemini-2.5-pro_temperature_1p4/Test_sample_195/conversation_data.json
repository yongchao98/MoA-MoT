    "The derivation I performed in the thought process is confirmed by the principles of relativistic energy conservation.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Define the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude (x=A).**\n    *   At this point, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero.\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring is at its maximum: U = ½ kA².\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy of the mass and the potential energy of the spring.\n    *   E_total = mc² + ½ kA². This principle is supported by physics resources, which state that potential energy can be added to the total energy of a system.\n\n2.  **Define the total energy at the equilibrium position (x=0).**\n    *   At this point, the potential energy is zero.\n    *   The velocity is at its maximum, v_max.\n    *   The total energy is the relativistic energy of the moving mass.\n    *   E_total = γmc², where γ = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²). This is the standard formula for total relativistic energy.\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    *   The total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    *   mc² + ½ kA² = γmc²\n\n4.  **Solve for v_max.**\n    *   mc² + ½ kA² = [1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)] * mc²\n    *   Divide by mc²: 1 + (kA² / 2mc²) = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n    *   Invert both sides: 1 / [1 + kA² / (2mc²)] = √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n    *   Square both sides: 1 / [1 + kA² / (2mc²)]² = 1 - v_max²/c²\n    *   Rearrange: v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / [1 + kA² / (2mc²)]²\n    *   Take the square root and multiply by c: v_max = c√[1 - 1 / (1 + kA² / (2mc²))²]\n\nThis result matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
