    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine. This reaction is an α-bromination, where one hydrogen on the α-carbon is replaced by a bromine atom. The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 2:** Bromoacetic acid is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification reaction, which converts the carboxylic acid into an ethyl ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and replaces the bromine atom via an Sₙ2 reaction. The product is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). The alpha-protons in this molecule (the CH₂ group between the nitrile and the ester) are acidic.\n4.  **Product 4 (Final Product):** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n    *   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the newly formed product, which still has one acidic α-proton, is deprotonated again.\n    *   The resulting carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromine atom. This forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product (4) is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of the Final Product\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-C≡N) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 (cyano and ethoxycarbonyl) are different. Because of this, the molecule is chiral and has no plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation are chemically non-equivalent and should, in principle, produce a distinct signal.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the carbon-carbon single bond. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral environment (the rest of the molecule). In a strict sense, they are chemically different. However, in the context of introductory NMR problems, they are often treated as equivalent. Assuming this common simplification, they produce **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The ring contains 10 protons on carbons C2 through C6.\n    *   Since the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry, the protons on one side of the ring (e.g., C2 and C3) are not equivalent to the protons on the other side (e.g., C6 and C5).\n    *   Furthermore, on each individual carbon of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6), the two geminal protons (often designated as axial and equatorial in a chair conformation) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   This means all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct from one another. This gives **10 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring: 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 10 (from the ring) = **12 distinct signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 12 observable hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
