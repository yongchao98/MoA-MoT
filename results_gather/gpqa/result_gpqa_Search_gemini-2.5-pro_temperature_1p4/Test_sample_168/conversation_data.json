    "This nuclear decay problem can be understood by analyzing the particles in the final state and the principles of energy and momentum conservation.\n\n### Analysis of the Decay Processes\n\n1.  **Original Decay:** The process `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V` is analogous to two-neutrino double beta decay (`2n -> 2p + 2e⁻ + 2ν̅ₑ`). In this decay, the total energy released is shared among the four light final-state particles (the two E particles and the two V particles). Because the energy can be distributed in a nearly infinite number of ways among these particles, the total energy of the two E particles is not fixed. Instead, it forms a continuous spectrum, ranging from zero up to a maximum value, known as the endpoint Q. This continuous distribution is a characteristic signature of decays with more than two particles in the final state.\n\n2.  **Variant Decay:** The second process is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`. Here, the two V particles are replaced by a single, exotic massless particle M. This scenario is a known hypothetical decay called neutrinoless double beta decay with Majoron emission. In this case, the total decay energy is shared among three final-state particles (two E particles and the single M particle). Since there are still more than two bodies sharing the energy, the energy spectrum of the two E particles remains continuous. This immediately eliminates options suggesting a discrete spectrum.\n\n### Comparing the Endpoints\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum is determined by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value. The Q-value is calculated from the difference in mass between the initial and final particles (`Q = (m_initial - m_final)c²`).\n\n*   **Q-value of the original decay (Q₁):**\n    `Q₁ = Mass(2A) - [Mass(2B) + Mass(2E) + Mass(2V)]`\n    Since particles V are known to have a small but non-zero mass, `Mass(2V)` is positive.\n\n*   **Q-value of the variant decay (Q₂):**\n    `Q₂ = Mass(2A) - [Mass(2B) + Mass(2E) + Mass(M)]`\n    The problem states that particle M is massless, so `Mass(M) = 0`.\n\nComparing the two, the total mass of the final products is smaller in the variant decay because two massive particles (2V) are replaced by one massless particle (M). According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, a larger decrease in mass during the reaction results in a greater release of energy.\n\nTherefore, `Q₂` is greater than `Q₁`. Since the endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum corresponds to this Q-value, the endpoint of the variant decay will be higher than that of the original decay.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe new decay mode still involves three particles in the final state sharing the available energy, so the spectrum remains continuous with an altered shape. However, because a single massless particle replaces two particles with mass, the total energy released (the Q-value) is larger, causing the endpoint of the spectrum to increase.\n\n<<<B>>>"
