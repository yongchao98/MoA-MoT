    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning.\n\nFirst, the relationship between the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) and the star's radial velocity (v_r) is given by the Doppler formula: Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c. This confirms that the radial velocity is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift, so v_r ∝ Δλ. The semi-amplitude of the velocity variation, K, is therefore directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ_max). This gives K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nSecond, for a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the planet's mass (M_p), and the star's mass (M*) by the formula: K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M* + M_p)^(2/3). This formula is also presented in a slightly different but equivalent form in other sources.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that:\n*   The mass of the two stars is the same (M*₁ = M*₂).\n*   The mass of the two planets is the same (M_p₁ = M_p₂).\n*   Both orbits are circular.\n*   The problem does not specify the orbital inclination `i`, but it is reasonable to assume that the inclinations are similar or that the given shift already accounts for this factor (as `M_p * sin(i)` is the quantity usually determined). Assuming `sin(i)` is the same for both systems allows for a direct comparison.\n\nGiven these equalities, all terms in the formula for K are constant for both systems except for K itself and the orbital period P (which is the same as T in my initial derivation).\n\nTherefore, K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n\nThis leads to the relationship: K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3).\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the ratio of the periods, P₂ / P₁:\n(K₂ / K₁)^3 = P₁ / P₂\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ:\nP₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nΔλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\nΔλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result matches option B. The logic is sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n(5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364431...\nThe closest answer is 0.36.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\nHow many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nThe periodic shift in a spectral line, as detected by the Radial Velocity (RV) method, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K. Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocities is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the planet's mass (m_p), and the star's mass (M_star) through the following proportionality, derived from Kepler's laws and gravity:\n\nK ∝ (m_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))\n\nIn this problem, the masses of the stars are identical, and the masses of the planets are also identical. This means that all factors in the equation are the same for both systems, except for the velocity (K) and the period (P). This simplifies the relationship to:\n\nK ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis implies that the period is related to the velocity semi-amplitude by:\n\nP ∝ 1 / K³ or P ∝ K⁻³\n\nTo find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we can set up the following ratio:\n\n(P₂ / P₁) = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nWe already know that K₁ / K₂ is the inverse of the wavelength shift ratio, which is 5/7. Plugging this value into the equation:\n\n(P₂ / P₁) = (5 / 7)³\n(P₂ / P₁) = 125 / 343\n(P₂ / P₁) ≈ 0.3644\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
