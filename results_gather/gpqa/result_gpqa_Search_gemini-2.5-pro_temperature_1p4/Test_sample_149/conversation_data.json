    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the starting compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO based on the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet is a methylene group (-CH₂-). Its doublet splitting pattern confirms it is adjacent to the aldehyde's single proton, which is consistent with the aldehyde proton's triplet.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these pieces—a *para*-substituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH₂), and a -CH₂CHO group—leads to the starting material: **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. A check of its molecular formula (C₈H₉NO) confirms this structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). This reaction transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into (4-(formylmethyl)phenyl)diazonium chloride.\n\n2.  **H₂O:** Water is added to the diazonium salt. This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and releasing nitrogen gas. The product at this stage is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (potassium hydroxide) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), which are the required components for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbonyl of a second molecule, forming a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The initial product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation:** The presence of heat promotes a dehydration (or condensation) reaction. A molecule of water is eliminated from the β-hydroxy aldehyde to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The resulting double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group. This dehydration is a key feature of aldol reactions carried out at elevated temperatures. The final product is therefore **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nBy comparing the predicted final product with the given options:\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This matches the expected product from the aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nThe final product after the full reaction sequence, including heating, is the condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
