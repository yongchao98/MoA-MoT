    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to determine the final product E and its corresponding number of 13C-NMR signals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF₃ → A**\n    *   **Reactants**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) with a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃).\n    *   **Reaction**: This is the formation of a thioacetal. The carbonyl group of propionaldehyde reacts with the dithiol to form a 1,3-dithiolane.\n    *   **Product A**: The product is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**\n    *   **Reactants**: Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and butyllithium (BuLi).\n    *   **Reaction**: BuLi is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2). This forms a nucleophilic carbanion, a key step in umpolung (reactivity inversion).\n    *   **Product B**: The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**\n    *   **Reactants**: Product B (the carbanion) and bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n    *   **Reaction**: The nucleophilic carbanion of B attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction, adding an ethyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   **Product C**: The resulting product is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    *   **Reactants**: Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) with mercuric chloride, water, and acid.\n    *   **Reaction**: This is the hydrolysis (deprotection) of the thioacetal, which regenerates the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D**: The carbon that was part of the dithiolane ring (C2) becomes a carbonyl carbon, now bonded to the two ethyl groups. The product is diethyl ketone, also known as **3-pentanone** (CH₃CH₂COCH₂CH₃).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    *   **Reactants**: Product D (3-pentanone) and the reagents for a Wittig reaction.\n    *   **Reaction**: This is a Wittig olefination. First, a phosphorus ylide (Wittig reagent) is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), which is then deprotonated by BuLi. This ylide is Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂. The ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone. The C=O double bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C double bond from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E**: The reaction is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + Ph₃P=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + Ph₃PO. The final product is tetraethylethene, systematically named **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n### 13C-NMR Analysis of Product E\n\nThe final product, E, is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in the molecule. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a point of inversion and multiple symmetry elements that make all four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n*   **Chemically Equivalent Carbons**:\n    1.  **Alkene carbons (C=C)**: The two carbons forming the double bond are in identical chemical environments and are therefore equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n    2.  **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-)**: All four ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. Consequently, the four methylene carbons are also equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n    3.  **Methyl carbons (-CH₃)**: Similarly, the four methyl carbons at the ends of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nTherefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show a total of **3 signals**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
