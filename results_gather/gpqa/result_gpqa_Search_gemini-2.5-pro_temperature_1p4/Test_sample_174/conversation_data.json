    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it emits. The radiated power from such a dipole is not uniform in all directions.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this problem).\n\nThe maximum radiated power, A, occurs where sin²(θ) is at its maximum. The maximum value of sin(θ) is 1, which happens at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). Therefore, the maximum power A is proportional to sin²(90°) = 1.\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of the maximum power that is radiated at an angle of θ = 30°. To find this, we can calculate the ratio of the power at 30° to the maximum power:\n\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power A) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(90°) = 1, the fraction is:\n\nFraction = (1/2)² / 1² = 1/4\n\n### Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is also dependent on the frequency of oscillation. The total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency ω.\n\nP ∝ ω⁴\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency (ω), the speed of light (c), and wavelength (λ) is:\n\nω = 2πc / λ\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power, we find the dependence on wavelength:\n\nP ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis relationship, where the scattered or radiated power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, is also characteristic of Rayleigh scattering. The power radiated per unit solid angle, represented by the function *f*, will therefore have a wavelength dependence of λ⁻⁴.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4, and the possible form of the function *f* includes a wavelength dependence of λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
