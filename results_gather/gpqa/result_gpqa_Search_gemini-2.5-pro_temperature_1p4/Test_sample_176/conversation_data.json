    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L₂).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where:\n        *   L is the luminosity (total power radiated).\n        *   R is the star's radius.\n        *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n        *   T is the star's surface temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Analyze the given information on radius:** We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n\n4.  **Analyze the information on wavelength:** The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the observed spectrum. We are also given the radial velocities:\n    *   v₁ = 0 km/s\n    *   v₂ = 700 km/s (receding)\n\n5.  **Consider the Doppler Effect:** Because Star_2 is moving, the light we observe from it is subject to a Doppler shift. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the intrinsic, or rest, wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula for non-relativistic speeds:\n    *   λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)\n    *   Where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Relate observed wavelengths to rest wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1 (v₁ = 0), the observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest peak wavelength: λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁.\n    *   For Star_2 (v₂ = 700 km/s), its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength is: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since the problem states λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have: λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n\n7.  **Apply Wien's Displacement Law:** Wien's law states that the intrinsic peak wavelength of a black body's emission is inversely proportional to its temperature (λ_rest = b/T), where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant. Therefore, T is inversely proportional to λ_rest.\n    *   T ∝ 1/λ_rest\n\n8.  **Determine the temperature ratio:** From Wien's Law, the ratio of the temperatures of the two stars is:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁\n    *   Substituting the relationship from the Doppler effect (step 6): T₁ / T₂ = λ_rest₂ / [λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)]\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n9.  **Calculate the luminosity ratio:** Now, we set up the ratio of the luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    *   The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out: L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n10. **Substitute the known ratios and values:**\n    *   We know R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    *   We found T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   The velocity of Star_2 is v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s.\n    *   The speed of light is c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + (7x10⁵ / 3x10⁸))]⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936\n    *   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n11. **Final Answer:** The calculated factor is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23. The information regarding the mass of the stars is not relevant to this calculation, which is based on the principles of black body radiation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
