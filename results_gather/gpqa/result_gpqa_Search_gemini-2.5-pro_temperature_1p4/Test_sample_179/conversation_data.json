    "### Determining the Minimum Energy of a Charged Particle System\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the described system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with a charge `q = 2e`. One particle is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 are constrained to a spherical surface of radius `r = 2 m` centered at P.\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  `U_center_sphere`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_sphere_sphere`: The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the spherical surface.\n\nFor the system to be in a state of minimum energy, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion. This is a classic physics problem known as the **Thomson problem**. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is achieved when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n**1. Calculation of `U_center_sphere`**\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge and any single charge on the sphere is given by Coulomb's Law. Since the distance is always the radius `r = 2 m`, the total energy for the 12 charges is:\n\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q^2) / r`\n\nGiven that `q = 2e`, this becomes:\n\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / 2 = 24 * k * e^2`\n\nHere, `k` is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²) and `e` is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C).\n\n**2. Calculation of `U_sphere_sphere`**\n\nTo calculate the interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere, we must consider the distances between the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in the sphere of radius `r=2 m`. For any given vertex on an icosahedron, the other 11 vertices are at specific distances:\n*   **5 adjacent vertices** at a distance `s` (the edge length of the icosahedron).\n*   **5 \"second-nearest\" vertices** at a distance `s * φ`, where `φ` is the golden ratio (approximately 1.618).\n*   **1 antipodal vertex** at a distance of `2r`.\n\nThe number of unique pairs of vertices is 66. These pairs can be categorized by their separation distance:\n*   30 pairs are separated by the edge length `s`.\n*   30 pairs are separated by `s * φ`.\n*   6 pairs are antipodal, separated by `2r`.\n\nThe edge length `s` of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r` is `s ≈ 1.05146 * r`. For `r = 2 m`, `s ≈ 2.1029 m`.\n\nThe total potential energy of the charges on the sphere is the sum of the energies of all 66 pairs:\n\n`U_sphere_sphere = k * q^2 * [30/s + 30/(s*φ) + 6/(2r)]`\n\nSubstituting `q = 2e`, `r = 2 m`, and the calculated value for `s`, we get:\n\n`U_sphere_sphere = 4 * k * e^2 * [30/2.1029 + 30/(2.1029 * 1.618) + 3/2]`\n`U_sphere_sphere ≈ 98.331 * k * e^2`\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Minimum Energy**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U_total = 24 * k * e^2 + 98.331 * k * e^2`\n`U_total = 122.331 * k * e^2`\n\nNow, we substitute the values for the constants `k` and `e`:\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n*   `k * e^2 ≈ 2.307077 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m`\n\n`U_total ≈ 122.331 * (2.307077 × 10⁻²⁸ J·m)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
