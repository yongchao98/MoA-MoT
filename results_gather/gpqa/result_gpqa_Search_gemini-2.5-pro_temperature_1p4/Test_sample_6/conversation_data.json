    "To determine the energy at which a high-energy gamma-ray's ($\\gamma$) lifetime is limited by annihilation with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon, we need to calculate the threshold energy for electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$) pair production. The reaction is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nThe calculation for the threshold energy is based on the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. For the reaction to be possible, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the rest mass of an electron and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe threshold energy ($E_\\gamma$) for the high-energy photon can be found using the following formula, which corresponds to a head-on collision for the most efficient energy use:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon_{CMB}}$\n\nHere, $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron, and $\\epsilon_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n\nThe required physical constants are:\n*   **Electron rest mass energy ($m_e c^2$)**: This is approximately 0.511 MeV (Mega-electron Volts).\n*   **Average energy of a CMB photon ($\\epsilon_{CMB}$)**: This is given in the problem as $10^{-3}$ eV (electron Volts).\n\nFirst, we need to ensure all units are consistent. Let's convert the electron's rest mass energy from MeV to eV:\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the threshold energy formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe options are given in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), so we need to convert our result from eV to GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nRewriting this in scientific notation gives:\n\n$E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value is very close to the option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
