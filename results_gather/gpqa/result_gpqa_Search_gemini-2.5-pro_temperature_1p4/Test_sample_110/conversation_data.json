    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The process involves the formation of a nucleophile from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong and sterically hindered base. It will remove an acidic α-hydrogen from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   It has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, and two other carbons) and has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The C6 carbon is tertiary and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position, forming the corresponding enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate nucleophile attacks the ethyl acrylate (a Michael acceptor) at the β-carbon. This is a conjugate (or 1,4-) addition.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** The resulting product is `6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one`. To name this according to the format in the options (`ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`), the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent. The IUPAC rules for naming such substituents state that the point of attachment to the main chain (the propanoate) is numbered as C1 of the ring.\n    *   **New Numbering for Naming:**\n        *   The original C6 (the point of attachment) becomes the new C1.\n        *   The original C1 (the carbonyl carbon) becomes the new C2.\n        *   The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) becomes the new C3.\n    *   **Identifying Substituents with New Numbers:**\n        *   At the new C1: a methyl group.\n        *   At the new C2: an oxo group.\n        *   At the new C3: an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Arranging these alphabetically gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Thus, the full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition, specifically a nitro-Michael reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The protons on the carbon adjacent to a nitro group are acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n    *   The structure of but-2-enenitrile is `CH₃–CH(β)=CH(α)–CN`.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the deprotonated 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`) attacks the β-carbon.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile chain.\n    *   The resulting carbon skeleton is: `CH₃CH₂–CH(NO₂) –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile group. This is a six-carbon chain, making it a derivative of hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   Substituents are located at:\n        *   C3: a methyl group.\n        *   C4: a nitro group.\n    *   Therefore, the name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
