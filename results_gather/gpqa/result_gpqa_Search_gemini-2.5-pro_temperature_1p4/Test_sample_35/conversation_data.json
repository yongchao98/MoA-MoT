    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical transition:** The first step is to determine what physical process corresponds to an energy of 3.9 micro-electron volts (µeV). This is a very low energy, characteristic of transitions in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The most important spectral line in radio astronomy for studying the interstellar medium is the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI).\n\n2.  **Calculate the rest energy of the 21 cm line:** The 21 cm line corresponds to the hyperfine \"spin-flip\" transition in a neutral hydrogen atom. This transition has a rest frequency of 1420.4 MHz. Using the Planck-Einstein relation (E = hν), we can calculate its energy:\n    *   E = (4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) × (1420.4 × 10⁶ s⁻¹) ≈ 5.87 × 10⁻⁶ eV, or 5.87 µeV.\n\n3.  **Account for cosmological redshift:** The observed energy (3.9 µeV) is lower than the rest energy (5.87 µeV) of the 21 cm line. This is due to cosmological redshift, as the light from the distant structure has been stretched on its journey to us. The relationship is E_observed = E_rest / (1 + z), where 'z' is the redshift.\n    *   1 + z = E_rest / E_observed = 5.87 µeV / 3.9 µeV ≈ 1.5\n    *   z ≈ 0.5\n\n4.  **Verify the distance:** The problem states the structure is at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc). A redshift of z ≈ 0.5 corresponds to a comoving distance of approximately 2.1 Gpc in the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM). This confirms that the observed absorption line is indeed the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen, originating from gas associated with the distant structure.\n\n5.  **Interpret the question:** The question asks what is *most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way*. This means, what does the 21 cm absorption line typically trace within our own galaxy?\n\n6.  **Relate the 21 cm line to the Interstellar Medium (ISM):** The 21 cm line is an excellent tracer of the neutral atomic component of the ISM. The ISM has multiple phases, including cold, dense phases and warm, diffuse phases.\n    *   **21 cm emission** is seen from all neutral hydrogen gas.\n    *   **21 cm absorption**, however, occurs when there is a cloud of neutral hydrogen in front of a bright, background radio source. The strength of this absorption is inversely proportional to the temperature of the hydrogen gas. Therefore, 21 cm absorption is a much more sensitive probe of the *cold atomic interstellar medium* (temperatures of tens to a few hundred Kelvin) than the warm atomic medium (temperatures of thousands of Kelvin). While molecular clouds are also cold, they are primarily traced by molecules like CO, not the HI 21 cm line.\n\n**Conclusion:** The absorption line is the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. In the Milky Way, observations of this line *in absorption* are the primary method for studying the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
