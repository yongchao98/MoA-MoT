    "The transition from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state in a hydrogen atom via two sequential electric dipole transitions must follow specific selection rules. This type of decay is also known as a cascade transition.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n1.  **First Transition:** The initial state is $|n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n    *   According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* of the intermediate state must be 1.\n    *   The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the magnetic quantum number *m* of the intermediate state to be -1, 0, or +1.\n    *   Energy must be released, so the principal quantum number *n* of the intermediate state must be less than 3. The most probable transition is to n=2.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Second Transition:** The intermediate state must decay to the final state $|n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$.\n    *   For an intermediate state $|2,1,m\\rangle$, a transition to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ satisfies the selection rules: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$ and $\\Delta m$ will be $0-m$, which is allowed for $m=0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Transition Probability:** The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This refers to the branching ratio of the first decay step from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the possible $|2,1,m\\rangle$ states.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an *s*-orbital, which is spherically symmetric.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon.\n    *   Consequently, the decay rates to each of the three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$) are equal.\n    *   Since there are three equally probable decay channels, the probability (or branching ratio) for any single channel is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the valid transition routes are $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, and $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, each having a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ for the first step.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n\nThus, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
