    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial reaction and identify Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane has a tricyclic cage structure.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). These are harsh conditions known to cause rearrangements and fragmentations in caged systems.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration (2+10+2 = 14H) corresponds to the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone in a six-membered or unstrained ring.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm is in the vinylic region, indicating the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The presence of a 2H signal suggests a symmetrically substituted double bond of the type R-CH=CH-R.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** Product 1 is an unsaturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The degrees of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is 4. This corresponds to two rings, one C=C bond, and one C=O bond, meaning Product 1 is a bicyclic unsaturated ketone. The adamantane cage has opened.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃). This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Transformation:** The MPV reduction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond remains intact.\n*   **Product 2:** Product 2 is an unsaturated alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O. It is a bicyclic structure containing a C=C double bond and a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n*   **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond. A reductive workup with DMS converts the initial ozonide product into two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n*   **Analysis of Cleavage:** The ¹H NMR of Product 1 indicated a symmetric `R-CH=CH-R` double bond. Ozonolysis of this feature in Product 2 will result in the formation of two aldehyde groups (-CHO).\n*   **Product 3:** The cleavage of the C=C bond breaks one of the rings in the bicyclic structure of Product 2. Therefore, Product 3 is a monocyclic molecule. Its full structure is a C₁₀ dialdehyde-alcohol (formula C₁₀H₁₆O₃). The two aldehyde groups are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry of the precursor.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded protons (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) will be the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO). Aldehyde protons typically have a chemical shift in the range of 9-10 ppm.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** The splitting pattern of an aldehyde proton depends on the number of protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon).\n    *   `...-C(R)₂-CHO`: The aldehyde proton is a singlet (0 α-protons).\n    *   `...-CHR-CHO`: The aldehyde proton is a doublet (1 α-proton).\n    *   `...-CH₂-CHO`: The aldehyde proton is a triplet (2 α-protons).\n*   **Deduction from Structure:** Since the double bond in the precursor was `-CH=CH-`, the carbons α to the resulting aldehyde groups were the carbons adjacent to the double bond in the precursor. Without a definitive structure for the intermediate, we must rely on the answer choices. The absence of a \"doublet\" in the options makes it highly unlikely that the α-carbon is a CH group. Therefore, the α-carbon is most likely a CH₂ group. This would result in a triplet.\n*   **Considering Long-Range Coupling:** In many organic systems, especially cyclic ones, coupling extends beyond the adjacent carbon. The aldehyde proton in a `...-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CHO` fragment will couple to both the α-protons (causing a triplet) and the β-protons. Coupling to the two β-protons would split the signal into another triplet. This results in a **triplet of triplets** pattern. This is a common and expected splitting pattern for such a fragment, where the alpha coupling constant is larger than the beta coupling constant. Given the complexity of the other options, this is the most chemically sound description.\n\nBased on this deduction, the fragment in Product 3 is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CHO`. The aldehyde proton signal is split into a triplet by the two α-protons, and each of those lines is further split into a triplet by the two β-protons.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
