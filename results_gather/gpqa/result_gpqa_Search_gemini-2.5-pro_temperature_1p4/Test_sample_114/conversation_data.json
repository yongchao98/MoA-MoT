    "### Calculation Determines Photon Angle in Electron-Positron Annihilation\n\nWhen an electron with a Lorentz factor of 4 collides with a positron moving in the opposite direction with a Lorentz factor of 2, the resulting annihilation produces two photons. Based on the principles of special relativity, the angle between the paths of these two photons is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in the fundamental laws of conservation of energy and momentum. First, the initial total energy and momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision must be calculated.\n\nThe energy (E) of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The momentum (p) is given by p = γmv, where v is the velocity. The velocity can be expressed in terms of the Lorentz factor as v = c√(1 - 1/γ²).\n\n**Initial State:**\n\n*   **Electron:** With a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4, its energy is 4mc² and its momentum is mc√(4² - 1) = mc√15, moving in the positive direction.\n*   **Positron:** With a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2, its energy is 2mc² and its momentum is mc√(2² - 1) = mc√3, moving in the negative direction.\n\nThe total initial energy is the sum of their individual energies: E_total = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc².\nThe total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta, taking direction into account: P_total = (mc√15 - mc√3) in the positive direction.\n\n**Final State:**\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced. Since their energies are measured to be equal, let the energy of each photon be E_γ. According to the conservation of energy:\nE_total = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n6mc² = 2E_γ\nE_γ = 3mc²\n\nThis means each resulting photon has an energy of 3mc².\n\nFor momentum to be conserved, the total final momentum of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum. The problem states one photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This implies their vertical (y-axis) momenta are equal and opposite, cancelling each other out, which is consistent with the initial vertical momentum being zero.\n\nLet θ be the angle of each photon's path relative to the horizontal axis. The horizontal momentum of a photon is (E_γ/c)cos(θ).\nP_total = (E_γ/c)cos(θ) + (E_γ/c)cos(θ) = 2(E_γ/c)cos(θ)\n\nSubstituting the known values for P_total and E_γ:\nmc(√15 - √3) = 2(3mc²/c)cos(θ)\nmc(√15 - √3) = 6mc cos(θ)\n\nSolving for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nThis gives an angle θ of approximately 69.1 degrees.\n\nThe question asks for the total angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\nAngle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to the provided option C. When the initial net momentum is not zero, the photons are emitted at an angle less than 180 degrees.\n\n<<<C>>>"
