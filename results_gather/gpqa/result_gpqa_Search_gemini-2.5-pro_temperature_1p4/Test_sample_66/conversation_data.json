    "To determine the joint probability, we need to express the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$ in terms of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$. The coefficients in this expansion are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The system consists of two electrons in a p orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The coupled state is given by $|l, m> = |2, -1>$.\n*   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and obtaining the eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where the magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the amplitude of the desired uncoupled state in the expansion of the coupled state. This amplitude is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$.\n\nSo, we need to find the probability $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$.\n\nA fundamental selection rule for the addition of angular momenta is that the total magnetic quantum number *m* must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n*   $m = -1$ (from the coupled state $|2, -1>$)\n*   $m_1 = -1$ (for the measurement of $L_{1z}$)\n*   $m_2 = -1$ (for the measurement of $L_{2z}$)\n\nLet's check if the selection rule is satisfied:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince $m = -1$ is not equal to $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, the condition is not met.\n\nBecause the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ is zero. Consequently, the probability of finding the system in the state where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is also zero.\n\nThe coupled state $|2, -1>$ is a superposition of states for which $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible combinations for $(m_1, m_2)$ are $(0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$. The state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ where $m_1+m_2 = -2$ is not a component of the $|2, -1>$ state.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
