    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials for both reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe goal is to identify the starting materials A and B for the following two reactions:\n\n*   **Reaction A:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction B:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both reactions is a δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This molecule has a chiral center at the 4th carbon, which bears the ethyl group. The reactions produce the (R) and (S) enantiomers, respectively.\n\nThe proposed starting materials are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid, with the chemical structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu. This molecule possesses two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The key to solving this problem lies in the differing selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n### **Reagent Selectivity**\n\n1.  **Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄):** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that is more reactive than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) but less so than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Critically, LiBH₄ is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The reduction of an ester yields a primary alcohol.\n\n2.  **Borane (BH₃):** Borane, often used as a complex with THF or dimethyl sulfide, is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids over esters. The reduction of a carboxylic acid also produces a primary alcohol.\n\n### **Stereochemistry**\n\nIn both reaction pathways, the chiral center at the 3rd carbon of the starting material (the carbon with the ethyl group) is not involved in the reduction or the subsequent cyclization. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration (R or S) is retained in the final lactone product, where it becomes the C4 chiral center.\n\n### **Reaction A Breakdown**\n\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group.\n*   **Starting Material (A):** HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction):** The ester group (-COO-iBu) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the carboxylic acid group remains unchanged. This forms 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n*   **Step 2 (Lactonization):** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction produces **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and the stereocenter is preserved, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Reaction B Breakdown**\n\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Starting Material (B):** HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n*   **Step 1 (Reduction):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group untouched. This forms isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    *   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu → HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu\n*   **Step 2 (Lactonization):** The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction produces **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and the stereocenter is preserved, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
