    "Radioactive decay is a memoryless process, meaning the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability. We only need to calculate the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):**\n    The probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) for a time *t* is given by the formula P(survival) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so the probability of survival is:\n    P(survive 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n    We can use this to find λ:\n    0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n    Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(0.68) = -100λ\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of survival for the next 150 minutes:**\n    Because the process is memoryless, we calculate the probability of a fresh atom surviving for 150 minutes.\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150)\n\n    Substitute the expression for λ we found in step 1:\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^[-1.5 * ln(0.68)]\n    Using the logarithmic property a * ln(b) = ln(b^a):\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^[ln(0.68^-1.5)]  - wait, that seems wrong. Let me re-check the algebra.\n\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^((-ln(0.68)/100) * 150)\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^(1.5 * -ln(0.68))\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^(1.5 * ln(1/0.68)) - or simply\n    P(survive 150 min) = e^(-1.5 * ln(0.68)) = (e^ln(0.68))^-1.5 = 0.68^1.5. No, the math was:\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.\n    -λ*150 = -(-ln(0.68)/100) * 150 = (ln(0.68)/100) * 150 = 1.5 * ln(0.68).\n    So, P(survive 150 min) = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = e^(ln(0.68^1.5)) = 0.68^1.5.\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n    0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5584\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay:**\n    The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of it surviving.\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survive 150 min)\n    P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5584 = 0.4416\n\n4.  **Convert to a percentage and compare with options:**\n    0.4416 is equivalent to 44.16%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
