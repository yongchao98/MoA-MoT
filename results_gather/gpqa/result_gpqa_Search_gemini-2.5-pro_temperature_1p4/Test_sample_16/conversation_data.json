    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we must consider the dissociation equilibrium of the complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻) is given by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (also called the stability constant), for this equilibrium is:\nK_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe problem involves the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium for this dissociation is described by the dissociation constant, K_d, which is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species      | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|--------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| CaY²⁻        | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| Ca²⁺         | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| Y⁴⁻          | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\nThe \"ideal pH\" assumption means we can consider the fully deprotonated EDTA (Y⁴⁻) as the ligand, without needing to account for protonated forms of EDTA, which would require a conditional formation constant.\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [CaY²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the complex is very stable, and the amount of dissociation (x) will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
