    "To determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance, we need to perform a series of calculations based on the provided energy, mass, and decay width.\n\n1.  **Calculate the mean lifetime (τ):** The lifetime of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). The relationship is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s).\n    *   Γ = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n    *   τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s) / 0.320 GeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor accounts for the effects of special relativity and is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass (m).\n    *   γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.667\n\n3.  **Calculate the relativistic velocity factor (β):** This factor is the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light (c) and can be derived from the Lorentz factor.\n    *   β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(6.667)²) ≈ √0.9775 ≈ 0.9887\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L):** The mean distance a relativistic particle travels before decaying is its velocity (βc) multiplied by its dilated lifetime (γτ). An equivalent and often more direct formula is L = γβcτ.\n    *   L ≈ 6.667 * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nAlternatively, we can use a combined constant, ħc (the reduced Planck constant times the speed of light), which is approximately 1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m. The formula for the mean decay length becomes L = γβ(ħc/Γ).\n\n*   L ≈ 6.667 * 0.9887 * (1.973 x 10⁻¹⁶ GeV·m / 0.320 GeV)\n*   L ≈ 6.591 * (6.166 x 10⁻¹⁶ m)\n*   L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<C>>>"
