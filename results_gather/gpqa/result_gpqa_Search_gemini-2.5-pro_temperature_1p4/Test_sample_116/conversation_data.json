    "Here is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a type of substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in such compounds due to restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. The bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') sterically hinder free rotation. This restriction can create two stable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), making the molecule optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism. Due to this chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers ((R) and (S) forms) and is, therefore, optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone, (C6H5)2CO, features a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral, meaning they are superimposable on their mirror images and thus do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid ester. It has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and is, therefore, achiral and not optically active. Its geometric isomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), has a plane of symmetry and is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
