    "The observations provided strongly indicate the presence of isomers, which are molecules with the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, but different arrangements of atoms.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence and an evaluation of the options:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data**: The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to the expected one proton, signifies that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Because these environments are roughly equally populated (equal integrals) and distinct on the NMR timescale, this points to two stable or slowly interconverting species. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out.\n*   **LC-MS Data**: The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species. They are separable by liquid chromatography (two peaks) and they are isomers because they have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. The separation by LC and the equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the NMR data.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: This is incorrect. Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral NMR solvent and with a standard, achiral LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single peak in both the NMR and the LC-MS.\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This is incorrect. A \"double coupling\" side reaction would result in a product with a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. The MS data shows that both components have a mass consistent with the *expected* molecule, ruling out this type of impurity.\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: This is incorrect. As with option B, a precursor from the synthesis would have a different chemical structure and mass from the final product. The MS data refutes this possibility.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: This is the most plausible explanation. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties and are therefore distinguishable by both NMR and LC.\n    *   In the context of a synthesized peptide, diastereomers can arise in two main ways:\n        1.  **Epimerization**: One of the chiral centers of an amino acid may have inverted during the synthesis, leading to a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., an L-L dipeptide contaminated with a D-L dipeptide).\n        2.  **Atropisomerism (*cis*/*trans* isomerization)**: The rotation around an amide bond in a peptide is restricted. This can lead to the existence of stable rotational isomers (rotamers or atropisomers), most commonly observed as *cis* and *trans* conformations around a peptide bond, particularly those involving a proline residue. These *cis* and *trans* rotamers are a specific type of diastereomer and are well-known to give rise to two sets of signals in NMR spectra and can be separated by LC. The alpha-proton is in a very different chemical environment in the *cis* versus the *trans* isomer, leading to two distinct chemical shifts. The observation of two separable species of equal mass and population fits this phenomenon perfectly.\n\nGiven that all evidence points to two isomeric forms of the same molecule that are not enantiomers, a mixture of diastereomers is the correct conclusion. The specific phenomenon is most likely *cis-trans* isomerism around an amide bond, a classic example of diastereomerism in peptides.\n\n<<<D>>>"
