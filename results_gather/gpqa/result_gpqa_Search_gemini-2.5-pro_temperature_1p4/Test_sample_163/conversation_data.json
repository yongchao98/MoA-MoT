    "The search results confirm the validity of the formula used. Several sources (,,) explain that for a spectroscopic binary, the total mass can be determined using Kepler's Third Law combined with the measured radial velocities and period.\n\nSpecifically for a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocities of both stars (K1 and K2) are known, the total mass (M1 + M2) is related to the period (P) and the sum of the velocity amplitudes. The formula derived in the thought process is correct:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nSince the problem states that the systems exhibit eclipses, they are eclipsing binaries. This implies the inclination angle (i) is very close to 90 degrees, so sin(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the calculation as the sin³(i) term can be considered equal to 1.\n\nThe ratio of the masses of the two systems is therefore:\n\nM_system1 / M_system2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1a = 10 km/s\n*   K1b = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2a = 15 km/s\n*   K2b = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\nThe steps and the formula are validated, and the calculation is straightforward. The result of 0.432 strongly supports option A.\n\nFinal check of the question and my interpretation:\n*   \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" - This asks for the ratio M1 / M2.\n*   \"Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\" - Confirms I should use the total mass.\n*   Eclipse periods are given, justifying sin(i) ≈ 1.\n*   Radial velocity amplitudes are given.\n\nEverything seems correct.\n\nTo provide the final answer in the requested format, I will output <<<A>>>.Based on the principles of orbital mechanics applied to binary star systems, the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary can be determined from the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars. Since both systems are observed to have eclipses, we can assume their orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees, simplifying the calculations.\n\nThe total mass (M) of such a system is proportional to its orbital period (P) and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2). The formula is:\n\nM ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\nTo find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can set up a ratio of their masses (M1 / M2).\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio of the masses:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (Sum of amplitudes_1)³] / [P2 * (Sum of amplitudes_2)³]\n\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculation shows that the mass of system_1 is approximately 0.432 times the mass of system_2. This value is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
