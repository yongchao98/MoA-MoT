    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the structure of the compound based on the information provided.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Core Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆). It contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This means the two substituents together must contribute 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n2.  **Functional Groups from FTIR:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly attached to the benzene ring).\n3.  **Identifying the Substituents:** One substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the two remaining carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nCombining these pieces, the compound is a halo-acetophenone. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group.\n\nNow, we need to analyze the ¹H NMR data to determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) and identify the correct spectrum.\n\n*   **Expected ¹H NMR signals for a halo-acetophenone:**\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH₃):** This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not coupled to any other protons, so it should appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3 hydrogens (3H). Its typical chemical shift is in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. Their splitting pattern depends on the relative positions of the substituents.\n        *   **Para (1,4) substitution:** This symmetrical arrangement results in two distinct sets of equivalent protons. This typically produces a pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 hydrogens (2H).\n        *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) substitution:** These patterns are less symmetrical and would lead to more complex multiplets, not typically described as two simple doublets.\n\nLet's examine the given NMR data options:\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not an acetyl group. An aldehyde would also lead to a different carbon count (7 total carbons), which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), which is essential for an aromatic compound.\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option shows only one aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have four). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic range.\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the expectations for a para-substituted halo-acetophenone.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for three protons, consistent with the -COCH₃ group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, causing the adjacent protons to appear further downfield (at 7.8 ppm). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing, but less so than the acetyl group, hence its adjacent protons are at a slightly lower chemical shift (7.6 ppm).\n\nPublished spectral data for compounds like 4-chloroacetophenone and 4-bromoacetophenone confirm these assignments. For example, the ¹H NMR spectrum of 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet at ~2.6 ppm (3H) and two doublets in the aromatic region at ~7.45 ppm (2H) and ~7.91 ppm (2H). Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at 2.60 ppm and two doublets at 7.61-7.63 ppm and 7.83-7.84 ppm. The data in option D is highly consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
