    "Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when a system that is symmetric with respect to some symmetry group enters a vacuum state that is not symmetric. According to Goldstone's theorem, for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a massless particle, known as a Nambu-Goldstone boson, must exist. In real-world systems, if the symmetry is only approximate, these particles are not strictly massless but are relatively light and are called pseudo-Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **Pion (B):** Pions are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. If the up and down quarks were massless, chiral symmetry would be exact, and the pions would be massless Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **Magnon (C):** In magnetic materials such as ferromagnets, the individual atomic spins align in a particular direction below a critical temperature, spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry of the system. The collective excitations of these aligned spins are quantized as particles called magnons, which are the Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken symmetry.\n\n*   **Phonon (D):** A crystal lattice consists of a regular, periodic arrangement of atoms, which breaks the continuous translational symmetry of empty space. The collective, quantized vibrations of the atoms in this lattice are known as phonons. Phonons are considered the Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry.\n\n*   **Skyrmion (A):** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like solution of a nonlinear field theory. Skyrmions were originally proposed as a model for baryons (like protons and neutrons) formed from pion fields. While the pion fields themselves arise from spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, the skyrmion is a topologically non-trivial excitation *of* these fields; it is not the Goldstone boson itself. In condensed matter physics, skyrmions appear as magnetic vortices in systems where symmetries are spontaneously broken. However, they are distinct from the Goldstone bosons (magnons) that also exist in these systems. Therefore, the skyrmion is a topological soliton that exists in a state of broken symmetry, rather than being the Goldstone boson that is a direct consequence of the symmetry breaking.\n\nBased on this, the pion, magnon, and phonon are all directly identified as Goldstone (or pseudo-Goldstone) bosons of a spontaneously broken symmetry. The skyrmion is a different kind of entity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
