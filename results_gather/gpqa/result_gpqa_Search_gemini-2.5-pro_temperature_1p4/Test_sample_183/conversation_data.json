    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequences provided in the options to determine the correct path for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule Analysis:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The relationship between the directing effects of the groups is crucial. The ethoxy group is a strong *ortho, para*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. The nitro group is a *meta*-director. Achieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern often requires a multi-step strategy involving blocking groups or manipulation of functional groups (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction).\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group, which is a good strategy. However, step (iv) reduces the nitro group to an amine (Fe/HCl), and step (vi) attempts a nitration on a diazonium salt intermediate, which is chemically unsound in this context. The sequence does not logically lead to the final product.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence begins with the nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, this pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence has a fatal flaw at step (iv). It calls for the use of NaNO₂/HCl, which is used to create a diazonium salt from a primary aromatic amine. However, the substrate at this stage, 2-(tert-butyl)-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not contain an amino group, making this step impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence carefully, as it represents the most plausible (though complex) synthetic route among the choices.\n    1.  **i) `tert`-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form *tert*-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of *tert*-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the *tert*-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, 1-(*tert*-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene, which allows for a high-yield separation from the minor *ortho* isomer.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group of 1-(*tert*-butyl)-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)aniline.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 4-(*tert*-butyl)aniline. The amino group (-NH₂) is a powerful activating *ortho, para*-director. Since the *para* position is blocked by the *tert*-butyl group, nitration occurs at one of the equivalent *ortho* positions (C2 or C6), yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitroaniline.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amino group of 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt. This is a standard diazotization reaction.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding 4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenolic hydroxyl group is deprotonated by NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form an ethoxy group. This produces 1-ethoxy-4-(*tert*-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene.\n    8.  **viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ & ix) dilute H₂SO₄:** These final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are chemically nonsensical in this position after the target-like molecule has been synthesized and would not contribute to the formation of the desired product. It is highly probable that these steps are erroneously included in the option.\n\nHowever, when comparing the molecule synthesized through steps (i) to (vii) of option D, **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, with the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, it becomes clear they are not the same isomer. There appears to be a discrepancy between the provided options and the exact structure named in the question.\n\nGiven the common patterns in multistep synthesis problems of this nature, it is most likely that Option D describes a valid, high-yield synthesis pathway for a specific trisubstituted benzene, and it is the most chemically sound choice among the flawed alternatives, despite the final product not matching the name perfectly and the inclusion of superfluous final steps. The core of the synthesis (steps i-vii) is logical and follows established organic chemistry principles for directing group effects and functional group interconversions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
