    "All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except:\n\nA) **Correct.** Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It allows for the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, from the same genomic region. This process is mediated by a highly structured RNA element downstream of a \"slippery sequence.\" The ribosome pauses at this structure—a three-stemmed H-type pseudoknot—and slips back by one nucleotide (-1 frameshift). Structural analyses have confirmed that the pseudoknot from SARS-CoV-2 is nearly identical in topology and conformation to the one found in SARS-CoV.\n\nB) **Incorrect.** The nsp14/nsp10 complex is a critical component of the virus's replication-transcription machinery, possessing a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity that is vital for proofreading. This function involves the *removal* of mismatched nucleotides from the growing RNA strand to ensure high-fidelity replication. The complex acts by *hydrolyzing* or degrading both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA to correct errors. The statement that it *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA is contrary to its known function as an RNA nuclease.\n\nC) **Correct.** The accessory protein ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 is known to induce apoptosis in host cells. Studies have shown that it specifically triggers the activation and cleavage of caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) apoptotic pathway. These same studies observed that ORF3a does not alter the expression levels of Bcl-2, a central protein in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Therefore, the evidence strongly indicates that ORF3a-mediated apoptosis occurs via the extrinsic pathway.\n\nD) **Correct.** The efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is not just dependent on a static RNA structure but also on its conformational dynamics. A linear correlation has been observed between the rate of frameshifting and the number of distinct conformations that the pseudoknot can adopt. For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, their frameshifting elements exhibit two main conformations when under tension, a characteristic shared with other viral pseudoknots that induce frameshifting at comparable rates.\n\n<<<B>>>"
