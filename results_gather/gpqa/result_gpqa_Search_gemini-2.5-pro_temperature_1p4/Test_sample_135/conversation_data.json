    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**, we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem is a fundamental concept in vector calculus and has significant applications in fields like electromagnetism and fluid dynamics.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction and r is the radial distance from the origin.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the integral:\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV\nwhere V is the volume of a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates yields:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * fᵣ)/∂r\nSince the radial component fᵣ is 1/r², this becomes:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nCalculating the divergence this way suggests it is zero everywhere. However, this is not valid at the origin (r=0) where the field is singular (undefined). This singularity at the origin is crucial. Due to this singularity, the divergence of the field is more accurately represented by a Dirac delta function at the origin, specifically 4πδ³(**r**). Integrating this over the volume of the sphere gives 4π.\n\nA more direct way to solve this without dealing with the delta function is to apply the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface S that encloses V:\n\n∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**A**)\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   The vector field on the surface of the sphere (where r=R) is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n*   The differential surface area element on the sphere is d**A** = **r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ, which always points radially outward.\n\nThe dot product **f** ⋅ d**A** is:\n((1/R²) **r̂**) ⋅ (**r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ)\n\nSince **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the expression simplifies to:\n(1/R²) * R² sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nNow, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere, with θ ranging from 0 to π and φ from 0 to 2π:\n∫₀²ᵖ ∫₀ᵖ sin(θ) dθ dφ\nThe integral of sin(θ) from 0 to π is [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π, which equals (-(-1) - (-1)) = 2.\nThe integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is [φ] from 0 to 2π, which equals 2π.\n\nMultiplying the results gives:\n2 * 2π = 4π.\n\nThis result is consistent regardless of the radius R of the sphere, as long as it encloses the origin. This principle is fundamental to Gauss's Law in electrostatics, where the electric field of a point charge also follows a 1/r² law.\n\nTherefore, the volume integral of the divergence of the given field is 4π.\n\n<<<C>>>"
