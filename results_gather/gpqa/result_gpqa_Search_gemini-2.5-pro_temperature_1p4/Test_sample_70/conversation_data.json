    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Equilibrium Temperature**: The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star, with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a), which is the semi-major axis for an elliptical orbit. Since the planets have circular orbits, 'a' is simply the orbital radius. The relationship is:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Relate Temperature and Orbital Period**: We can use Kepler's Third Law to connect the orbital distance (a) to the orbital period (P). The law states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³). This can be rewritten to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    *   a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combine the Relationships**: By substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship, we can find the direct relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio**: Now we can set up the ratio for the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Use the Given Period Ratios**: The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we can determine the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
