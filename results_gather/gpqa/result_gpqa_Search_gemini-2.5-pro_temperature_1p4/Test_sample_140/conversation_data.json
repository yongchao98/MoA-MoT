    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The identity and number of final products depend on the possible intermediates formed and the subsequent nucleophilic attack.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of Deuteron:** The amide ion can remove the deuterium (D) from carbon-2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from carbon-1, forming an unlabeled benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of Hydrogen:** Alternatively, the amide ion can remove the hydrogen (H) from carbon-6. Elimination of the bromide ion from carbon-1 results in a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. This intermediate remains deuterated at the C2 position (3-deutero-benzyne).\n    *   Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. Therefore, Path B is the major pathway, but both reactions occur.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking either carbon atom of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield the final aniline products.\n    *   **Product from Path A:** The benzyne formed is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Attack by the amide at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n    *   **Products from Path B:** The 3-deutero-benzyne intermediate is asymmetrical.\n        *   If the amide ion attacks C1, the resulting product after protonation is **aniline-2-d** (o-deuteroaniline).\n        *   If the amide ion attacks C6, the resulting product is **aniline-3-d** (m-deuteroaniline).\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three distinct organic products: aniline, aniline-2-d, and aniline-3-d.\n\nThere are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
