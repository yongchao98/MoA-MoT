    "The correct relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars is derived using the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in various energy levels in a system under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N₂) to the number of atoms in a ground state (N₁) is given by the Boltzmann equation.\n    *   (N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n    *   Where:\n        *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n        *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n        *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n        *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write this equation for each star, where T₁ and T₂ are their respective temperatures. Since we are considering the same energy levels for the iron atoms in both stars, the terms `g₂`, `g₁`, and `ΔE` are the same for both.\n    *   For Star 1: (N₂ / N₁)₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)\n    *   For Star 2: (N₂ / N₁)₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that the iron atoms in Star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in Star 2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state in Star 1 is double that of Star 2.\n    *   (N₂ / N₁)₁ = 2 * (N₂ / N₁)₂\n\n4.  **Setting up the Equation**: By substituting the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from the previous step, we get:\n    *   (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂) ]\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Equation**: The statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out on both sides.\n    *   exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n6.  **Solving for Temperature**: To solve for the relationship between T₁ and T₂, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    *   ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₁)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n    *   -ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n    *   -ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - ΔE / kT₂\n\n7.  **Rearranging the Terms**: We isolate ln(2) by rearranging the equation:\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (1/T₂) - (1/T₁) ]\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n8.  **Using the Given Physical Constants**: The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is a fundamental physical constant with the value k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Thus, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n    *   ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n    *   ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
