    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI is a classic method for generating a highly reactive diene, in this case, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This is analogous to the formation of o-xylylene from o-bis(dibromomethyl)benzene.\n*   The newly formed diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, then acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.\n*   Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of the reactive diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This results in the formation of a large, complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid.\n*   **Reaction:** Aqueous acid is used to cleave tert-butyl ethers. The tert-butoxy group (-OC(CH₃)₃) on the C7 bridge of the starting material is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2** is therefore the same complex polycyclic structure as Product 1, but with a hydroxyl group at the C7 position instead of a tert-butoxy group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation. This is a mild method to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively.\n*   Product 2 contains a secondary alcohol at the C7 position, which is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3** is the corresponding ketone, with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C7 bridge position.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C. This temperature is sufficient to induce a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This type of fragmentation is entropically favored as one large molecule breaks into several smaller ones.\n*   The double retro-Diels-Alder reaction reverses the initial cycloaddition, releasing two molecules of the diene (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) and the central core, which would be bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n*   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable and readily extrudes a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic compound, benzene.\n*   The final products of this fragmentation are therefore benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for \"final product 4\". Given the options, it refers to the organic diene product.\n*   **Product 4** is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene), we must analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at positions 5 and 6. The chemical formula is C₈H₈.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule's most stable conformation possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. This axis passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds. The molecule is chiral due to this C₂ symmetry.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    *   The C₂ axis makes the hydrogen on C1 equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (Signal 1)\n    *   The C₂ axis also makes the hydrogen on C2 equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (Signal 2)\n    *   On each of the exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂), the two hydrogens are diastereotopic because of the molecule's chirality. This means they are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   However, the C₂ axis makes the \"outer\" hydrogen of one methylene group equivalent to the \"outer\" hydrogen of the other. (Signal 3)\n    *   Similarly, the \"inner\" hydrogen of one methylene group is equivalent to the \"inner\" hydrogen of the other. (Signal 4)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **four** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
