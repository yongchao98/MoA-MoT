    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n1.  **Define the initial variables and relationships.**\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars, `plx` be the parallax, and `r` be the distance.\n    *   The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`.\n    *   The fundamental relationship between distance `r` and parallax `plx` is inverse: `plx = 1/r`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.**\n    *   The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as...\" can be ambiguous. It could refer to the cumulative number of stars or the number of stars per unit of parallax (a distribution function).\n    *   In physics and astronomy, when discussing how a quantity \"varies with\" a continuous variable, it typically refers to the density or distribution function. For example, \"star counts\" often refer to the number of stars per interval of magnitude or, in this case, parallax.\n    *   Therefore, the most physically sound interpretation is that the number of stars per unit parallax interval (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **State the goal of the problem.**\n    *   The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is explicitly asking for the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to relate the two distributions.**\n    *   We want to find `dN/dr` and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate them using the chain rule of calculus:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.**\n    *   Starting with the relationship `plx = 1/r`, we differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   Since we are interested in the number of stars, which must be positive, we consider the magnitude of this change:\n        `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relationships to find dN/dr.**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule equation:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²) `\n    *   Next, substitute the relationship `plx = 1/r` into this proportionality:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance varies in proportion to the cube of the distance (`r³`). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
