    "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism in a chemistry lab that refers to a failed or poor separation of a mixture of compounds. This problem is particularly descriptive of chromatography techniques.\n\nIn techniques like Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography, compounds are separated based on their differential interactions with a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This separation is primarily driven by the polarity of the compounds.\n\n*   **Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC):** Chemists use TLC to quickly check the progress of a reaction or the purity of a sample. The mixed compounds are \"spotted\" on a plate, which is then placed in a solvent. As the solvent moves up the plate, it carries the compounds with it. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at nearly the same rate, resulting in their spots overlapping or being \"on top of each other.\" This makes it difficult to distinguish between them.\n\n*   **Column Chromatography:** This technique is used to physically separate and purify larger amounts of compounds. The principle is the same as TLC. If compounds have similar polarities, they will travel through the column at similar speeds and exit (or elute) at the same time. This is known as co-elution, where two or more compounds are not resolved and are collected in the same fraction, making the purification unsuccessful.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n*   While van der Waals interactions (A) influence polarity, polarity itself is the direct property that governs this type of separation.\n*   Similar boiling points (C) are a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is a much better visual description for the overlapping spots seen in chromatography.\n*   Optical rotation (D) is a physical property used for characterization, not typically for separation, so it is not relevant to the chemist's problem.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the similar polarities of their compounds, which has led to a poor separation via chromatography.\n\n<<<B>>>"
