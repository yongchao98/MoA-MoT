    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Components**\nThe problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   Number of protons (Z) = 3\n*   Number of neutrons (N) = 3\nThe nucleus is therefore Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\nThe rest energy is given by Einstein's equation E₀ = m₀c², where m₀ is the rest mass of the nucleus. The most accurate way to find the rest mass is to use the experimentally measured mass of the ⁶Li nucleus, which accounts for the nuclear binding energy.\n\nHowever, in many physics problems, a simplified approach is used where the mass of the nucleus is taken as the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, ignoring the binding energy. Let's perform the calculation using both methods.\n\n*   **Method A: Accurate Calculation (including binding energy)**\n    The mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus is 6.0134771 atomic mass units (u).\n    The energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit is 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c².\n    Therefore, the rest energy E₀ is:\n    E₀ = 6.0134771 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 5601.6 MeV\n\n*   **Method B: Simplified Calculation (ignoring binding energy)**\n    This method sums the rest masses of the individual protons and neutrons.\n    *   Rest mass of a proton ≈ 938.27 MeV/c².\n    *   Rest mass of a neutron ≈ 939.57 MeV/c².\n    The combined rest energy E₀ is:\n    E₀ = (3 * 938.27 MeV) + (3 * 939.57 MeV) = 2814.81 MeV + 2818.71 MeV = 5633.52 MeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe nucleus is traveling at a speed (v) of 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor γ is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √(0.0784)\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy (E = γE₀).\n\n*   **Using Method A (Accurate):**\n    E = 3.5714 * 5601.6 MeV ≈ 20005.7 MeV\n    E ≈ 20.006 GeV\n\n*   **Using Method B (Simplified):**\n    E = 3.5714 * 5633.52 MeV ≈ 20119.7 MeV\n    E ≈ 20.120 GeV\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Accurate method: 20.006 GeV\n*   Simplified method: 20.120 GeV\n\nThe given options are:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe result from the simplified calculation (20.120 GeV) is extremely close to option B (20.132 GeV). The small difference is likely due to using slightly different rounded values for the masses of the proton and neutron when the problem was created. The physically more accurate calculation gives a result that is not as close to any of the options. Therefore, it is most probable that the question intended for the simplified calculation method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
