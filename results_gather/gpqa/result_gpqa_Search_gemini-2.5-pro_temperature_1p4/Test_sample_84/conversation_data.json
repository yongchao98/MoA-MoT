    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n-   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n-   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n-   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n-   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that the star's properties (T_star, R_star) are the same for both planets and that the planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and v_p is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is:\n\nv_p ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / (K * sqrt(M_star))) * sqrt(G)\na ≈ G/M_star * (M_p / K)²\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can now find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = [G/M_star * (M_p2 / K2)²] / [G/M_star * (M_p1 / K1)²]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)² / (M_p1 / K1)²\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Given Values\n\nThe problem provides the following:\n-   Planet1 mass (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n-   Planet2 mass (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n-   Planet1 induced Doppler shift (Δλ1) = 0.03 Å\n-   Planet2 induced Doppler shift (Δλ2) = 0.04 Å\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ). Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n\n-   Ratio of masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n-   Ratio of radial velocity amplitudes: K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio\n\nFinally, we use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
