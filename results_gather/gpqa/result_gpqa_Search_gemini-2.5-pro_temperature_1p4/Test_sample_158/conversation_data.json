    "To determine the comoving distance to the quasar, we must first identify the spectral feature mentioned and calculate the quasar's redshift. The observation describes a peak at an observed wavelength (λ_obs) of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. The drop in flux is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, a phenomenon known as the Lyman-alpha forest.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of the Lyman-alpha transition of hydrogen is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1215.67 Å).\n\nFirst, we calculate the redshift (z) using the formula:\n\n*   *1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest*\n*   *1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm*\n*   *1 + z ≈ 6.497*\n*   *z ≈ 5.497*\n\nWith the redshift established, we can now calculate the comoving distance. The problem provides the cosmological parameters for a flat Lambda-CDM model:\n\n*   **Hubble constant (H₀)**: 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter density parameter (Ω_m)**: 0.3\n*   **Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ)**: 0.7\n*   **Curvature (Ω_k)**: 0 (since the universe is flat)\n\nThe comoving distance (D_c) is calculated by integrating over redshift. For a flat universe, the formula is:\n\nD_c = (c/H₀) * ∫ [from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt( Ω_m * (1+z')³ + Ω_Λ )\n\nUsing a cosmological calculator with these parameters (z ≈ 5.497, H₀=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance is found to be approximately **8988 Mpc**.\n\nConverting this to Gigaparsecs (Gpc):\n\n*   8988 Mpc ≈ 8.988 Gpc\n\nThis value is very close to 9 Gpc. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7 Gpc\nB) 9 Gpc\nC) 8 Gpc\nD) 6 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of approximately 9 Gpc matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
