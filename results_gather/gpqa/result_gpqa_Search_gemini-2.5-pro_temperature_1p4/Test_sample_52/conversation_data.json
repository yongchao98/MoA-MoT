    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring & two aromatic-H signals:** The presence of only two signals in the aromatic region for a di-substituted benzene ring strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. This arrangement results in two groups of chemically equivalent protons, often appearing as two doublets. This core structure is a C₆H₄ group.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) & one –CH₃ signal:** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three methyl protons (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, giving a doublet. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **A second –CH₃ signal:** There is one remaining methyl group signal to account for.\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This is a crucial constraint, as it eliminates possibilities like ethyl or propyl groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Absorption peaks indicating an ester group:** The presence of an ester (–COO–) confirms the molecule contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (C₃H₅).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the ester group and the second methyl group. Given the \"no –CH₂ groups\" rule, there are two primary possibilities for this substituent:\n        1.  A methyl ester group: –COOCH₃\n        2.  An acetate group attached via its oxygen: –O–CO–CH₃\n    *   Both of these ester-containing fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Let's add the atoms from the component parts:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 2 (from the C₂H₃O₂ ester fragment) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the C₂H₃O₂ ester fragment) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Both plausible structures, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate and 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate, fit this formula.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This would require two additional hydrogens. This could be achieved by changing the propenyl group (C₃H₅) to a propyl group (C₃H₇). However, both n-propyl (–CH₂CH₂CH₃) and isopropyl (–CH(CH₃)₂) groups are inconsistent with the NMR data (n-propyl has CH₂ signals, and isopropyl would not give vinyl signals).\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** Adding a carbon without changing the hydrogen count relative to C₁₁H₁₂O₂ would require an additional degree of unsaturation. It is difficult to construct a plausible structure with this formula that matches the specific NMR signals.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** To get this formula from C₁₁H₁₂O₂, one would need to add a CH₂ group. A structure like ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate has this formula but is explicitly ruled out by the absence of –CH₂ signals in the NMR spectrum.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectral data, the only formula that is consistent with all the given information is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
