    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution, a two-step calculation is required. First, the concentration of hydrogen ions [H⁺] in the buffer system is calculated, and then this value is used to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion.\n\n**1. Initial Concentrations of Buffer Components**\n\nThe solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄), which provides the acidic component H₂PO₄⁻, and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O), which provides the basic component HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L. The initial concentrations are:\n\n*   **[H₂PO₄⁻]** = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **[HPO₄²⁻]** = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**2. pH and [H⁺] Calculation**\n\nThe primary equilibrium in this buffer solution is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium constant is Ka₂.\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻      (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n\nThe hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] can be calculated using the formula derived from the Ka₂ expression:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ × ( [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] )\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) × ( 0.03674 M / 0.02809 M )\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.116x10⁻⁸ M\n\n**3. Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Calculation**\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻      (Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n\nThe expression for Ka₃ is:\n\nKa₃ = ( [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] ) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻].\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ × ( [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺] )\n\nUsing the previously calculated values for [H⁺] and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (which is a valid approximation due to the very small value of Ka₃):\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) × ( 0.02809 M / 8.116x10⁻⁸ M )\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option C. Minor discrepancies can arise from rounding or slight variations in the constants used.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
