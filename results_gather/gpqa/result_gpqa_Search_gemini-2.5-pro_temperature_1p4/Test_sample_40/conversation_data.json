    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. This is necessary because the speeds involved are comparable to the speed of light, and classical (Galilean) velocity addition would give an incorrect result. The scenario is analogous to the famous Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and was crucial for the development of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and velocities.**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame of reference (let's call it S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving frame of reference (let's call it S').\n    *   The observer is in the laboratory frame S.\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame S') is `u'`.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of light in the glass (in its own rest frame).**\n    The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c` is equal to 1, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.**\n    The formula to add two velocities, `u'` and `v`, that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c²)`\n\n    Here, `u` is the velocity of the light relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1² )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    *   First, simplify the denominator: `1 + v/n`.\n    *   The expression becomes: `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`.\n    *   To eliminate the fractions within the expression, find a common denominator for both the numerator and the denominator. Multiply the top and bottom by `n`:\n        `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n        `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the expression given in option C. Max von Laue demonstrated in 1907 that this result is a natural consequence of Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
