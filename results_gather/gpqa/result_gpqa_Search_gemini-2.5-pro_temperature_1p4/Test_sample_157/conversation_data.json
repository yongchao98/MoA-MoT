    "A dominant-negative mutation produces an altered protein that not only is non-functional itself but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele. In the case of a protein that must form a dimer to be active, a dominant-negative mutant is often one that can still dimerize with the wild-type protein but renders the resulting heterodimer inactive. This \"poisoning\" of the wild-type subunit effectively leads to a loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\nLet's analyze the options in the context of mutation Y in the dimerization domain:\n\n*   **A) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** The mutant Y subunit dimerizes with the wild-type subunit, creating a non-functional or unstable complex. This interference explicitly causes a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\". This faulty dimer may be recognized by cellular quality control machinery and targeted for degradation. This option accurately describes a very plausible molecular mechanism for a dominant-negative effect.\n\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While the mutation causes a loss-of-function phenotype, aggregation (the clumping of many protein molecules) is a specific outcome that is not the defining feature of a dominant-negative mutation. The primary mechanism is the formation of non-functional dimers, not necessarily large aggregates.\n\n*   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** If the mutation prevented dimerization altogether, the mutant protein could not interact with the wild-type protein. The wild-type subunits would be free to form functional homodimers, and the phenotype would likely be wild-type (or at least, the mutation would be recessive, not dominant-negative). This contradicts the definition of a dominant-negative mutation.\n\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** The problem states that Y is a dominant-*negative* mutation, which is a class of loss-of-function mutation. A gain-of-function phenotype is the opposite of what is described.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is the interference with the wild-type protein, leading to its loss of function, potentially accompanied by the degradation of the non-functional complex.\n\n<<<A>>>"
