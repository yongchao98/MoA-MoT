    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms in different energy states under conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n-   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n-   `E₂` and `E₁` are the energies of the levels.\n-   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n-   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Relevant Temperatures\n\nThe problem provides two key temperatures:\n*   The effective temperature of the star without spots: **T_nospot = 6000 K**.\n*   The overall effective temperature when 40% of the surface is covered by spots: **T_withspot = 5500 K**.\n\nAstronomical observations of an unresolved star (where spots are not seen individually) measure the integrated light from the entire stellar disk. The resulting spectrum is characterized by this overall effective temperature. Therefore, the observed change in the spectral line ratios corresponds to the change between these two effective temperatures. The information regarding the 40% spot coverage is extraneous for this specific question.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy Difference of the Transition\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels (ΔE = E₂ - E₁) can be calculated from the given transition wavelength (λ) using the Planck-Einstein relation.\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n-   `h` is Planck's constant (4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s).\n-   `c` is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n-   `λ` is the wavelength, 1448 Å (or 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nΔE = (4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 8.57 eV\n\n### 4. Calculating the Factor of Change\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the population ratios at the two different temperatures. Let R_nospot be the ratio at 6000 K and R_withspot be the ratio at 5500 K.\n\nFactor = R_nospot / R_withspot\n\nFactor = { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)] } / { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_withspot)] }\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out, and the expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1 / T_nospot - 1 / T_withspot) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_withspot - 1 / T_nospot) ]\n\nNow, we substitute the values:\n\n-   ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV\n-   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n-   T_nospot = 6000 K\n-   T_withspot = 5500 K\n\nFirst, calculate the term ΔE / k:\n\nΔE / k ≈ 8.57 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99455 K\n\nNow, calculate the temperature term:\n\n(1/5500 K - 1/6000 K) = (12 - 11) / 66000 K = 1 / 66000 K\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\n\nFactor = exp[ 99455 K * (1 / 66000 K) ]\nFactor = exp(1.507)\nFactor ≈ 4.51\n\nThe ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in the two specified energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when it does.\n\n<<<B>>>"
