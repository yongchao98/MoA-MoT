    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle with mass *m* in the given potential, we first need to express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nWe use the standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\n`x = r cos(θ)`\n`y = r sin(θ)`\n`r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential equation:\nThe first term is `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`.\nThe second term is `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) = 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 kx^2`.\n\nNow, we combine the terms to get the potential in Cartesian coordinates `V(x, y)`:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis potential describes a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\n`V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`\nwhere:\n`V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2`\n`V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThe energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω`, where `ω = sqrt(k_eff/m)` with `k_eff` being the effective spring constant. Because the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies in the x and y directions (`E = E_x + E_y`).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\nThe angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy is `E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\nThe spring constant is `k_y = k`.\nThe angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy is `E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of `E_x` and `E_y`:\n`E = E_x + E_y = (2n_x + 1)ℏ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nHere, `n_x` and `n_y` are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and can take any non-negative integer value (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
