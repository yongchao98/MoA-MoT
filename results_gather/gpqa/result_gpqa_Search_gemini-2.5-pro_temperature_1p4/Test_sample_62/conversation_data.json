    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the initial and final energy states of the diatomic molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n**1. Molecular Model and Energy Levels**\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a specific state (v, J) is given by:\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n**2. Initial and Final States**\nThe molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the quantum numbers v=0 and J=0.\n\nThe question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This implies a rovibrational transition, which is a simultaneous change in both vibrational and rotational energy. According to quantum mechanical selection rules for a diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, the quantum numbers must change as follows: Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), a transition to J=-1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition is to the state where v=1 and J=1.\n\n*   **Initial State (v=0, J=0):** E_i = (0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final State (v=1, J=1):** E_f = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**3. Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (E_photon) equals the difference between the final and initial states (ΔE).\nΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\n**4. Calculation of Molecular Parameters**\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (μ) of the molecule XY.\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\n*   1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\nμ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\nNext, we calculate the moment of inertia (I).\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\nI = μ * R² = (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI = 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\nThen, we find the rotational constant (B).\n*   ħ = 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\nB = ħ² / (2I) = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB ≈ 4.604 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**5. Total Photon Energy**\nNow we can calculate the total energy of the photon using the given angular frequency (ω).\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\nΔE = ħω + 2B\nΔE = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) + 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J)\nΔE = (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.00092 x 10⁻²⁰ J)\nΔE ≈ 4.2192 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**6. Photon Momentum**\nFinally, we calculate the photon's momentum (p) using the energy-momentum relation for a photon.\n*   p = E / c\n*   c = 2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s\np = (4.2192 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
