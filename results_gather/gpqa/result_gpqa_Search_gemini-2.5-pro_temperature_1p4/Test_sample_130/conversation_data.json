    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Anhydride**: A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   The single ¹H NMR peak indicates that all protons in the molecule are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons (protons on a C=C double bond) that are part of a conjugated and electron-deficient system.\n    *   The two ¹³C NMR peaks suggest two different types of carbon atoms. The peak at ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in an anhydride, and the peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   These spectral data are perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). Due to symmetry, its two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a single ¹H NMR signal. It has two equivalent carbonyl carbons and two equivalent alkene carbons, giving two signals in the ¹³C NMR.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction**: The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition where the cyclopentadiene derivative acts as the diene and maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile.\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry**: The Diels-Alder reaction typically yields a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The reaction can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3, which is the sum of the reactants (Maleic anhydride: C4H2O3; Diene: C9H14). This confirms it is an addition reaction.\n    *   ***Endo* product**: This is generally the major product under kinetic control because of favorable secondary orbital interactions during the transition state. In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the double bond of the bicyclic system.\n    *   ***Exo* product**: This is typically the minor product but is thermodynamically more stable due to less steric hindrance. In this isomer, the anhydride ring points away from the double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Signals and NOESY Correlation**: The question describes a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum of the major product that is absent in the minor product. NOESY cross-peaks indicate that two protons are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We must identify a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major product) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor product).\n\n    *   **Proton Assignments in the Product**:\n        *   `H_anhydride`: The two protons originating from maleic anhydride. They are equivalent and appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. They are attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyls.\n        *   `Me_bridge`: The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. Expected as a **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   `Me_vinyl`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. Expected as a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   `H_bridge`: The two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (C7). They would appear as two separate signals, each a doublet due to geminal coupling. The *anti*-proton (pointing away from the double bond, towards the anhydride in the *endo* case) is typically more shielded (upfield shift) than the *syn*-proton. The signal described as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** corresponds to the shielded `H_bridge_anti`.\n\n    *   **NOE Analysis in the *Endo* (Major) Isomer**: In the *endo* structure, the anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, \"under\" the rest of the molecule. This brings the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the `H_bridge_anti` proton (~1.5 ppm), which points down from the C7 bridge. Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n    *   **NOE Analysis in the *Exo* (Minor) Isomer**: In the *exo* structure, the anhydride ring is on the *exo* face, pointing away. The `H_anhydride` protons are now far from the `H_bridge_anti` proton. Thus, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: The observation of a strong cross-peak in the major product and its absence in the minor product uniquely corresponds to the spatial interaction between the anhydride protons and the anti-bridge proton.\n\n*   **Matching with Options**: The cross-peak connects the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`H_anhydride`) and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (`H_bridge_anti`). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
