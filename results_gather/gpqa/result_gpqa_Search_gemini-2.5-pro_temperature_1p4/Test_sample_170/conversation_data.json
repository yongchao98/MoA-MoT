    "To determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Analysis of Substituents\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The substituents on the benzene ring determine the position of the incoming electrophile (Br+) and the reaction rate.\n\n1.  **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves. Generally, the para product is favored over the ortho product due to reduced steric hindrance, especially with larger substituents.\n    *   **-CH₃ (Methyl)** and **-C₂H₅ (Ethyl)**: These are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). Increased steric hindrance from a larger group disfavors substitution at the ortho position, thereby increasing the proportion of the para isomer. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1).\n    *   **-Cl (Chloro)**: This is a deactivating but ortho, para-directing group. The strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect of chlorine deactivates the ring, but its lone pairs can stabilize the intermediate carbocation through resonance, particularly for ortho and para attacks. Data from nitration reactions, which follow similar principles, show that chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para product, often around 70%. This high para selectivity is due to a combination of steric hindrance and the strong inductive deactivation at the closer ortho positions. Comparing typical product ratios, chlorobenzene generally yields a higher fraction of para-isomer than both toluene and ethylbenzene under many conditions.\n\n2.  **Meta-Directing Groups**: These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. The formation of ortho and para isomers is significantly disfavored and occurs in very small amounts. The strength of deactivation correlates with how strongly the group withdraws electrons, making ortho and para positions even less favorable.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro)**: A very strong deactivating group. It yields almost exclusively the meta product, meaning the fraction of para-isomer is extremely low.\n    *   **-COOH (Carboxyl)**: A strong deactivating group.\n    *   **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl Ester)**: Also a strong deactivating group, comparable to -COOH.\n\n### Establishing the Order\n\nWe will arrange the substances in order of *increasing* yield of the para-isomer.\n\n1.  **Lowest Para Yield**: The meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. Among them, the stronger the deactivating effect, the lower the para yield will be.\n    *   The deactivating strength generally follows the order: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n    *   Therefore, nitrobenzene (4) will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n    *   Benzoic acid (6) is more strongly deactivating than ethyl benzoate (2), so it will produce less para-isomer than the ester. For instance, data for nitration shows ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-isomer.\n    *   Thus, the order for the meta-directors is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n2.  **Highest Para Yield**: The ortho, para-directing groups will produce significantly more para-isomer.\n    *   As established, the ethyl group in ethylbenzene (5) is bulkier than the methyl group in toluene (1), leading to a higher para/ortho ratio for ethylbenzene. Typical para yields for toluene bromination are around 30-40%, while for ethylbenzene, it is higher. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   Chlorobenzene (3) is known to give a very high proportion of the para-isomer, often higher than simple alkylbenzenes. For example, nitration of chlorobenzene can yield 64-70% para-product. This suggests that chlorobenzene will have the highest fraction of para-isomer among the o,p-directors given. So, the order is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Arrangement\n\nCombining the two groups, the meta-directors will have lower para yields than the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order within meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order within ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final sequence of increasing para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
