    "### Analysis of the Options:\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory encounters problems with the self-energy of point charges, where the energy of the electric field of an idealized point charge becomes infinite. This is a problem at short distances (high energies) that necessitates a form of regularization or re-evaluation of the point-particle concept.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory, QCD requires regularization to handle ultraviolet (UV) divergences that appear in calculations involving loop diagrams. Perturbation theory in QCD is only applicable at high energies, and non-perturbative methods like lattice QCD are needed for low-energy properties, which inherently use the lattice spacing as a regulator.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is a cornerstone of quantum field theory and was one of the first theories where the need for regularization and subsequent renormalization to handle UV divergences in loop calculations became apparent. Various regularization schemes, like dimensional regularization, are standard tools in QED computations.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** A key feature and motivation for Superstring Theory is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet (UV) divergences. By replacing point-like particles with one-dimensional strings, the theory \"smears out\" interactions, avoiding the short-distance singularities that plague quantum field theories. While the theory may have other types of divergences (infrared), it is widely considered to not require regularization at high energies, making it a \"UV complete\" theory.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the only one among the choices that is thought to not require regularization for high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences.\n\n<<<D>>>"
