    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product from the NMR Data:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 is highly characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically from a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The signals in the aromatic region (δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d)) are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) correspond to two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. One is likely attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the other is part of the ketone structure. The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) suggest a disubstituted vinyl group (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The structure that fits all these signals is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one (also known as p-methylbenzalacetone). The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O).\n    *   **Reagent:** 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) is a non-nucleophilic organic base.\n    *   **Conditions:** High temperature (403 K) in a nonpolar solvent.\n    *   **Transformation:** The reaction is an isomerization (rearrangement), as the molecular formula of the starting material and product are the same. The conversion of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone under basic conditions is a known transformation called the Meinwald rearrangement. DABCO facilitates this rearrangement by deprotonating the terminal carbon of the epoxide ring.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound X by Deducing the Precursor:**\n    *   The product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   This product would be formed from the rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide precursor.\n    *   The structure of the precursor must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The base (DABCO) removes a proton from the CH₂ group of the oxirane ring, leading to ring-opening and formation of the unsaturated ketone.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This would rearrange to 4-phenyl-3-methylbut-3-en-2-one. The NMR for this product (a phenyl group instead of a p-tolyl group) would not match the given spectra.\n    *   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This would rearrange to 1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one. The NMR for this product (an ethyl ketone) would not match the given spectra.\n    *   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O) is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and would rearrange under the given conditions to form 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, whose calculated NMR spectra match the experimental data provided.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
