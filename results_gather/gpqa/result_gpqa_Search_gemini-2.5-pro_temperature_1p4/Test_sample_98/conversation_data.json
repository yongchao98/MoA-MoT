    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, where the peak is significantly broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThis information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the candidates.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of hydrogen atoms attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four candidate molecules are saturated, consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The identification relies on matching the complex splitting patterns to one of the structures.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is magnetically coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving a doublet, n=1), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet, n=2), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving a quartet, n=3).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving a doublet, n=1), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet, n=2), and another different group of two equivalent protons (giving another triplet, n=2).\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of the Candidates\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each candidate to see if its protons could produce the observed splitting patterns. We will assume the condensed formulas represent a continuous chain unless brackets indicate a branch.\n\n*   **A) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\n    The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3 (doublet) and the two `CH₂` protons of the ethyl group at C2 (triplet). This would result in a doublet of triplets (`dt`), which is not what is observed.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3 (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group at C2 (quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (`dq`). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **C) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n    The protons in the `CH₂` group at C2 are adjacent to the chiral center at C3, making them diastereotopic. Each would be split by the other (a doublet) and by the proton at C3 (a doublet), resulting in a doublet of doublets (`dd`). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\n    Let's draw this structure and number the main carbon chain:\n    <pre>\n          Et(A)     Et(B)\n          |         |\n    HOOC¹-CH₂²-CH³-CH⁴-CH₃⁵\n    </pre>\n    This molecule has two chiral centers (C3 and C4). Let's analyze the signals for the protons on the main chain:\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (H4) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group at C2 -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (Et_A) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (H3) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C4 (Et_B) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group at C5 -> gives a **quartet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe proton NMR splitting patterns described in the problem, a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq), are perfectly explained by the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid. This corresponds to the formula given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
