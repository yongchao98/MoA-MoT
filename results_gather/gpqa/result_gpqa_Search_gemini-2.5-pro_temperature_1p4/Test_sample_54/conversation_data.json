    "Based on the provided 1H NMR data and chemical principles, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Here is a detailed breakdown of the spectral data and how it corresponds to the structure:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the three equivalent protons of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). Since there are no adjacent protons, the signal is a singlet. This is consistent with all four possible acetate compounds.\n\n*   **Vinyl Protons (Signals at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm):** These signals fall within the typical range for vinylic protons, which are protons attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This downfield signal corresponds to the vinylic proton attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons in a *trans* configuration are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, while those for *cis* protons are smaller, generally between 6-15 Hz. The large J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This signal represents the second vinylic proton. It appears as a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm). It is further split into a quartet because it is coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the double bond. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion from the Data:**\nThe combination of a *trans* double bond (indicated by J = 16.0 Hz) and a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-) directly points to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate** is ruled out by the large coupling constant.\n*   **Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate** are incorrect because the data clearly shows a methyl group (1.6 ppm, doublet) coupled to a vinylic proton, which is characteristic of a propenyl group, not a butenyl group which would have a different alkyl chain and thus a different NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
