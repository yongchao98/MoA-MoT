    "Here is the selection of the major products for the two rearrangements:\n\n### Reaction A: `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+) ----> A`\n\nThis reaction is a-Wittig rearrangement. The starting material is prenyl benzyl ether, `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-O-CH2-Ph`. The strong base, n-butyllithium (BuLi), deprotonates the most acidic position, which is the benzylic carbon (the one between the phenyl ring and the ether oxygen). This creates a carbanion intermediate.\n\nThis intermediate then undergoes a concerted-sigmatropic rearrangement. In this process, a new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the benzylic carbon and the terminal carbon of the prenyl group's double bond. This rearrangement results in a homoallylic alkoxide, which is then protonated by the acid workup (H+) to yield the final alcohol product.\n\nWhile a direct application of the mechanism to the named starting material would suggest the formation of 2,2-dimethyl-1-phenylpent-4-en-1-ol, this is not an option. However, the rearrangement of the isomeric ether, benzyl (1,1-dimethylallyl) ether, leads to **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**. This product contains a thermodynamically more stable tri-substituted double bond, compared to the mono-substituted double bond in the alternative. It's plausible that under the strong basic conditions, an equilibration occurs that favors the pathway to the more stable product. Given the provided choices, this is the most chemically reasonable product for a Wittig rearrangement.\n\nThe structure of product A is therefore **4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**.\n\n### Reaction B: `3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat ---> B`\n\nThis reaction is a thermal rearrangement of a complex polycyclic hydrocarbon. The presence of a 1,5-diene system, indicated by the `1,11-dimethylene` groups (`=CH2`), and the application of heat strongly suggest a Cope rearrangement. The Cope rearrangement is a-sigmatropic reaction that interconverts 1,5-dienes.\n\nA key characteristic of the Cope rearrangement is that it is a concerted pericyclic reaction which does not change the overall number of atoms or the degree of saturation of the molecule. The starting material is described as a `hexahydro-` derivative, meaning it contains six hydrogens more than its fully aromatic parent ring system. Since the rearrangement only reorganizes the existing bonds without any addition or elimination of atoms, the product must also be a `hexahydro-` derivative.\n\nComparing the options for product B:\n*   One product is a `tetrahydro-` derivative, implying a loss of two hydrogen atoms.\n*   The other product is a `hexahydro-` derivative, implying no change in the degree of saturation.\n\nTherefore, the major product of this Cope rearrangement must be **2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results for both reactions:\n*   **A** = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol\n*   **B** = 2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzoazuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene\n\nThis corresponds to option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
