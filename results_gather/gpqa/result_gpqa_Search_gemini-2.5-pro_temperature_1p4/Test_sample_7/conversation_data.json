    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Gene G2\n\nThe most striking result is from the `g2` knockout mutant, which shows 0% resistance to anthracnose. This means the loss of the G2 gene product completely eliminates the plant's resistance. Furthermore, the double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance.\n\n*   When a mutation in one gene (in this case, `g2`) masks the effect of mutations in other genes (`g1` and `g3`), this is known as **epistasis**.\n*   Because the phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant is the same as the `g2` single mutant, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n*   Similarly, because the `g2g3` double mutant phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant, G2 is also epistatic to G3.\n*   A gene that is epistatic to others and has the most severe loss-of-function phenotype is often an upstream regulator in a genetic pathway. Given that at least one gene is a transcription factor, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role as its function is essential for the entire resistance pathway.\n\n### Analysis of Genes G1 and G3\n\nThe single mutants `g1` and `g3` show a partial loss of resistance (75% and 50% of control, respectively). This indicates that both G1 and G3 contribute to the overall resistance phenotype.\n\n*   The double mutant `g1g3` shows a resistance level of only 10%. This phenotype is much more severe than either of the single mutants and is also more severe than a simple additive effect of the individual mutations (a 25% loss from g1 and a 50% loss from g3 would not predict a 90% total loss).\n*   This pattern, where the loss of two genes together has a much larger effect than the loss of either one alone, is characteristic of **gene redundancy**. It suggests that G1 and G3 have overlapping or parallel functions in the resistance pathway. When only one is absent, the other can partially compensate, but when both are absent, the function is almost completely lost. This type of interaction, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects, is also known as synergistic epistasis.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor due to its epistatic nature and severe phenotype. It also correctly identifies the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy due to the synergistic effect seen in the double mutant. The final claim that \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is not supported by a classical definition, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g1` phenotype (75%), but the first two conclusions are very strong.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The term pleiotropy, where one gene affects multiple traits, is not the correct description for the interaction between G1 and G3 in this context.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** It is impossible to conclude that G1 and G3 share a promoter from this type of phenotypic data. The claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is incorrect.\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** G2, not G1, is the most likely candidate for the transcription factor. The use of \"pleiotropy\" is also incorrect here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, option A provides the most accurate description of the gene interactions. The conclusions that G2 is a transcription factor and that G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy are strongly supported by the data. Despite the questionable assertion about epistasis between G1 and G3, option A is the best overall fit compared to the clear inaccuracies in the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
