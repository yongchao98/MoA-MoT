    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, this relationship is given by:\n\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\n    Where 'a' is the semi-major axis (the orbital distance). This means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n    From this relationship, we can establish a ratio between the orbital distances of two planets based on their equilibrium temperatures:\n\n    (T_i / T_j) = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2)\n\n    By squaring both sides, we can find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\n    (a_j / a_i) = (T_i / T_j)²\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances:**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\n    Using the formula from step 1, we can find the ratio of the orbital distances for Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n\n    And for Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n\n    a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\n    To find the total ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1, we multiply these two ratios:\n\n    a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a):\n\n    P² ∝ a³\n\n    From this, we can derive the relationship for the orbital period:\n\n    P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n    To find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1, we use the following ratio:\n\n    P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:**\n    Using the value of a₃ / a₁ calculated in step 2:\n\n    P₃ / P₁ ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)\n    P₃ / P₁ ≈ (10.3684)^1.5\n    P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.38\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information regarding the planet masses, the TTV discovery method, and the specific albedo value (as it is the same for all planets) is not needed for this calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 33.4\nB) ~ 4.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nThe calculated factor of ~33.4 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
