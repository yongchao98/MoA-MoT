    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Determine the rest masses of the fragments**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `M*c² = 300 GeV`. Therefore, the initial mass is `M = 300 GeV/c²`.\n*   Let the rest masses of the two fragments be `m₁` and `m₂`. We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate `m₁` as the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substituting `m₁ = 2 * m₂` into the sum equation: `2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can now find `m₂`: `m₂ = 0.33 * M = 0.33 * (300 GeV/c²) = 99 GeV/c²`.\n*   And `m₁`: `m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (99 GeV/c²) = 198 GeV/c²`.\n*   In terms of energy, the rest-mass energies of the fragments are `m₁c² = 198 GeV` and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\n*   According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after.\n*   Initial energy `E_initial = M*c² = 300 GeV` (since the nucleus is at rest).\n*   Final energy `E_final = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`, where T₁ and T₂ are the kinetic energies of the fragments.\n*   The total kinetic energy `Q` is `T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`.\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply conservation of momentum**\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `|p₁| = |p₂|`.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation**\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p₁² = p₂²`, so `2*m₁*T₁_classical = 2*m₂*T₂_classical`, which simplifies to `m₁*T₁_classical = m₂*T₂_classical`.\n*   This gives the ratio `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n*   We also know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical` into the sum: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy and momentum is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   Total energy `E` is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = mc² + T`.\n*   Substituting this into the energy-momentum relation: `(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   Expanding and rearranging gives the formula for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2*T*mc²`.\n*   Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, we have `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   Therefore: `T₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂c²)`.\n*   We know `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV` (so `T₂ = 3 - T₁`), `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   Substituting these values: `T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)`.\n*   `T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)`.\n*   Simplifying the equation by canceling `T₁²` from both sides: `396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁`.\n*   `600*T₁ = 603`.\n*   `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the difference**\n\n*   The difference is `ΔT₁ = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n*   `ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To convert this to MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   `ΔT₁ = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ value and the classically calculated T₁ value is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
