    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown white solid.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak**: The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak**: There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 with about one-third (32%) the intensity of the M+ peak. This M+ and M+2 pattern in an approximate 3:1 ratio is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹)**: This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹)**: This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this is assigned to the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion**: The IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)**: A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration (1H) confirms one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**: These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, as are the two protons ortho to the other substituent, leading to this simplified pattern.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate**: This molecule lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad O-H stretch in the IR or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**: This molecule fits all the data. Its molecular weight is 156.5 g/mol, and it contains one chlorine atom. It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data. As a para-substituted benzene ring, its ¹H NMR spectrum would show two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the carboxylic acid proton, which is consistent with the observed spectrum.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**: While this is a chlorobenzoic acid, its ortho-substitution pattern would produce a much more complex set of four different signals for the aromatic protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**: This structure contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have a proton at 11.0 ppm and would show a different aromatic splitting pattern.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe combined spectral evidence—a molecular weight of 156 with one chlorine atom, the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
