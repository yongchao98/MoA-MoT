    "To determine the correct option, we must identify two compounds based on their isomeric properties.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism that involves the migration of a proton (typically a hydrogen atom) and a shift in the location of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the most common form, a molecule must possess an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule features a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The carbon atoms of the carbonyl groups are bonded to other carbons within the ring that are part of C=C double bonds. These adjacent carbons have no hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens and cannot exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound consists of a six-carbon ring with three ketone groups. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are each bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, which can move to a nearby oxygen atom. This allows the compound to undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is a highly stable aromatic compound.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of a chiral molecule is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and an ester group (-COOCH3). Because this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of optical isomers (enantiomers).\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of an unsaturated diester. Due to the double bond, there is no free rotation, which leads to geometric isomerism (*cis* and *trans*). However, the molecule itself is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
