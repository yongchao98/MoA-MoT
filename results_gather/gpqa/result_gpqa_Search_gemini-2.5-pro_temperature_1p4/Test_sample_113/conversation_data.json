    "Based on the principles of organic chemistry, the suitable reagents for the reactions are determined as follows:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. It involves the nucleophilic attack of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which must be protonated to yield the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product. An acid source is required for this protonation step. H₃O⁺ represents the acidic conditions or acidic workup needed to supply the proton. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is typically carried out under harsh conditions, requiring either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst, along with heat. Of the given options, HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid commonly used for this purpose, while CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and generally ineffective for nitrile hydrolysis. Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<D>>>"
