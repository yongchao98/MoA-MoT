    "The search results confirm the method for calculating the pH of a mixture of acids and bases. The general procedure is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of all acidic (H+) and basic (OH-) species.\n2.  Allow the strong acid and strong base to neutralize each other first.\n3.  Determine which, if any, is in excess.\n4.  If there is an excess of strong acid or strong base, it will then react with the weak acid or weak base.\n5.  After all neutralization reactions are complete, identify the major species remaining in the solution.\n6.  If excess strong base remains, the pH is determined by the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions. The contribution from the conjugate base of the weak acid is generally negligible.\n7.  The final concentration is calculated by dividing the moles of the excess species by the total volume of the solution.\n\nMy initial step-by-step calculation followed this exact procedure.\n\n1.  **Moles Calculation:**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid) = 0.500 L * 0.1 M = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid) = 0.400 L * 0.2 M = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base) = 2 * (0.300 L * 0.3 M) = 0.180 mol\n\n2.  **Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   OH- is in excess.\n    *   Remaining OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n3.  **Weak Acid-Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   The remaining strong base (OH-) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   OH- is still in excess.\n    *   Remaining OH- = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n4.  **Final Solution Composition & pH Calculation:**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.050 mol of excess OH- in a total volume of 1.200 L.\n    *   Final [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the established chemical principles found in the search results. I am confident in my answer.\n\nTo determine the pH of the final solution, we must perform a stoichiometric analysis of the neutralization reactions that occur when the three solutions are mixed.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acid and base.**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH - a weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Volume × Molarity\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl - a strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = Volume × Molarity\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol H⁺\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2 - a strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely, providing two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Volume × Molarity = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻\n\n**2. Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe first reaction is between the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n*   The hydroxide ions are in excess. The H⁺ ions will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol OH⁻\n\n**3. Neutralize the weak acid with the remaining strong base.**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol\n*   The hydroxide ions are still in excess. The weak acid will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol OH⁻\n\n**4. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH⁻). Therefore, the pH will be determined by the concentration of these excess hydroxide ions.\n\n*   **Total Volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
