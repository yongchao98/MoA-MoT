    "To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we use the formula for the standard deviation of an operator in a given quantum state:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$. The expectation value is calculated by the formula $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\nGiven the matrices:\nThe operator $P_z$ is:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system $|\\psi\\rangle$ is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe conjugate transpose of the state, $\\langle\\psi|$, is:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, let's calculate $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z | \\psi \\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\nNow, we must find the expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\nFirst, let's find the matrix for $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n<<<A>>>"
