    "Here is a breakdown of the proposed experiments:\n\n*   **A) Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant:** The firefly luciferase enzyme uses ATP to produce light in the presence of its substrate, luciferin. Measuring the light output is a direct and widely used method to quantify cellular ATP levels. Since mitochondria are the primary producers of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, a change in mitochondrial function will directly impact cellular ATP, which this assay would detect. Thus, this is a valid experiment.\n\n*   **B) Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells:** \"Mito-RTP\" is a fluorescent probe that selectively localizes in mitochondria to measure temperature. Mitochondrial temperature is closely linked to its metabolic activity and energy production. Therefore, using this specialized stain with confocal microscopy to observe changes in mitochondrial temperature would be a valid way to investigate the drug's effect on mitochondrial function.\n\n*   **D) Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide:** This chemical is commonly known as JC-1. JC-1 is a cationic dye widely used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, a key indicator of mitochondrial health. In healthy mitochondria with a high membrane potential, JC-1 forms aggregates that fluoresce red/orange. In unhealthy mitochondria with a low membrane potential, the dye remains as monomers and fluoresces green. Using flow cytometry to measure the ratio of red to green fluorescence is a standard, quantitative method to assess drug effects on mitochondrial function.\n\n*   **C) Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit:** This experiment has a fundamental flaw. The first step correctly isolates mitochondria. However, the second step applies a glucose uptake assay to this isolated fraction. Glucose uptake is the process of transporting glucose across the *cell's plasma membrane*, which is accomplished by glucose transporter proteins (GLUTs). Mitochondria do not take up glucose; their primary fuel inputs are molecules like pyruvate (the end-product of glycolysis in the cytoplasm), fatty acids, and ketone bodies. Therefore, measuring \"glucose uptake\" in an isolated mitochondrial sample is biochemically irrelevant and will not provide any meaningful information about the drug's effect on mitochondrial function. The assay is designed to be used on whole cells.\n\n<<<C>>>"
