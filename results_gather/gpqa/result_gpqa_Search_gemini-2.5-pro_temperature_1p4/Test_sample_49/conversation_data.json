    "The most reliable indicator of the number of loops in a Feynman diagram calculation is the power of the `1/(4π)` factor that arises from loop integrals.\n\nIn a calculation in four-dimensional spacetime using dimensional regularization, each loop integral contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression. This comes from integrating over an undetermined four-momentum for each loop. The general formula relates the number of loops, L, to the power of the `1/(4π)` term as `(1/(4π))^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key part of this expression for determining the number of loops is `1/(4π)^6`. By comparing this to the general formula, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for L gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops. The other terms in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3`, `g^2`), numerical factors (`sqrt(2)`, `8`), and the ratio of energy scales (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to the specific particles, interactions, and kinematics of the particular theory, but the `1/(4π)^6` factor is a general feature of a 3-loop calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
