    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the nitration of toluene. The use of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid, particularly with heating, leads to exhaustive nitration, producing 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Product 1 is therefore TNT.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group (-CH3) of TNT. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in an acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent that converts benzylic carbons to carboxylic acids. Thus, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is oxidized to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid (TNBA). Product 2 is 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis step involves two sequential reactions:\n*   **Decarboxylation:** 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid, when heated or in the presence of a base, readily undergoes decarboxylation (loss of CO2) to form 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB). The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the three nitro groups facilitates this reaction.\n*   **Meisenheimer Complex Formation:** The resulting 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is a highly electron-deficient aromatic ring. In the presence of sodium hydroxide, acetone forms an enolate anion (-CH2COCH3). This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the TNB ring in a reaction known as the Janovsky reaction, forming a stable anionic σ-complex called a Meisenheimer complex. Product 3 is the Meisenheimer adduct of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene and the acetone enolate.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nThe structure of Product 3 is the [1-(acetonyl)-2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienyl] anion. The acetone enolate adds to one of the carbon atoms of the benzene ring, which becomes sp3 hybridized, breaking the aromaticity. The other five carbons remain sp2 hybridized, and the negative charge is delocalized over the ring and the nitro groups.\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule:\n*   The molecule has a C1-C4 axis where C1 is bonded to the acetonyl group (-CH2COCH3) and a hydrogen, and C4 is bonded to a nitro group and a hydrogen.\n*   A plane of symmetry (σ) can pass through the C1-C4 axis. This plane contains the acetonyl group and the nitro group at C4.\n*   This plane reflects the nitro group at C2 onto the identical nitro group at C6.\n*   It also reflects the hydrogen at C3 onto the hydrogen at C5.\n*   For this plane to be a true symmetry element, the acetonyl group itself must be symmetric with respect to this plane. By orienting the C-C=O backbone of the side chain within this plane, this condition can be met.\n*   There are no rotational axes (other than C1) or a center of inversion.\n\nA molecule that possesses only an identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
