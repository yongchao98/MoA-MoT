    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the expectation value.\n\n### 1. Define the State and Operators\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn the standard basis, where |↑⟩ is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]` and |↓⟩ is represented by `[0, 1]`, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:\n\n|ψ⟩ = `[ 0.5 ]`\n     `[ √3/2 ]`\n\nThe operator for which we need to find the expectation value is:\nÔ = 10σz + 5σx\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are given by:\nσz = `[ 1  0 ]`\n     `[ 0 -1 ]`\n\nσx = `[ 0  1 ]`\n     `[ 1  0 ]`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of an operator Ô is calculated as ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩. We can use the linearity of expectation values to calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately.\n\n⟨Ô⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n\n**a) Calculate the expectation value of σz (⟨σz⟩):**\n\nThe expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩.\n\nFirst, apply the σz operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσz|ψ⟩ = `[ 1  0 ] [ 0.5 ]` = `[  0.5  ]`\n        `[ 0 -1 ] [ √3/2 ]`   `[ -√3/2 ]`\n\nNext, take the inner product with the bra vector ⟨ψ|, which is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ| = `[ 0.5  √3/2 ]`\n\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = `[ 0.5  √3/2 ] [  0.5  ]` = (0.5)(0.5) + (√3/2)(-√3/2)\n                                 `[ -√3/2 ]`\n\n⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = **-0.5**\n\n**b) Calculate the expectation value of σx (⟨σx⟩):**\n\nThe expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.\n\nFirst, apply the σx operator to the state |ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = `[ 0  1 ] [ 0.5 ]` = `[ √3/2 ]`\n        `[ 1  0 ] [ √3/2 ]`   `[  0.5  ]`\n\nNext, take the inner product with the bra vector ⟨ψ|:\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = `[ 0.5  √3/2 ] [ √3/2 ]` = (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5)\n                                 `[  0.5  ]`\n\n⟨σx⟩ = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = **√3/2**\n\n**c) Combine the results:**\n\nNow, substitute the expectation values of σz and σx back into the equation for ⟨Ô⟩:\n⟨Ô⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n⟨Ô⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)\n⟨Ô⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨Ô⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨Ô⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨Ô⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is **-0.7**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
