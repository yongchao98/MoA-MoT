The key to solving the problem lies in recognizing one specific property of this distribution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle: The \"Memoryless\" Property**\n    The most crucial concept to grasp is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless** process. This means that the probability of an atom decaying in any future time interval is completely independent of its past history. An atom does not \"age\" or become \"due\" for decay. Therefore, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant to its future behavior. This simplifies the question significantly. We can rephrase it as: *What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?*\n\n2.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom has not decayed (it survives) by time `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a value unique to the type of atom.\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can directly find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is a key parameter that we can use to solve the problem without explicitly finding the decay constant `λ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability for the New Time Interval**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can use the value found in the previous step and the properties of exponents to find `S(150)`:\n    `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, we substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Answer**\n    Let's calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    The probability of decay within 150 minutes is therefore:\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options and Conclude**\n    The calculated probability is `0.43926`, which is equivalent to `43.926%`. We compare this to the provided options:\n    A) 44%\n    B) 40%\n    C) 48%\n    D) 52%\n\n    The value `43.926%` is closest to **44%**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Key:** The most common mistake in problems like this is incorrectly thinking that the atom is \"more likely\" to decay because time has passed. This must be ignored.\n*   **Work with Survival Probability:** It's often easier to work with the survival probability `S(t) = e^(-λt)` as an intermediate step, as shown in the calculation `S(150) = S(100)^1.5`.\n*   **Clerical Errors:** The provided candidate answers show near-unanimous agreement on the physics and calculation, but differ in their final letter choice. This is due to different ordering of the options in their prompts. The calculation `1 - (0.68)^1.5` consistently yields ~43.9%, which matches the value `44%` from the list.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Principle:** Every candidate answer correctly identifies the most crucial concept: **radioactive decay is a memoryless process**. This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution that models this phenomenon.\n    *   **Implication:** The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The atom does not \"age\".\n    *   **Simplification:** Therefore, the question simplifies from \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" to the much simpler question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\".\n\n2.  **Establish the Mathematical Model:** The candidates correctly use the standard formula for exponential decay.\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* for a time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter:** All candidates correctly use the provided data point to find a solvable parameter without needing to calculate `λ` explicitly.\n    *   Given: The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   Using the formula: `1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`.\n    *   This implies that the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`. This value is the key to the next step.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Desired Probability:** The goal is to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   All solutions correctly use the properties of exponents to relate `S(150)` to the known `S(100)`:\n        `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   Substituting the value from Step 3: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** This is the final numerical step, which is also agreed upon by all candidates.\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n        `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    *   Next, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes:\n        `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`.\n    *   Expressed as a percentage, this is **43.93%**.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\n\nThe step-by-step reasoning and calculation are unanimously agreed upon across all candidate answers. The calculated probability is ~43.93%. We must now compare this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 44%\n*   B) 48%\n*   C) 40%\n*   D) 52%\n\nThe calculated value of 43.93% is closest to **44%**.

The problem is equivalent to finding the decay probability for a new atom over a 150-minute period.\n2.  **Probability Formulation:** The probability of decay `P(t)` is `1 - e^(-λt)`.\n3.  **Using Given Data:** From `P(100) = 0.32`, we deduce that the survival probability for 100 minutes, `S(100) = e^(-100λ)`, is `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n4.  **Calculating the Target Probability:** We need `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.

This is a fundamental characteristic of the exponential distribution that models this phenomenon. It means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is therefore irrelevant to the calculation of its future decay probability. The atom does not \"age\". The question simplifies from a conditional probability to a direct one: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a duration `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom decays within a duration `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes:\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value is a key parameter we can use to solve the problem without needing to find the decay constant `λ` itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can use the value we found in Step 3 and the properties of exponents to find `e^(-150λ)`:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    Now we can calculate the final probability `P(150)`.

The code execution serves to confirm the numerical calculation.\n\n1.  **Recap of Logic**: The core idea is that radioactive decay is memoryless, so the 50 minutes that have passed are irrelevant. We need to calculate the probability of a fresh atom decaying in 150 minutes, `P(150)`. We are given `P(100) = 0.32`.\n\n2.  **Survival Probability**: From `P(100) = 0.32`, we deduce that the survival probability for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Survival for 150 mins**: The survival probability for 150 minutes is `S(150) = S(100)^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5`. The Python code was executed to calculate this value.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Code Output**: The `Code output` confirms the calculation:\n    *   `S(150) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n\n5.  **Final Decay Probability**: The probability we are looking for is the decay probability, which is `P(150) = 1 - S(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Converting the probability to a percentage gives `43.926%`.

The unanimous agreement among the agents on the methodology highlights the correct path to the solution. Let's consolidate this into a clear, step-by-step decision process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle: The Memoryless Property**\n    As correctly identified by every single candidate answer, radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The key feature of this distribution is that it is **\"memoryless.\"** This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it \"older\" or any more (or less) likely to decay. Therefore, the information about the first 50 minutes is extraneous and should be disregarded for calculating the future probability.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**\n    Based on the memoryless property, the question:\n    *\"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"*\n    simplifies to the much more direct question:\n    *\"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"*\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom *decays* within a time interval `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for the specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom *surviving* past time `t` is:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can deduce the survival probability for 100 minutes, which is a key parameter for the rest of the problem:\n    `P_survival(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This allows us to solve the problem without needing to find the value of `λ` itself.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can use the value found in Step 4 by using the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the value for `e^(-100λ)`:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    Now we can calculate the final probability:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    `P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n7.  **Compare to Options and Final Decision**\n    The calculated probability is `0.43926`, which is equivalent to **43.926%**. We must now compare this to the original options provided in the prompt:\n    *   A) 48%\n    *   B) 52%\n    *   C) 44%\n    *   D) 40%\n\n    The value `43.926%` is unequivocally closest to `44%`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals a strong consensus on the physical principle and the mathematical calculation. All roads lead to a probability of approximately 43.9%. This rounds to 44%, which corresponds to option C in the original question's list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the provided candidate answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle: The Memoryless Property**\n    All candidate answers unanimously and correctly identify the most critical concept for solving this problem: radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution that models this phenomenon.\n    *   **What this means:** The probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. An atom does not \"age,\" and its chance of decaying does not change over time.\n    *   **A careful point:** The information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is extraneous and must be disregarded. The problem is not about a conditional probability related to the first 50 minutes; it is equivalent to asking a simpler question.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**\n    Based on the memoryless property, the problem is simplified to: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\" All agents correctly make this simplification.\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**\n    The decay process is modeled by the following equations, which all agents correctly utilize:\n    *   The probability of an atom *surviving* for a duration `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n    *   The probability of an atom *decaying* within a duration `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n    Here, `λ` is the decay constant, a specific value for this type of atom.\n\n4.  **Utilize the Given Experimental Data**\n    The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). This information is used to find a key parameter.\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can calculate the survival probability for 100 minutes, a step every agent performed correctly:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   **A careful point:** It is not necessary to explicitly solve for `λ`.

The problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom has not decayed (survives) by a time `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    Where `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant for this specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed within a time `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can express this using our formula:\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes, which will be a more useful value for the next step:\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    We now have a key parameter `e^(-100λ) = 0.68` without needing to calculate `λ` itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability for the New Time Interval**\n    We need to find the probability of the atom decaying within the next 150 minutes. Based on the memoryless property, this is simply `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can calculate `e^(-150λ)` by using our known value and the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Answer and Select the Closest Option**\n    First, we calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`, which is the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n\n    The probability of decay is therefore:\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n    Converting this probability to a percentage gives `43.926%`. We now compare this to the given options:\n    A) 48%\n    B) 52%\n    C) 40%\n    D) 44%\n\n    The calculated value of `43.926%` is clearly closest to **44%**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Memoryless Property:** Recognizing this is key. The 50 minutes of history are irrelevant.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay:** The initial information is about decay probability `P(t)`, but the calculation is simpler if you convert it to survival probability `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n*   **Exponent Rules:** The calculation `e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5` is the correct mathematical shortcut.\n*   **Approximation:** The final result is not an exact integer percentage, so choosing the *closest* option is necessary.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem describes the radioactive decay of a single atom. The most fundamental concept governing this process is that it is **memoryless**. This is a key feature of the exponential distribution that models radioactive decay.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The \"memoryless\" property means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay as time passes. Therefore, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is extraneous and should be disregarded for calculating future probabilities.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**: Based on the memoryless principle, the complex conditional question simplifies to a direct one: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**: The probability of a radioactive atom *decaying* within a time `t`, denoted as `P(t)`, is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant specific to the atom. The probability of the atom *surviving* past time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   **Careful Point**: This value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is the crucial parameter we can use. There is no need to solve for the decay constant `λ` itself, which simplifies the calculation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, which, as we established, is equivalent to `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can express the term `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in the previous step and the laws of exponents:\n    *   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, we substitute the value from Step 4:\n    *   `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Numerical Calculation**: We substitute this result back into the formula for `P(150)`:\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    I will use a simple Python script to get a precise value for this calculation.\n    ```python\n    probability = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n    print(probability)\n    ```\n    The calculated probability is approximately `0.43926`, or `43.926%`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options and Conclude**: The calculated probability is `43.926%`.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nThe candidate answers show a strong consensus on this exact reasoning and calculation, even though there is confusion in mapping the final result to the correct letter in some cases (likely due to shuffled options in their prompts). The underlying physics and mathematics are sound and point to one answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem, consolidating the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem describes radioactive decay. The single most important concept governing this process is that it is **\"memoryless\"**. This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution which models radioactive decay. The \"memoryless\" property means that the probability of an event (like an atom decaying) occurring in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. In this case, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it any more or less likely to decay in the future. The atom does not \"age\".\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**: Because the process is memoryless, we can ignore the condition that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed.\" The problem simplifies to a more direct question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model**: The probability of a radioactive atom surviving for a duration `t` is given by the survival function, `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. Consequently, the probability of the atom decaying within a duration `t` is given by `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**: We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can directly find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value is a key parameter we can use to solve the rest of the problem without needing to explicitly find the value of the decay constant `λ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of the atom decaying within a 150-minute interval. As established in Step 2, this is simply `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can relate the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150)`, to the survival probability for 100 minutes, `S(100)`, using the properties of exponents:\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, we substitute the value we found in Step 4:\n    *   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: The final probability of decay is `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`. Let's calculate this value.\n    ```python\n    probability_of_decay = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n    print(f\"The probability of decay is {probability_of_decay:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"As a percentage, this is {probability_of_decay * 100:.2f}%\")\n    ```\n    The calculation yields a survival probability for 150 minutes of `S(150) ≈ 0.5607`.\n    The decay probability is therefore:\n    `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**: The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is `43.93%`.

This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution that models this phenomenon.\n*   **What this means:** The probability that the atom will decay in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history.\n*   **Application:** The information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant for calculating the future probability. It does not make the atom \"older\" or more likely to decay. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Model\nThe probability of radioactive decay is described by the following equations:\n*   The probability that an atom **survives** (does not decay) for a time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n*   The probability that an atom **decays** within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\nHere, `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value unique to this type of atom.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter\nWe are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can derive the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is the essential parameter we need. It allows us to solve the problem without explicitly calculating the value of `λ`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability\nWe need to find the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes.

The 50 minutes of survival must be ignored.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay:** The calculation proceeds by finding the survival probability for 100 minutes (`0.68`) and using that to find the survival probability for 150 minutes (`0.68^1.5`). The final answer is the decay probability (`1 - 0.68^1.5`). It's important not to mix these two quantities up.\n*   **Exponent Rules:** Correctly applying the rule `x^(a*b) = (x^a)^b` is essential for solving without finding `λ`.\n*   **Option Mapping:** As seen in the candidate answers, there can be confusion in mapping the calculated value to the correct letter if the option list is reordered.

The key to solving the problem lies in recognizing one specific property of this distribution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle: The \"Memoryless\" Property**\n    The most crucial concept to grasp is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless** process. This means that the probability of an atom decaying in any future time interval is completely independent of its past history. An atom does not \"age\" or become \"due\" for decay. Therefore, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant to its future behavior. This simplifies the question significantly. We can rephrase it as: *What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?*\n\n2.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom has not decayed (it survives) by time `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a value unique to the type of atom.\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can directly find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is a key parameter that we can use to solve the problem without explicitly finding the decay constant `λ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability for the New Time Interval**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can use the value found in the previous step and the properties of exponents to find `S(150)`:\n    `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, we substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Answer**\n    Let's calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    The probability of decay within 150 minutes is therefore:\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options and Conclude**\n    The calculated probability is `0.43926`, which is equivalent to `43.926%`. We compare this to the provided options:\n    A) 44%\n    B) 40%\n    C) 48%\n    D) 52%\n\n    The value `43.926%` is closest to **44%**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **The Memoryless Property is Key:** The most common mistake in problems like this is incorrectly thinking that the atom is \"more likely\" to decay because time has passed. This must be ignored.\n*   **Work with Survival Probability:** It's often easier to work with the survival probability `S(t) = e^(-λt)` as an intermediate step, as shown in the calculation `S(150) = S(100)^1.5`.\n*   **Clerical Errors:** The provided candidate answers show near-unanimous agreement on the physics and calculation, but differ in their final letter choice. This is due to different ordering of the options in their prompts.

This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution that models this phenomenon.\n    *   **Implication:** The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The atom does not \"age\".\n    *   **Simplification:** Therefore, the question simplifies from \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" to the much simpler question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\".\n\n2.  **Establish the Mathematical Model:** The candidates correctly use the standard formula for exponential decay.\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* for a time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter:** All candidates correctly use the provided data point to find a solvable parameter without needing to calculate `λ` explicitly.\n    *   Given: The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   Using the formula: `1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`.\n    *   This implies that the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`. This value is the key to the next step.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Desired Probability:** The goal is to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   All solutions correctly use the properties of exponents to relate `S(150)` to the known `S(100)`:\n        `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   Substituting the value from Step 3: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** This is the final numerical step, which is also agreed upon by all candidates.\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n        `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    *   Next, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes:\n        `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`.\n    *   Expressed as a percentage, this is **43.93%**.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Answer Selection\n\nThe step-by-step reasoning and calculation are unanimously agreed upon across all candidate answers.

The question simplifies from a conditional probability to a direct one: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a duration `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom decays within a duration `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes:\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value is a key parameter we can use to solve the problem without needing to find the decay constant `λ` itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes.

The unanimous agreement among the agents on the methodology highlights the correct path to the solution. Let's consolidate this into a clear, step-by-step decision process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle: The Memoryless Property**\n    As correctly identified by every single candidate answer, radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The key feature of this distribution is that it is **\"memoryless.\"** This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it \"older\" or any more (or less) likely to decay. Therefore, the information about the first 50 minutes is extraneous and should be disregarded for calculating the future probability.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**\n    Based on the memoryless property, the question:\n    *\"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"*\n    simplifies to the much more direct question:\n    *\"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"*\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom *decays* within a time interval `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for the specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability of the atom *surviving* past time `t` is:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can deduce the survival probability for 100 minutes, which is a key parameter for the rest of the problem:\n    `P_survival(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This allows us to solve the problem without needing to find the value of `λ` itself.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can use the value found in Step 4 by using the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the value for `e^(-100λ)`:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    Now we can calculate the final probability:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n    `P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n7.  **Compare to Options and Final Decision**\n    The calculated probability is `0.43926`, which is equivalent to **43.926%**.

This is a fundamental characteristic of the exponential distribution that models decay.

The problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    The probability that an atom has not decayed (survives) by a time `t` is given by the survival function:\n    `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    Where `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant for this specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *has* decayed within a time `t` is:\n    `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter**\n    We are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can express this using our formula:\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\n    From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes, which will be a more useful value for the next step:\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    We now have a key parameter `e^(-100λ) = 0.68` without needing to calculate `λ` itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability for the New Time Interval**\n    We need to find the probability of the atom decaying within the next 150 minutes. Based on the memoryless property, this is simply `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\n    We can calculate `e^(-150λ)` by using our known value and the properties of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\n    Now, substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Answer and Select the Closest Option**\n    First, we calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`, which is the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n\n    The probability of decay is therefore:\n    `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\n    Converting this probability to a percentage gives `43.926%`. We now compare this to the given options:\n    A) 48%\n    B) 52%\n    C) 40%\n    D) 44%\n\n    The calculated value of `43.926%` is clearly closest to **44%**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Memoryless Property:** Recognizing this is key. The 50 minutes of history are irrelevant.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay:** The initial information is about decay probability `P(t)`, but the calculation is simpler if you convert it to survival probability `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n*   **Exponent Rules:** The calculation `e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5` is the correct mathematical shortcut.\n*   **Approximation:** The final result is not an exact integer percentage, so choosing the *closest* option is necessary.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem describes the radioactive decay of a single atom. The most fundamental concept governing this process is that it is **memoryless**. This is a key feature of the exponential distribution that models radioactive decay.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The \"memoryless\" property means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay as time passes. Therefore, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is extraneous and should be disregarded for calculating future probabilities.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**: Based on the memoryless principle, the complex conditional question simplifies to a direct one: \"What is the probability that a newly obtained atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Model**: The probability of a radioactive atom *decaying* within a time `t`, denoted as `P(t)`, is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant specific to the atom. The probability of the atom *surviving* past time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can calculate the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   **Careful Point**: This value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is the crucial parameter we can use. There is no need to solve for the decay constant `λ` itself, which simplifies the calculation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, which, as we established, is equivalent to `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can express the term `e^(-150λ)` using the value we found in the previous step and the laws of exponents:\n    *   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, we substitute the value from Step 4:\n    *   `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Numerical Calculation**: We substitute this result back into the formula for `P(150)`:\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    I will use a simple Python script to get a precise value for this calculation.\n    ```python\n    probability = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n    print(probability)\n    ```\n    The calculated probability is approximately `0.43926`, or `43.926%`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options and Conclude**: The calculated probability is `43.926%`. We now compare this with the provided options:\n    A) 40%\n    B) 44%\n    C) 48%\n    D) 52%\n    The value `43.926%` is closest to `44%`. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nThe candidate answers show a strong consensus on this exact reasoning and calculation, even though there is confusion in mapping the final result to the correct letter in some cases (likely due to shuffled options in their prompts). The underlying physics and mathematics are sound and point to one answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem, consolidating the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem describes radioactive decay. The single most important concept governing this process is that it is **\"memoryless\"**. This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution which models radioactive decay. The \"memoryless\" property means that the probability of an event (like an atom decaying) occurring in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. In this case, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it any more or less likely to decay in the future. The atom does not \"age\".\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question**: Because the process is memoryless, we can ignore the condition that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed.\" The problem simplifies to a more direct question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model**: The probability of a radioactive atom surviving for a duration `t` is given by the survival function, `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. Consequently, the probability of the atom decaying within a duration `t` is given by `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter**: We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can directly find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This value is a key parameter we can use to solve the rest of the problem without needing to explicitly find the value of the decay constant `λ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of the atom decaying within a 150-minute interval. As established in Step 2, this is simply `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    We can relate the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150)`, to the survival probability for 100 minutes, `S(100)`, using the properties of exponents:\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, we substitute the value we found in Step 4:\n    *   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**: The final probability of decay is `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`. Let's calculate this value.\n    ```python\n    probability_of_decay = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n    print(f\"The probability of decay is {probability_of_decay:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"As a percentage, this is {probability_of_decay * 100:.2f}%\")\n    ```\n    The calculation yields a survival probability for 150 minutes of `S(150) ≈ 0.5607`.\n    The decay probability is therefore:\n    `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**: The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is `43.93%`. We now compare this result to the given options in the question:\n    A) 44%\n    B) 40%\n    C) 48%\n    D) 52%\nThe calculated value of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to reach the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principle\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the most important concept: radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This is a fundamental property of the exponential distribution that models this phenomenon.\n*   **What this means:** The probability that the atom will decay in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history.\n*   **Application:** The information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is irrelevant for calculating the future probability. It does not make the atom \"older\" or more likely to decay. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Model\nThe probability of radioactive decay is described by the following equations:\n*   The probability that an atom **survives** (does not decay) for a time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n*   The probability that an atom **decays** within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\nHere, `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value unique to this type of atom.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter\nWe are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can derive the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `S(100) = 0.68`, is the essential parameter we need. It allows us to solve the problem without explicitly calculating the value of `λ`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability\nWe need to find the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply `P(150)`.\n*   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n\nWe can use the value found in Step 3 and the properties of exponents to find `e^(-150λ)`:\n*   `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value for `e^(-100λ)`:\n*   `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Final Numerical Calculation\nThe probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nLet's compute the value:\n1.  Calculate `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56074`\n2.  Calculate the final probability: `P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.56074 = 0.43926`\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives `43.926%`.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Options and Select the Final Answer\nThe calculated probability is approximately `43.93%`.

The 50 minutes of survival must be ignored.\n*   **Survival vs. Decay:** The calculation proceeds by finding the survival probability for 100 minutes (`0.68`) and using that to find the survival probability for 150 minutes (`0.68^1.5`). The final answer is the decay probability (`1 - 0.68^1.5`). It's important not to mix these two quantities up.\n*   **Exponent Rules:** Correctly applying the rule `x^(a*b) = (x^a)^b` is essential for solving without finding `λ`.\n*   **Option Mapping:** As seen in the candidate answers, there can be confusion in mapping the calculated value to the correct letter if the option list is reordered.
