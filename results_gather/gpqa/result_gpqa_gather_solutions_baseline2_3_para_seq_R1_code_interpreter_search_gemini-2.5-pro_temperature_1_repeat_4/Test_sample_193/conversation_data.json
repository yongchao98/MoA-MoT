Understand the Goal and the Physics**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the partition function `Z` for a system of three interacting spins (S1, S2, S3), each taking values +1 or -1. The partition function is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics, defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible states of the system.\n\n`Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)` where `β = 1/(kT)`\n\nSince multiple states can share the same energy, a more efficient way to calculate Z is to sum over the distinct energy levels, weighting each term by its degeneracy `g` (the number of states with that energy).\n\n`Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)`\n\n**2. Identify States and Calculate their Energies**\n\nThe system has three spins, each with two possible values, so there are 2³ = 8 total microstates. The energy for each state is given by the Hamiltonian: `E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]`. We can group the states by symmetry to simplify the calculation.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This configuration includes two states: `(+1, +1, +1)` and `(-1, -1, -1)`.\n    *   For the `(+,+,+)` state:\n        `E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J[3] = -3J`\n    *   For the `(-,-,-)` state:\n        `E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[1+1+1] = -3J`\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are **2 states** with an energy level of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is `g₁ = 2`.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is different from the other two.**\n    This configuration includes the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 states. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, `(+1, +1, -1)`:\n    *   For the `(+,+,-)` state:\n        `E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J[1-1-1] = -J[-1] = +J`\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category will have the same energy. These states are:\n        `(+1, +1, -1)`, `(+1, -1, +1)`, `(-1, +1, +1)` (two up, one down)\n        `(-1, -1, +1)`, `(-1, +1, -1)`, `(+1, -1, -1)` (one up, two down)\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**.

Final Decision and Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nThe correctly derived formula for the partition function is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n\nNow, we compare this result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)  (Incorrect energy values)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)  (Incorrect energy values)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)      (Incorrect signs in the exponents)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)      (**This is the correct match**)\n\n**Careful Point**: An analysis of the 15 candidate answers shows that almost all of them performed the physics calculation correctly and arrived at the same formula: `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. The reason for the different final letters (A, B, C, or D) is that each \"agent\" was clearly working from a differently ordered list of options. However, based on the options provided in *this* problem description, the uniquely correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough re-evaluation of the problem, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function.\n\n### **1. Understanding the System and Microstates**\n\nThe system consists of three spins (S₁, S₂, S₃), where each spin can take a value of either +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations, or microstates, for the system is therefore 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Energy for Each Microstate**\n\nThe energy of the system for any given microstate is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃]\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`, over all 8 microstates. To make this calculation manageable, we can group the states by their energy value, a concept known as degeneracy.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This configuration applies to two states: `(+, +, +)` and `(-, -, -)`.\n    *   For the state `(+, +, +)`:\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[3] = **-3J**\n    *   For the state `(-, -, -)`:\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are **2 states** that share an energy level of E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy (g₁) is 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This configuration applies to the remaining 6 states. Due to the symmetry of the energy formula, all these states will have the same energy. Let's calculate for a representative state, `(+, +, -)`:\n    *   For the state `(+, +, -)`:\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   The six states in this group are: `(+,+,-)`, `(+,-,+)`, `(-,+,+)`, `(+,-,-)`, `(-,+,-)`, `(-,-,+)`. All have the same energy.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are **6 states** that share an energy level of E₂ = +J. The degeneracy (g₂) is 6.\n\n*   **Verification:** The sum of the degeneracies is g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which correctly accounts for all possible microstates.\n\n### **3. Constructing the Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe partition function is the sum over the distinct energy levels, where each term is the product of its degeneracy and its Boltzmann factor:\nZ = g₁ * e⁻βE₁ + g₂ * e⁻βE₂\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e⁻β(-3J) + 6 * e⁻β(+J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e⁻Jβ\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nThe derived mathematical expression for the partition function is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. We now compare this result to the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)**\n*   B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated result perfectly matches **Option A**.\n\n**Note on Candidate Answers:** A review of the provided candidate answers shows that almost all of them correctly performed the physical calculation and derived the same formula `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. The disagreement in their final letter choice (e.g., A, B, C, D) stems from being presented with differently ordered lists of options. Based on the options provided in *this* problem description, the correct choice is unambiguously A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Goal**\nThe problem asks for the partition function Z of a system with three spins (S1, S2, S3), each taking values of +1 or -1. The energy is given by E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ]. The partition function is the sum of Boltzmann factors, e^(-βE), over all possible states.\n\n**2. Identify All Microstates and Their Energies**\nThere are 2³ = 8 total possible configurations (microstates) for the three spins. We can simplify the process by grouping states that have the same energy due to symmetry. There are two distinct types of configurations.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    This includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   For the state (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**\n    *   There are **2 states** that share the same energy level, E₁ = -3J. This is the first energy level, and its degeneracy (g₁) is 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This accounts for the remaining 6 states. Let's calculate the energy for one representative state, for example, (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category have the same energy. These states are:\n        -   Two spins up, one down: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n        -   One spin up, two spins down: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n    *   There are **6 states** that share the same energy level, E₂ = +J. This is the second energy level, and its degeneracy (g₂) is 6.\n\n**3. Construct the Partition Function Z**\nThe partition function Z is the sum over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4. Final Verification**\nThe derived mathematical expression for the partition function is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. We now compare this to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nThe derived formula matches option C perfectly.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis:**\n*   All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical formula `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n*   The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidates are due to the fact that they were each presented with a differently ordered list of options.\n*   The core physics calculation is sound and consistently agreed upon: there are two states with energy -3J and six states with energy +J.\n*   Based on the specific option list in this question, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function, considering the provided reasoning from other agents.\n\n### 1.

Identify Unique Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies\nThe core of the problem, as demonstrated by all candidate answers, is to group the 8 microstates by their energy. This avoids calculating the same term multiple times. There are two distinct energy configurations based on spin alignment.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   This occurs in two states: `(+1, +1, +1)` and `(-1, -1, -1)`.\n    *   Let's calculate the energy for `(+1, +1, +1)`:\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[3] = -3J.\n    *   For `(-1, -1, -1)`:\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.\n    *   **Result**: There are **2 states** with an energy level of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is `g₁ = 2`.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This accounts for the remaining `8 - 2 = 6` states. These are the states with either two \"+1\" spins and one \"-1\" spin, or one \"+1\" spin and two \"-1\" spins.\n    *   Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, `(+1, +1, -1)`:\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**.\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category will have the same energy.\n    *   **Result**: There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**. The degeneracy is `g₂ = 6`.\n\n### 3. Construct the Partition Function Z\nThe partition function Z is the sum over the unique energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\n**Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n### 4. Analysis and Final Decision\nThe derived expression for the partition function is **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**.\nThis mathematical result is robust and was derived correctly by nearly every candidate agent, indicating a high degree of confidence in the physics calculation itself.\n\nThe confusion among the agents' final answers (A, B, C, or D) arises from differences in how the multiple-choice options were presented to them. To find the correct answer for *this* question, we must match our derived formula to the specific list of options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)  (Incorrect signs in the exponents)\n*   B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta) (Incorrect energy values; 2J instead of 3J and J)\n*   **C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta) (This exactly matches our derived result)**\n*   D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta) (Incorrect energy values and degeneracies)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Microstates**\n\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can be in one of two states: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down). This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations, or microstates, for the system.\n\n### **2. Define the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible microstates of the system:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nwhere E is the energy of a specific state and β = 1/kT.\n\nWhen multiple states share the same energy, we can simplify this formula by summing over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy (g), which is the number of states at that energy level:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies**\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for all 8 microstates using the given formula: `E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]`. We can group the states by their configuration to simplify the calculation.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\nThis case includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n*   For the state **(+1, +1, +1)**:\n    E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n*   For the state **(-1, -1, -1)**:\n    E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n\nConclusion for Case 1: There are **2 states** with an energy level of **E₁ = -3J**. Therefore, the degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis case accounts for the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 states. By symmetry, all these states will have the same energy. Let's test one representative state, **(+1, +1, -1)**:\n*   E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[ -1 ] = **+J**\nThe six states in this category are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n\nConclusion for Case 2: There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**. Therefore, the degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\nWe have accounted for all 2 + 6 = 8 states.\n\n### **4. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow we assemble the partition function using the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### **5. Match the Result with the Options**\n\nThe derived mathematical expression for the partition function is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. We now compare this with the provided list of options:\n\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur result perfectly matches option **C**.\n\n**Note on Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly performed the physical calculation, arriving at the expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.

The task is to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three interacting spins. Let's break down the problem step by step to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Partition Function\n*   **System**: We have three spins (S1, S2, S3), each can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   **Total Microstates**: The total number of possible configurations is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Energy**: The energy for any given microstate is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n*   **Partition Function (Z)**: Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible microstates.

Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nAll provided candidate answers, despite selecting different final letters (A, B, C, or D), follow the exact same correct physical and mathematical derivation. They all arrive at the identical expression for the partition function. The discrepancy in their final letter choice arises because the multiple-choice options were presented to them in a different, scrambled order. The core reasoning is sound and consistent across all candidates.\n\nThe task is to perform this derivation correctly and map the result to the specific list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`, over all possible states of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\n**Step A: Identify All Microstates and Their Energies**\n\nThe system has 3 spins (S1, S2, S3), each being +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 microstates. The energy of each state is given by E = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃].

The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This configuration applies to the remaining six states. We can calculate the energy for a representative state, e.g., (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   For state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category have the same energy.\n    *   Conclusion: There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**.

Match the Result to the Options**\n\nNow we compare our derived formula, `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`, with the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nThe derived expression is an exact match for **Option D**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Summary**\n\n1.  **State Enumeration**: It's critical to account for all 8 (2³) possible spin configurations.\n2.  **Degeneracy Calculation**: The key is to correctly identify that there are only two unique energy levels: -3J (with 2 states) and +J (with 6 states).\n3.  **Sign Convention**: A common error is mixing up signs. The energy formula starts with -J, and the Boltzmann factor is e^(-βE). For E = -3J, the term becomes e^(-β * -3J) = e^(3Jβ).\n4.  **Matching Terms**: The degeneracy `g=2` must be paired with the energy `E=-3J`, and `g=6` with `E=+J`. The final expression is `2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n\nThe derivation is robust and unambiguously leads to the expression found in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is the comprehensive solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal\nThe problem asks for the partition function, Z, of a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by `E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]`. The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible states.\n\n### Step 2: Enumerate All Possible States and Calculate Their Energies\nThere are 2³ = 8 possible microstates for the three spins. To calculate the partition function, we need to find the energy for each state. A more efficient method is to find the distinct energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states corresponding to each energy level).\n\nLet's evaluate the term `P = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3`. The energy will then be `E = -J * P`.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): `P = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3`. The energy is **E = -3J**.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): `P = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 3`. The energy is **E = -3J**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are **2 states** with an energy of E₁ = -3J. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This includes all the remaining 6 states. Let's test a representative state, for example, (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): `P = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1`. The energy is E = -J * (-1) = **+J**.\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this group have the same energy. These states are:\n        - (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n        - (-1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, -1)\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are **6 states** with an energy of E₂ = +J. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Partition Function Z\nThe partition function Z is the sum over the unique energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe correct mathematical expression for the partition function is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n\n**Careful Point**: All 15 candidate answers correctly derive this same mathematical formula. The discrepancies in their final answers (A, B, C, or D) arise because they were presented with multiple-choice options in different orders. The core physics calculation is unanimously agreed upon.\n\nMy task is to match the correct formula to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n*   A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nComparing the derived result, `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`, with the provided list, it exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct partition function Z for the given system.\n\n### **1. Understand the System and its Microstates**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins (S₁, S₂, S₃).\n*   Each spin can have one of two values: +1 or -1.\n*   Therefore, the total number of possible configurations, or microstates, is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n### **2. Define the Energy and the Partition Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃].\n*   The partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all 8 microstates. A more efficient way to calculate this is to group states with the same energy level:\n    Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n    where g(E) is the degeneracy, i.e., the number of states with a particular energy E.\n\n### **3.

The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This configuration accounts for the remaining 6 microstates. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, for instance (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = **+J**\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category will have the same energy.

The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n### **4. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow, we assemble the partition function using the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### **5. Final Decision and Comparison with Options**\n\nThe correctly derived partition function is **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**.\n\nLet's carefully compare this result with the provided options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated expression perfectly matches option D.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**: A crucial observation is that nearly all candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical formula Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). The disagreement in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is because they were presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options.

Understand the System and Microstates**\n\nThe system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), each of which can be in one of two states: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down). This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations, or microstates, for the system.\n\n### **2. Define the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, over all possible microstates of the system:\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\nwhere E is the energy of a specific state and β = 1/kT.\n\nWhen multiple states share the same energy, we can simplify this formula by summing over the distinct energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy (g), which is the number of states at that energy level:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n### **3. Calculate the Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies**\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for all 8 microstates using the given formula: `E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]`. We can group the states by their configuration to simplify the calculation.\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\nThis case includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n*   For the state **(+1, +1, +1)**:\n    E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n*   For the state **(-1, -1, -1)**:\n    E = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n\nConclusion for Case 1: There are **2 states** with an energy level of **E₁ = -3J**. Therefore, the degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis case accounts for the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 states. By symmetry, all these states will have the same energy. Let's test one representative state, **(+1, +1, -1)**:\n*   E = -J[ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[ -1 ] = **+J**\nThe six states in this category are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n\nConclusion for Case 2: There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**. Therefore, the degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\nWe have accounted for all 2 + 6 = 8 states.\n\n### **4. Construct the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow we assemble the partition function using the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### **5. Match the Result with the Options**\n\nThe derived mathematical expression for the partition function is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. We now compare this with the provided list of options:\n\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur result perfectly matches option **C**.\n\n**Note on Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly performed the physical calculation, arriving at the expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.

Now, we compare this expression to the options provided in the question:\n    *   **A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)**\n    *   B) Z= 2e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    *   C) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    *   D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur result perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nAll provided candidate answers, despite selecting different final letters (A, B, C, or D), follow the exact same correct physical and mathematical derivation. They all arrive at the identical expression for the partition function. The discrepancy in their final letter choice arises because the multiple-choice options were presented to them in a different, scrambled order. The core reasoning is sound and consistent across all candidates.\n\nThe task is to perform this derivation correctly and map the result to the specific list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`, over all possible states of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\n**Step A: Identify All Microstates and Their Energies**\n\nThe system has 3 spins (S1, S2, S3), each being +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 microstates. The energy of each state is given by E = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃].

The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    This configuration applies to the remaining six states. We can calculate the energy for a representative state, e.g., (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   For state (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category have the same energy.\n    *   Conclusion: There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**.

Match the Result to the Options**\n\nNow we compare our derived formula, `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`, with the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   B) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nThe derived expression is an exact match for **Option D**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Summary**\n\n1.  **State Enumeration**: It's critical to account for all 8 (2³) possible spin configurations.\n2.  **Degeneracy Calculation**: The key is to correctly identify that there are only two unique energy levels: -3J (with 2 states) and +J (with 6 states).\n3.  **Sign Convention**: A common error is mixing up signs. The energy formula starts with -J, and the Boltzmann factor is e^(-βE). For E = -3J, the term becomes e^(-β * -3J) = e^(3Jβ).\n4.  **Matching Terms**: The degeneracy `g=2` must be paired with the energy `E=-3J`, and `g=6` with `E=+J`. The final expression is `2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n\nThe derivation is robust and unambiguously leads to the expression found in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is the comprehensive solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal\nThe problem asks for the partition function, Z, of a system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), where each spin can be +1 or -1.

The energy `E` of the system is given by the Hamiltonian `E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]`. The partition function is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`, over all possible states of the system, where `β = 1/(kT)`.\n\n**2. Identifying Microstates and Energy Levels**\nA system of three spins with two possible states each has a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations or microstates. To find the partition function, we must calculate the energy for each of these 8 states.

The degeneracy is `g₁ = 2`.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is different from the other two.** This accounts for the remaining 6 states. These are the states with two spins up and one down, or one spin up and two down. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, for example, (+1, +1, -1).\n    *   For the state (+1, +1, -1): The energy is `E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = +J`.\n    *   By symmetry, all 6 states in this category have the same energy. (These states are: (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,-1), and (-1,-1,+1)).\n    *   **Conclusion**: There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = +J**.
