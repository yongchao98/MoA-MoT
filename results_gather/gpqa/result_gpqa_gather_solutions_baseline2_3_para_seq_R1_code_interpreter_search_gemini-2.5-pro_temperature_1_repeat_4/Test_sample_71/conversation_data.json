The four bromine atoms are removed from the two `-CHBr₂` groups, leading to the formation of two exocyclic double bonds. The product is the highly reactive diene **`5,6-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (also known as isotoluene).\n*   **Cycloaddition:** This generated diene acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. Since two equivalents of the diene are formed and the starting norbornadiene derivative has two double bonds, two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions occur. This results in the formation of a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis (Deprotection)**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group `(-OtBu)` at the C7 position of the central bicyclic core is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group `(-OH)`. The resulting molecule is **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃-pyridine complex in DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation protocol that converts the secondary alcohol (`-OH`) into a ketone (`C=O`). The product is the corresponding ketone, **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and heating a complex adduct like Product 3 favors the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This fragmentation is driven by a large positive change in entropy and the formation of highly stable molecules.\n*   **Fragmentation Products:** Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the regenerated diene: **`5,6-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n*   **Further Decomposition:** The ketone intermediate, `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`, is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### **Identifying \"Final Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final stable organic products of the reaction sequence are benzene and `5,6-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must determine which of these is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of distinct hydrogens with the given options.\n\n1.  **Benzene:** Has a high degree of symmetry (D₆h point group), which makes all six of its hydrogen atoms chemically identical. It has only **1** type of distinct hydrogen. This value is not present in the options.\n2.  **`5,6-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** Since benzene is not an option, this must be \"Product 4\". We must analyze its structure for symmetry to count its distinct hydrogen environments.\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two endocyclic double bonds (C1=C2, C3=C4) and two exocyclic double bonds at C5 and C6.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes several pairs of hydrogen atoms equivalent:\n        *   The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent. (Set 1)\n        *   The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent. (Set 2)\n        *   The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. The two protons within each methylene group are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). Let's call them \"inner\" and \"outer\". The two \"inner\" protons (one on each group) are made equivalent by the C₂ axis. (Set 3)\n        *   Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are made equivalent by the C₂ axis. (Set 4)\n\nThis analysis reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This number corresponds to option D in the provided choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe problem describes a four-step chemical synthesis, and asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product, which requires determining its molecular structure.\n\n1.  **Step 1: In situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   **Reactants:** The reaction begins with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile) and `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` (the diene precursor).\n    *   **Diene Formation:** The most direct chemical interpretation of the reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a double reductive elimination. This reaction generates `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`, a reactive triene.\n    *   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** The generated diene then reacts with the dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene are formed and the dienophile possesses two double bonds, two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions occur. This results in the formation of a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The tert-butoxy group (`-O-tBu`) attached to the bicyclic core is converted into a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation procedure that converts the secondary alcohol at the bridge position into a ketone (a carbonyl group, `C=O`). The resulting molecule is **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Retro-Diels-Alder)**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\n    *   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat. The fragmentation is particularly favorable here as it leads to very stable products.\n    *   **Fragmentation Products:** Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts: two molecules of the initial diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`).\n    *   **Further Reaction:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Analysis of the \"Final Product 4\"\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must identify \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of distinct hydrogens in each to the provided options.\n\n*   **Benzene:** Has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen atom due to its high symmetry. This is not among the choices (7, 10, 8, 4).\n*   **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene:** This must be the intended \"Product 4\". We need to analyze its structure to determine the number of distinct hydrogen environments.\n    *   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic `(=CH₂)` groups at C5 and C6. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** This C₂ symmetry dictates the equivalence of the hydrogen atoms.\n        1.  The proton on C1 is chemically equivalent to the proton on C4. (**Set 1**: 2H total)\n        2.  The proton on C2 is chemically equivalent to the proton on C3. (**Set 2**: 2H total)\n        3.  The two exocyclic `(=CH₂)` groups are equivalent. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). The two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other by the C₂ rotation. (**Set 3**: 2H total)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**: 2H total)\n\nThis analysis shows that there are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would lead to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum. This number matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to identify the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then determine the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms by analyzing its molecular symmetry.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the chemical transformations and key analysis points:\n\n### Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This molecule contains two reactive C=C double bonds within a norbornadiene framework.\n*   **Diene Generation:** The molecule `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is treated with sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature. This is a reductive elimination reaction. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups (located at the C5 and C6 positions of the cyclohexadiene ring) are removed to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   **Reactive Intermediate (Diene):** The diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Cycloaddition:** Since two equivalents of the diene are generated, they react with the two double bonds of the dienophile in two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions. This results in the formation of a large, complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n### Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-O-tBu) group at the C7 position of the central bicyclic core is cleaved and replaced with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **Product 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃-pyridine complex in DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation procedure that converts the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O). The product of this step is **Product 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Thermal Decomposition\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3, a large double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** This is the most critical step. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat (driven by an increase in entropy). Product 3 fragments back into its constituent building blocks.\n    *   **Products of Fragmentation:** The reaction yields two molecules of the original diene, **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**, and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    *   **Further Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Analysis of the Final Product \"4\"\n\nThe final mixture of stable organic products contains benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must check which of the products corresponds to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n1.  **Benzene:** Has only **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen due to its high symmetry. This is not among the options.\n2.  **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** This must be the intended \"Product 4\". We analyze its structure for symmetry.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Equivalent Hydrogens:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons (one on each methylene group) are equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n\nThis analysis reveals that `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` has a total of **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Generation of the Reactive Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction starts with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The NaI acts as a reductant, causing a double dehalogenation of the two `-CHBr₂` groups to form two exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   The highly reactive intermediate generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. This is the key diene for the subsequent reaction.\n*   This diene then reacts with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since the problem specifies two equivalents of the diene precursor and the dienophile has two double bonds, two sequential Diels-Alder reactions occur. This produces a large, complex polycyclic ether, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that cleaves the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` group at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation specific for converting the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction)**\n\n*   Product 3, the large double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. High temperatures favor the reverse of the Diels-Alder reaction, a process known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is the most crucial and chemically sound step to analyze.\n*   The fragmentation breaks Product 3 down into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile, which is now a ketone: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n*   This ketone intermediate is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination reaction, losing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form another highly stable molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Analysis of \"Final Product 4\"**\n\nThe final mixture contains two major stable organic products: benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must identify which of these is the intended \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of their distinct hydrogen atoms to the given options.\n\n1.  **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. Therefore, benzene has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen. This is not among the options (10, 4, 8, 7).\n2.  **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈):** This must be \"Product 4\". To find the number of distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze its symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the middle of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        *   **Set 1:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 2:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 3:** The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). The two protons on each methylene group are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons (one on each group) are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n        *   **Set 4:** Likewise, the two \"outer\" protons (one on each group) are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n\nThis analysis shows that there are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would correspond to four signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThis number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of that product's symmetry to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Generation of the Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction (Formation of Product 1)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Identifying the Reactive Diene):** The starting material `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with sodium iodide (NaI). This is a well-known reductive dehalogenation reaction. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the C5 and C6 carbons of the ring undergo elimination of the four bromine atoms, forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The resulting reactive species is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. This is the most direct and chemically literal interpretation of the problem statement.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (The Cycloaddition):** The problem states that 2 equivalents of this diene precursor are used with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. The dienophile has two reactive double bonds. Therefore, two sequential Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloadditions occur, forming a large, polycyclic adduct, which is **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Identifying the Reaction):** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard protocol for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-OtBu) group at the C7 position of the central bicyclic framework is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Identifying the Reagent):** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This reagent system is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation. It is a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The C7 hydroxyl group is oxidized to a carbonyl (C=O) group, yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Product 4)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5 (Identifying the Thermal Reaction):** Product 3, a complex double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are thermally reversible. The most expected and common pathway at elevated temperatures is a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   **Careful Point 6 (Fragmentation and Subsequent Reactions):** The fragmentation proceeds as follows:\n    1.  Product 3 breaks down into its original building blocks: two molecules of the diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, which is `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    2.  This intermediate, `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`, is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the Final Product and Counting Hydrogens**\n\n*   **Careful Point 7 (Choosing the Correct Product):** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\".\n    *   Benzene (C₆H₆) is highly symmetric and all six hydrogens are equivalent. It has **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This number is not among the options (7, 4, 10, 8).\n    *   Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be the other major organic product: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Careful Point 8 (Symmetry Analysis):** We must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈) to count the non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the centers of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   This symmetry operation creates sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent. (Set 1)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent. (Set 2)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two hydrogens are in different environments (diastereotopic). The C₂ axis relates the two \"inner\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (Set 3)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis relates the two \"outer\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (Set 4)\n    *   This gives a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe calculated number, 4, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, we must first deduce the structure of that product by carefully analyzing each step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. This molecule, a norbornadiene derivative, contains two double bonds that are active in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Diene Generation:** The reaction involves `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The reaction of a gem-dibromide (like -CHBr₂) with NaI is a known method for reductive elimination to form a double bond. In this case, the two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 atoms of the cyclohexadiene ring react to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   **Reactive Diene:** The diene generated *in situ* is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** (also known as isotoluene). This is the most direct and chemically sound interpretation of the given starting material.\n*   **Cycloaddition:** The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used. Thus, two molecules of the generated diene react with the two double bonds of the dienophile in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions. This forms a large, complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Acidic Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an acid-labile tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (`-OtBu`) at the C7 position of the bicyclic core is cleaved and replaced by a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), forming **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation specific for converting alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (carbonyl group, `C=O`), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Final Product 4)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\n*   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat (due to an increase in entropy). This is the most expected fate for a complex Diels-Alder adduct under thermal stress.\n*   **Fragmentation Products:** Product 3 fragments back into its constituent building blocks:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile, which is now a ketone: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Subsequent Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable.

This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n**Step 1: Generation of the Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction starts with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile) and `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` (the diene precursor).\n*   **Diene Generation**: The compound `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is treated with sodium iodide (NaI). This reagent causes a reductive elimination of all four bromine atoms, forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The resulting reactive diene formed *in situ* is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This is the most direct and chemically accurate interpretation of the starting material as named.\n*   **Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**: The dienophile possesses two double bonds. Since two equivalents of the diene are generated, two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions occur. Two molecules of the diene add across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene framework, creating a large, polycyclic molecule, which is **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation**: This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` group (–O*t*Bu) is cleaved and replaced by a hydroxyl group (–OH), yielding **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃·pyridine in DMSO).\n*   **Transformation**: This is a mild oxidation specific for converting alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. The secondary alcohol at the C7 position of the bicyclic core is oxidized to a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Product 4)**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\n*   **Transformation**: Diels-Alder reactions are thermally reversible. At elevated temperatures, the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is highly favorable. This is especially true here, as the decomposition leads to very stable products.\n*   **Fragmentation Products**: Product 3 fragments back into its constituent molecules:\n    1.  Two molecules of the regenerated diene: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile, now in its oxidized ketone form: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Further Decomposition**: The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the exceptionally stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Identifying \"Product 4\" and Counting its Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe stable organic products from the final thermal step are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"Product 4.\" We must compare the properties of the final products to the given options.\n\n*   **Benzene**: Due to its high symmetry, all six of its hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. It has **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This is not among the options (10, 8, 4, 7).\n*   **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**: Since benzene is not an option, \"Product 4\" must be this diene. We now analyze its symmetry to count the number of non-equivalent hydrogens.\n    *   **Structure**: The molecule consists of a six-membered ring containing two internal double bonds (C1=C2, C3=C4) and two exocyclic double bonds at the adjacent positions C5 and C6.\n    *   **Symmetry**: The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 single bonds.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence**: This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. Within each group, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). The two \"inner\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  The two \"outer\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n*   **Conclusion**: There are a total of **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This would correspond to four unique signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThis result, 4, matches option C. The reasoning across the provided candidate answers overwhelmingly supports this chemical pathway and conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction\n*   **Reactants:** `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile) and `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` (the diene precursor).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Transformation:** The most plausible reaction for the precursor with NaI is a reductive elimination of the four bromine atoms to create two new exocyclic double bonds. While the naming in the problem might be slightly non-standard or contain a typo for a more common precursor, the intended reactive intermediate is a diene like `o-xylylene` or one of its isomers. The most direct interpretation of the name provided generates **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** (also known as isotoluene).\n*   **Cycloaddition:** This generated diene reacts with the dienophile in two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions, as two equivalents are used and the dienophile has two double bonds.

The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by the C₂ axis. Within each methylene group, the two protons are in different chemical environments relative to the ring (they are diastereotopic). The C₂ axis makes the two \"inner\" hydrogens (closer to the ring diene) equivalent. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" hydrogens are equivalent.

This step is straightforward and all analyses agree.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation specific for converting the secondary alcohol `(-OH)` into a ketone `(C=O)`.\n*   This transforms the C7 alcohol group into a ketone, resulting in **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Final Product 4)**\n\n*   Product 3, a large Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and at elevated temperatures, the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is strongly favored, especially when it leads to stable products.\n*   **Fragmentation**: Product 3 fragments back into its original constituent parts:\n    1.

This logical pathway is the most chemically sound and is consistently identified in the reasoning of the provided candidate answers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. This molecule has two reactive double bonds, making it suitable for two consecutive Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene Precursor):** `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is treated with sodium iodide (NaI). The most direct and chemically sound interpretation of this reaction is a double reductive dehalogenation. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups at positions C5 and C6 are eliminated, forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   **Generated Diene:** The product of this elimination is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (also known as isotoluene, C₈H₈).\n*   **Cycloaddition:** Two equivalents of this generated diene react with the two double bonds of the dienophile in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions, forming a large polycyclic ether, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n\n*   **Product 1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O). These are standard conditions for cleaving an acid-labile tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-O*t*Bu) group at C7 is hydrolyzed to a `hydroxyl` (-OH) group.\n*   The result is the corresponding alcohol, **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n\n*   **Product 2** is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃·pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation protocol that converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a `ketone` (C=O).\n*   The result is the corresponding ketone, **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n\n*   **Product 3**, a complex Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150 °C. The most expected thermal reaction for such an adduct is the reverse of its formation, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is thermodynamically favored at high temperatures by an increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable products.\n*   The fragmentation of **Product 3** regenerates its constituent molecules:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile, which is now in its oxidized ketone form: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n*   **Further Reaction:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Analysis of the Final Product \"4\"**\n\nThe final stable organic products are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must determine which of these products matches one of the provided options.\n\n*   **Candidate A (Benzene):** Due to its high D₆h symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. It has only **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen. This is not among the options (7, 10, 4, 8).\n*   **Candidate B (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`):** As benzene is not an option, \"Product 4\" must be this molecule. We must now analyze its symmetry to count its distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a `1,3-diene` system (C1=C2-C3=C4) with exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`) at positions C5 and C6.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a **C₂ rotational axis of symmetry** that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 single bond and the C5-C6 single bond.\n    *   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of atoms equivalent.\n        1.

The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are interchanged by the C₂ rotation, making them equivalent. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (in different environments relative to the ring). The two \"inner\" protons are made equivalent by the C₂ axis. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are made equivalent by the C₂ axis. (**Set 4**)\n    *   In total, there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, 4, is `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`, which has **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This number matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its symmetry to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Generation of Reactive Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction begins with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile) and `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` (the diene precursor).\n*   When the precursor is treated with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperatures, a reductive dehalogenation reaction occurs. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups are eliminated, forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   The highly reactive diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (an isomer of o-xylene, also known as isotoluene).\n*   Since two equivalents of this diene are generated and the dienophile has two double bonds, two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions take place to form a large, polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) protecting the C7 bridge is cleaved to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The resulting molecule is **Product 2**, the alcohol analog of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol.\n*   The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n\n*   Product 3 is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat (entropically driven). The fragmentation is especially favored here because it leads to very stable products.\n*   Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile in its oxidized form: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n*   The ketone intermediate, `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`, is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Identifying \"Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final stable organic products of the entire sequence are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecylcohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\".\n\n*   **Benzene:** Due to its high symmetry (D₆h point group), all six hydrogen atoms are chemically identical. Therefore, benzene has only **1** type of distinct hydrogen. This is not among the given options (7, 10, 8, 4).\n*   **5,6-dimethylidenecylcohexa-1,3-diene:** Since benzene is not an option, \"Product 4\" must be this molecule (C₈H₈). To count the distinct hydrogens, we must analyze its symmetry.\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring containing two endocyclic double bonds (at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and two exocyclic double bonds at the adjacent positions (C5=CH₂ and C6=CH₂). The molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry:** It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry makes pairs of atoms equivalent.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence Analysis:**\n        1.  The hydrogen atom on C1 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen atom on C4. (**Set 1**: 2H total)\n        2.  The hydrogen atom on C2 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen atom on C3. (**Set 2**: 2H total)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two hydrogens are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). Let's call them \"inner\" and \"outer\". The C₂ symmetry makes the two \"inner\" hydrogens equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**: 2H total)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ symmetry makes the two \"outer\" hydrogens equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**: 2H total)\n\nThis analysis shows that there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4. This number corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a four-step organic reaction sequence to identify the structure of the final product and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms by analyzing its symmetry.\n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: In Situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   **Dienophile:** `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` is a norbornadiene derivative with two reactive double bonds.\n    *   **Diene Generation:** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive dehalogenation. Taking the name literally, the starting material has a cyclohexadiene core with two `-CHBr₂` groups at the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 positions. NaI removes the four bromine atoms, creating two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    *   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** Two equivalents of this newly formed diene react with the two double bonds of the norbornadiene dienophile in successive [4+2] cycloadditions. This creates a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection**\n    *   **Product 1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard procedure for acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group `(-OtBu)` is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group `(-OH)`, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation**\n    *   **Product 2** is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This mild oxidation converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 position of the bicyclic core into a ketone `(C=O)`. The resulting molecule is **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n    *   **Product 3** is heated to 150°C. High temperatures favor the reverse of a Diels-Alder reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This process is particularly favorable here because it leads to the formation of very stable small molecules.\n    *   **Fragmentation:** Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts:\n        *   Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n        *   One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    *   **Further Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release a molecule of carbon monoxide `(CO)` and form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   The stable organic products in the final mixture are therefore benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n\n### Identification of Final Product 4 and Symmetry Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\".

The four bromine atoms are removed from the two `-CHBr₂` groups, leading to the formation of two exocyclic double bonds. The product is the highly reactive diene **`5,6-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (also known as isotoluene).\n*   **Cycloaddition:** This generated diene acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.

This number corresponds to option D in the provided choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe problem describes a four-step chemical synthesis, and asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product, which requires determining its molecular structure.\n\n1.  **Step 1: In situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   **Reactants:** The reaction begins with `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (the dienophile) and `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` (the diene precursor).\n    *   **Diene Formation:** The most direct chemical interpretation of the reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a double reductive elimination. This reaction generates `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`, a reactive triene.\n    *   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** The generated diene then reacts with the dienophile. Since two equivalents of the diene are formed and the dienophile possesses two double bonds, two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions occur. This results in the formation of a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The tert-butoxy group (`-O-tBu`) attached to the bicyclic core is converted into a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation procedure that converts the secondary alcohol at the bridge position into a ketone (a carbonyl group, `C=O`). The resulting molecule is **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Retro-Diels-Alder)**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\n    *   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat. The fragmentation is particularly favorable here as it leads to very stable products.\n    *   **Fragmentation Products:** Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts: two molecules of the initial diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core (`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`).\n    *   **Further Reaction:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Analysis of the \"Final Product 4\"\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must identify \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of distinct hydrogens in each to the provided options.\n\n*   **Benzene:** Has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen atom due to its high symmetry. This is not among the choices (7, 10, 8, 4).\n*   **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene:** This must be the intended \"Product 4\". We need to analyze its structure to determine the number of distinct hydrogen environments.\n    *   **Structure and Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic `(=CH₂)` groups at C5 and C6. It possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** This C₂ symmetry dictates the equivalence of the hydrogen atoms.\n        1.  The proton on C1 is chemically equivalent to the proton on C4. (**Set 1**: 2H total)\n        2.  The proton on C2 is chemically equivalent to the proton on C3. (**Set 2**: 2H total)\n        3.  The two exocyclic `(=CH₂)` groups are equivalent. Within each group, the two protons are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). The two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other by the C₂ rotation. (**Set 3**: 2H total)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**: 2H total)\n\nThis analysis shows that there are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would lead to 4 signals in a proton NMR spectrum. This number matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to identify the structure of the final product (\"4\") and then determine the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms by analyzing its molecular symmetry.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the chemical transformations and key analysis points:\n\n### Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This molecule contains two reactive C=C double bonds within a norbornadiene framework.\n*   **Diene Generation:** The molecule `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is treated with sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature. This is a reductive elimination reaction. The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups (located at the C5 and C6 positions of the cyclohexadiene ring) are removed to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   **Reactive Intermediate (Diene):** The diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Cycloaddition:** Since two equivalents of the diene are generated, they react with the two double bonds of the dienophile in two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions. This results in the formation of a large, complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n### Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-O-tBu) group at the C7 position of the central bicyclic core is cleaved and replaced with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming **Product 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃-pyridine complex in DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation procedure that converts the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O). The product of this step is **Product 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Thermal Decomposition\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3, a large double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** This is the most critical step. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat (driven by an increase in entropy). Product 3 fragments back into its constituent building blocks.\n    *   **Products of Fragmentation:** The reaction yields two molecules of the original diene, **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**, and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    *   **Further Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Analysis of the Final Product \"4\"\n\nThe final mixture of stable organic products contains benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4.\" We must check which of the products corresponds to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n1.  **Benzene:** Has only **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen due to its high symmetry. This is not among the options.\n2.  **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** This must be the intended \"Product 4\". We analyze its structure for symmetry.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Equivalent Hydrogens:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two protons are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons (one on each methylene group) are equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n\nThis analysis reveals that `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` has a total of **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Generation of the Reactive Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction starts with `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The NaI acts as a reductant, causing a double dehalogenation of the two `-CHBr₂` groups to form two exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   The highly reactive intermediate generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. This is the key diene for the subsequent reaction.\n*   This diene then reacts with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. Since the problem specifies two equivalents of the diene precursor and the dienophile has two double bonds, two sequential Diels-Alder reactions occur. This produces a large, complex polycyclic ether, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that cleaves the tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` group at the C7 bridge position is converted to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation specific for converting the secondary alcohol at the C7 position into a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Retro-Diels-Alder Reaction)**\n\n*   Product 3, the large double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. High temperatures favor the reverse of the Diels-Alder reaction, a process known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This is the most crucial and chemically sound step to analyze.\n*   The fragmentation breaks Product 3 down into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile, which is now a ketone: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n*   This ketone intermediate is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination reaction, losing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form another highly stable molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Analysis of \"Final Product 4\"**\n\nThe final mixture contains two major stable organic products: benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. We must identify which of these is the intended \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of their distinct hydrogen atoms to the given options.\n\n1.  **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. Therefore, benzene has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen. This is not among the options (10, 4, 8, 7).\n2.  **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈):** This must be \"Product 4\". To find the number of distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze its symmetry.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the middle of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        *   **Set 1:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 2:** The hydrogens on the ring carbons C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Set 3:** The C₂ axis exchanges the two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂). The two protons on each methylene group are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons (one on each group) are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n        *   **Set 4:** Likewise, the two \"outer\" protons (one on each group) are made equivalent by the C₂ axis.\n\nThis analysis shows that there are a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This would correspond to four signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThis number matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of a four-step reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of that product's symmetry to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Generation of the Diene and Double Diels-Alder Reaction (Formation of Product 1)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Identifying the Reactive Diene):** The starting material `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` reacts with sodium iodide (NaI). This is a well-known reductive dehalogenation reaction. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the C5 and C6 carbons of the ring undergo elimination of the four bromine atoms, forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The resulting reactive species is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. This is the most direct and chemically literal interpretation of the problem statement.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (The Cycloaddition):** The problem states that 2 equivalents of this diene precursor are used with the dienophile, `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. The dienophile has two reactive double bonds. Therefore, two sequential Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloadditions occur, forming a large, polycyclic adduct, which is **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Identifying the Reaction):** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard protocol for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tert-butoxy` (-OtBu) group at the C7 position of the central bicyclic framework is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Identifying the Reagent):** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This reagent system is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation. It is a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The C7 hydroxyl group is oxidized to a carbonyl (C=O) group, yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Product 4)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5 (Identifying the Thermal Reaction):** Product 3, a complex double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are thermally reversible. The most expected and common pathway at elevated temperatures is a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**.\n*   **Careful Point 6 (Fragmentation and Subsequent Reactions):** The fragmentation proceeds as follows:\n    1.  Product 3 breaks down into its original building blocks: two molecules of the diene (`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`) and one molecule of the oxidized dienophile core, which is `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    2.  This intermediate, `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`, is known to be thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene**.\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the Final Product and Counting Hydrogens**\n\n*   **Careful Point 7 (Choosing the Correct Product):** The final stable organic products in the mixture are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\".\n    *   Benzene (C₆H₆) is highly symmetric and all six hydrogens are equivalent. It has **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This number is not among the options (7, 4, 10, 8).\n    *   Therefore, \"final product 4\" must be the other major organic product: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n*   **Careful Point 8 (Symmetry Analysis):** We must analyze the symmetry of `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈) to count the non-equivalent hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the centers of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   This symmetry operation creates sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent. (Set 1)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 and the hydrogen on C3 are equivalent. (Set 2)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two hydrogens are in different environments (diastereotopic). The C₂ axis relates the two \"inner\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (Set 3)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ axis relates the two \"outer\" hydrogens, making them equivalent. (Set 4)\n    *   This gives a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe calculated number, 4, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, we must first deduce the structure of that product by carefully analyzing each step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: In-situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene`. This molecule, a norbornadiene derivative, contains two double bonds that are active in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Diene Generation:** The reaction involves `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` and sodium iodide (NaI). The reaction of a gem-dibromide (like -CHBr₂) with NaI is a known method for reductive elimination to form a double bond. In this case, the two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 atoms of the cyclohexadiene ring react to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   **Reactive Diene:** The diene generated *in situ* is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** (also known as isotoluene). This is the most direct and chemically sound interpretation of the given starting material.\n*   **Cycloaddition:** The problem states that 2 equivalents of the diene precursor are used. Thus, two molecules of the generated diene react with the two double bonds of the dienophile in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions. This forms a large, complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Acidic Deprotection (Formation of Product 2)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an acid-labile tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (`-OtBu`) at the C7 position of the bicyclic core is cleaved and replaced by a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), forming **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a mild oxidation specific for converting alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (carbonyl group, `C=O`), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Final Product 4)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\n*   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat (due to an increase in entropy). This is the most expected fate for a complex Diels-Alder adduct under thermal stress.\n*   **Fragmentation Products:** Product 3 fragments back into its constituent building blocks:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile, which is now a ketone: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Subsequent Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, losing a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Identifying \"Final Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens\n\nThe final mixture contains two stable organic products: benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\". We must evaluate which of these products corresponds to one of the options: A) 8, B) 7, C) 10, D) 4.\n\n*   **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high D₆h symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically identical.

This reagent causes a reductive elimination of all four bromine atoms, forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The resulting reactive diene formed *in situ* is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This is the most direct and chemically accurate interpretation of the starting material as named.\n*   **Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**: The dienophile possesses two double bonds. Since two equivalents of the diene are generated, two sequential [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions occur.

While the naming in the problem might be slightly non-standard or contain a typo for a more common precursor, the intended reactive intermediate is a diene like `o-xylylene` or one of its isomers. The most direct interpretation of the name provided generates **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** (also known as isotoluene).\n*   **Cycloaddition:** This generated diene reacts with the dienophile in two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions, as two equivalents are used and the dienophile has two double bonds. This forms a large, complex, polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n### Step 2: Acidic Deprotection\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (`-OtBu`) on the C7 bridge of the norbornane core is converted to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), forming **Product 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Oxidation\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to convert the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (`C=O`), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Thermal Decomposition\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder**, is strongly favored by heat (entropy) and the potential to form very stable molecules. Product 3 fragments back into its constituent parts.\n*   **Decomposition Products:**\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene are regenerated: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core is released: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Further Decomposition:** The bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Analysis of the \"Final Product 4\"\nThe stable organic products of the entire sequence are benzene and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. We must determine which of these is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of their distinct hydrogen atoms to the given options.\n\n*   **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high D₆h symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically identical. Benzene has **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen. This is not among the options (7, 10, 4, 8).\n*   **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (C₈H₈):** Since benzene is not a possible answer, \"Product 4\" must be this regenerated diene. We must analyze its structure for symmetry to count its distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Equivalent Hydrogens:** This symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (`=CH₂`) are interchanged by the C₂ axis. Within each methylene group, the two protons are in different chemical environments relative to the ring (they are diastereotopic). The C₂ axis makes the two \"inner\" hydrogens (closer to the ring diene) equivalent. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" hydrogens are equivalent.

A consensus emerges from the provided answers by following the most chemically plausible and direct reaction pathway.\n\n**Step 1: Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants**: The reaction involves `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` (a dienophile with two double bonds) and `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` (a diene precursor).\n*   **Diene Generation**: Treating the diene precursor with sodium iodide (NaI) causes a reductive dehalogenation. The two `-CHBr₂` groups on the sp³-hybridized carbons (C5 and C6) of the cyclohexadiene ring are eliminated to form two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The resulting reactive species is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n*   **Cycloaddition**: Since two equivalents of the diene are generated, they react with the two double bonds of the dienophile in successive [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions. This creates a large, complex, polycyclic ether, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis (Formation of Product 2)**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acid-catalyzed deprotection that cleaves the tert-butyl ether protecting group.\n*   The tert-butoxy group `(-OtBu)` is converted into a hydroxyl group `(-OH)`, yielding the alcohol **Product 2**. This step is straightforward and all analyses agree.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidation specific for converting the secondary alcohol `(-OH)` into a ketone `(C=O)`.\n*   This transforms the C7 alcohol group into a ketone, resulting in **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Final Product 4)**\n\n*   Product 3, a large Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and at elevated temperatures, the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is strongly favored, especially when it leads to stable products.\n*   **Fragmentation**: Product 3 fragments back into its original constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n    2.  One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   **Further Reaction**: The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Identifying \"Final Product 4\" and Counting Its Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe stable organic products from the final step are benzene and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. We must determine which of these is \"Product 4\" by comparing the number of their distinct hydrogens to the given options.\n\n*   **Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms are chemically identical. Benzene has **1** chemically distinct type of hydrogen. This is not among the options (8, 4, 10, 7).\n*   **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (C₈H₈):** This must be \"Product 4\". We analyze its structure to count the distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry**: The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the middle of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence**: This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of atoms equivalent:\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are interchanged by rotation. Within each methylene group, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments, \"inner\" vs. \"outer\"). The two \"inner\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Similarly, the two \"outer\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n\nThis analysis reveals **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.

The most direct and chemically sound interpretation of this is a reductive dehalogenation reaction that forms two new double bonds. The `tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` is a dienophile with two reactive sites.\n*   **Diene Formed:** The elimination reaction generates the highly reactive diene `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` *in situ*.\n*   **Cycloaddition:** Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, two molecules of the generated diene react with the two double bonds of the norbornadiene-based dienophile. This forms a large polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis (Deprotection)**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that cleaves the tert-butyl ether.

The hydroxyl group at the C7 position of the norbornane core is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), forming **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Transformation:** The most expected thermal reaction for a complex Diels-Alder adduct is a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. The reaction is driven by a large increase in entropy and the formation of highly stable molecules. Product 3 fragments back into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the regenerated diene: `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n    2.  One molecule of `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n*   **Further Decomposition:** The bicyclic ketone intermediate is itself thermally unstable and rapidly undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Identifying \"Final Product 4\" and Counting Its Hydrogens\n\nThe final stable organic products are **benzene** and **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**. The question asks for the number of distinct hydrogens on \"Product 4\".\n\n*   **Benzene:** Has only **1** type of chemically distinct hydrogen due to its high symmetry. \"1\" is not among the options.\n*   **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`:** This C₈H₈ molecule must be Product 4. To count its distinct hydrogens, we must analyze its symmetry.\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring containing two internal double bonds (C1=C2, C3=C4) and a single bond between C2 and C3. At positions C5 and C6, there are exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`), and there is a single bond between C5 and C6. The entire system of 8 carbons is sp²-hybridized and conjugated.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   **Equivalence Analysis:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent:\n        1.

This creates **Product 2**, the corresponding alcohol.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation (Formation of Product 3)**\n    *   Product 2 is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidizing agent that converts the secondary alcohol (`-OH`) at the C7 position into a ketone (`C=O`). This produces **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition (Formation of Product 4)**\n    *   Product 3, which is a complex double Diels-Alder adduct, is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and this thermal energy induces the reverse reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   **Fragmentation:** Product 3 fragments back into its original constituent molecules (or their post-reaction derivatives). This yields:\n        *   Two molecules of the regenerated diene: `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n        *   One molecule of the core dienophile, which is now a ketone: `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`.\n    *   **Further Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is known to be thermally unstable.

To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we analyze its symmetry. The molecule has a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n\nThis symmetry results in the following hydrogen equivalences:\n*   The hydrogen on C1 and the hydrogen on C4 are equivalent.

The four bromine atoms from the two `-CHBr₂` groups are eliminated, forming two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`).\n*   The highly reactive diene formed *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`** (an isomer of o-xylene, also known as isotoluene).\n*   Since two equivalents of this diene are generated and the dienophile has two double bonds, two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions take place to form a large, polycyclic adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Deprotection of the Ether**\n\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) protecting the C7 bridge is cleaved to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The resulting molecule is **Product 2**, the alcohol analog of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation of the Alcohol**\n\n*   Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol.\n*   The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n\n*   Product 3 is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are reversible, and the reverse reaction, a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**, is favored by heat (entropically driven). The fragmentation is especially favored here because it leads to very stable products.\n*   Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts:\n    1.  Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    2.  One molecule of the core dienophile in its oxidized form: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n*   The ketone intermediate, `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`, is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination, extruding a stable molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Identifying \"Product 4\" and Counting Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final stable organic products of the entire sequence are benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecylcohexa-1,3-diene`. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\".\n\n*   **Benzene:** Due to its high symmetry (D₆h point group), all six hydrogen atoms are chemically identical. Therefore, benzene has only **1** type of distinct hydrogen. This is not among the given options (7, 10, 8, 4).\n*   **5,6-dimethylidenecylcohexa-1,3-diene:** Since benzene is not an option, \"Product 4\" must be this molecule (C₈H₈). To count the distinct hydrogens, we must analyze its symmetry.\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring containing two endocyclic double bonds (at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and two exocyclic double bonds at the adjacent positions (C5=CH₂ and C6=CH₂). The molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry:** It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry makes pairs of atoms equivalent.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence Analysis:**\n        1.  The hydrogen atom on C1 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen atom on C4. (**Set 1**: 2H total)\n        2.  The hydrogen atom on C2 is chemically equivalent to the hydrogen atom on C3. (**Set 2**: 2H total)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂) are equivalent. Within each methylene group, the two hydrogens are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). Let's call them \"inner\" and \"outer\". The C₂ symmetry makes the two \"inner\" hydrogens equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**: 2H total)\n        4.  Similarly, the C₂ symmetry makes the two \"outer\" hydrogens equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**: 2H total)\n\nThis analysis shows that there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4. This number corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a four-step organic reaction sequence to identify the structure of the final product and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms by analyzing its symmetry.\n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: In Situ Diene Generation and Double Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   **Dienophile:** `7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene` is a norbornadiene derivative with two reactive double bonds.\n    *   **Diene Generation:** The reaction of `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` with sodium iodide (NaI) is a reductive dehalogenation. Taking the name literally, the starting material has a cyclohexadiene core with two `-CHBr₂` groups at the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 positions. NaI removes the four bromine atoms, creating two new exocyclic double bonds (`=CH₂`). The diene generated *in situ* is **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n    *   **Diels-Alder Reaction:** Two equivalents of this newly formed diene react with the two double bonds of the norbornadiene dienophile in successive [4+2] cycloadditions. This creates a large, polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Deprotection**\n    *   **Product 1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard procedure for acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group `(-OtBu)` is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group `(-OH)`, yielding **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Oxidation**\n    *   **Product 2** is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This mild oxidation converts the secondary alcohol at the C7 position of the bicyclic core into a ketone `(C=O)`. The resulting molecule is **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition**\n    *   **Product 3** is heated to 150°C. High temperatures favor the reverse of a Diels-Alder reaction, known as a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. This process is particularly favorable here because it leads to the formation of very stable small molecules.\n    *   **Fragmentation:** Product 3 decomposes back into its constituent parts:\n        *   Two molecules of the original diene: **`5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`**.\n        *   One molecule of the oxidized dienophile core: **`bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one`**.\n    *   **Further Decomposition:** The `bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one` intermediate is itself thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to release a molecule of carbon monoxide `(CO)` and form the highly stable aromatic molecule **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   The stable organic products in the final mixture are therefore benzene and `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene`.\n\n### Identification of Final Product 4 and Symmetry Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\". We must determine which of the final organic products fits the multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Benzene (C₆H₆):** Due to its high symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms in benzene are chemically equivalent. It has only **1** distinct type of hydrogen. This is not among the options (8, 10, 7, 4).\n*   **Candidate 2: `5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene` (C₈H₈):** Since benzene is not a valid option, this must be \"Product 4\". We must analyze its symmetry to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a C₂ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 single bond and the C5-C6 single bond.\n    *   **Hydrogen Equivalence:** This C₂ symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n        1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (**Set 1**)\n        2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (**Set 2**)\n        3.  The two exocyclic methylene `(=CH₂)` groups are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. Within each group, the two protons are in different environments (diastereotopic). The two \"inner\" protons (one on each methylene group) are equivalent to each other. (**Set 3**)\n        4.  Likewise, the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. (**Set 4**)\n\nThis analysis reveals a total of **4** chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. This number corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
