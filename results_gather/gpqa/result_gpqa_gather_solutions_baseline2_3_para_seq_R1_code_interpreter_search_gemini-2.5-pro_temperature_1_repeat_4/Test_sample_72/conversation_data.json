Solving this requires the correct application of formulas from the special theory of relativity.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\nThe relative speed between two objects moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light is not found by simple subtraction. The relativistic velocity subtraction formula must be used. For two objects moving in the same direction with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative speed $v_{rel}$ is:\n$$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n**Calculation:**\n*   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Substitute the values:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$$\n*   Result:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This would incorrectly point towards option A. The relativistic correction in the denominator is crucial.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\nThe total energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of the individual total energies of each particle as measured in a stationary reference frame. The total energy of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n\n**Formula for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$\nThe total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$.\n*   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$.\n*   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$.\n\n**Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$.\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The question asks for total energy, not rest energy. The total rest energy of the system would be $(m_1 + m_2)c^2 = (2m + 3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$. This is the energy part of option B and is incorrect.\n2.  The total energy is the sum of the *individual* relativistic energies. You must calculate the energy for each astronaut with their specific mass and velocity before adding them. You cannot sum the masses or velocities first.\n3.  The calculation uses the velocities ($0.6c$ and $0.5c$) relative to the stationary observer, not the relative velocity ($0.14c$).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed is **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n*   The total energy of the system is **E ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) **v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a rigorous verification of the physics and calculations.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\nThe question requires two separate calculations using the principles of special relativity:\n1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n2.  The total energy ($E$) of the two-astronaut system in a stationary frame of reference.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Astronaut 1: Rest mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n*   Astronaut 2: Rest mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Both astronauts are traveling in the same direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nThe calculation must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: A common mistake is to use classical mechanics and simply subtract the velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This is incorrect because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The correct formula is:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E$)**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The total energy is the sum of the individual energies ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). One cannot sum the masses or velocities first. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, not just rest energy ($m_0 c^2$) or kinetic energy.\n*   The Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n        $$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$$\n    *   Next, calculate the energy, $E_1$:\n        $$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n        $$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$$\n    *   Next, calculate the energy, $E_2$:\n        $$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   Finally, sum the individual energies:\n        $$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe independent, step-by-step analysis yields the following results:\n*   **Relative Speed**: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   **Total Energy**: $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nComparing this pair of values with the options provided in the question:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) **v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated results perfectly match option B. The submitted candidate answers almost universally agree on the numerical results but show confusion about the correct option letter, which indicates they were likely given randomized option lists. Based on the problem as stated, B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers and the physics problem reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical values. The discrepancy among the candidates' chosen letters (A, B, C, D) is due to their being presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The most reliable approach is to perform the calculation from first principles and match the result to the authoritative list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem has two parts: calculating the relative speed ($v_{rel}$) and the total energy of the system ($E_{total}$). Both calculations must use formulas from the theory of special relativity.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: At speeds close to the speed of light, one must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Simply subtracting the speeds ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$) is a common mistake and is incorrect.\n*   **Formula**: For objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Calculation**: With $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result**: Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* of each astronaut. It is not the rest energy or kinetic energy. The calculation must be done for each astronaut separately before summing.\n*   **Formula**: The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. The system's total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Speed $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Speed $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result**: Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous calculation yields a relative speed of $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and a total energy of $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$. These results are in agreement with the calculations performed by all candidate agents.\n\nNow, we match these values to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   **B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated pair of values exactly matches the pair in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers from other agents, there is a clear consensus on the physical principles and calculations, but a discrepancy in the final letter chosen. This suggests the agents were working with differently ordered multiple-choice options.

The confusion among the provided agents stemmed from variations in their option lists, not from errors in their physics calculations.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct relative speed and total energy for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic velocities. An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals that they all reach the same numerical conclusion through correct application of special relativity principles. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, etc.) indicates they were likely presented with a shuffled list of options. The correct approach is to independently verify the calculation and then match the result to the definitive list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we cannot use classical velocity subtraction ($v_1 - v_2$). The correct formula is the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction:\n$$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n*   **Given values:** $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$$\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts as measured from a stationary reference frame ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). The total energy of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m, Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m, Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Formulas:** The most common error is using classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$) instead of the correct relativistic formula.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** Another potential error is to calculate only the total rest energy ($E_{rest} = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$) and neglect the kinetic energy. The question asks for the total energy ($E = E_{rest} + K$), which is encapsulated in the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual components, each calculated with its own mass and Lorentz factor. One should not combine the masses or velocities before the energy calculation.\n4.  **Option Matching:** As evidenced by the candidate answers, after correctly calculating the values, it is crucial to carefully match the resulting pair (`v_rel ≈ 0.14c`, `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`) to the provided list of options.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOur calculations, which are in agreement with the consensus from all provided candidate answers, yield a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total energy of approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nComparing this result to the specific options given in the question:\n*   A) `v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2`\n*   B) `v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2`\n*   C) `v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2`\n*   D) `v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2`\n\nThe calculated values exactly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and an independent verification of the physics, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires two separate calculations from the theory of special relativity.\n\n**1.

The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n    *   Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy ($E_1$) = $(1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n    *   Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy ($E_2$) = $(1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives a total energy of **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Relativistic Velocity Subtraction:** It is crucial to use the relativistic formula for relative velocity. A common mistake is to perform classical subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$), which would incorrectly point to option D.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** The question asks for the total energy ($E = \\gamma m c^2$), not the total rest energy. Calculating the total rest energy ($m_{total}c^2 = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$) is incorrect and would lead to the wrong energy value seen in option A.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies calculated for each particle *individually*. One cannot sum the masses and then perform a single energy calculation, as the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is non-linear and different for each astronaut.\n4.  **Consensus vs. Mapping:** All candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct numerical results ($0.14c$ and $5.96 mc^2$). The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to differences in the multiple-choice lists they were shown. The final task is to map the correct numerical result to the option list provided in this problem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculations yield:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this pair of values with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated results perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals that while the agents arrive at different final lettered choices (A, B, C, D), their underlying physics calculations are overwhelmingly consistent and correct.

The question also asks for total energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), not just kinetic or rest energy.\n*   **Formula:** The total energy for a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Speed $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Speed $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result for Energy:** Rounding to two decimal places gives **$E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous calculation gives the following results:\n*   **Relative speed ($v_{rel}$): 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy ($E$): 5.96 mc²**\n\nNow, we match this pair of values to the options provided in the question:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation methodology and the numerical results.

The core physics and mathematics are sound across the provided answers. The correct approach is to perform the calculation and then match the result to the specific options given in this problem's prompt.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis with careful points noted.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Use the Relativistic Velocity Subtraction Formula.**\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light, c), classical velocity subtraction ($v_1 - v_2$) is incorrect. The correct formula, derived from Lorentz transformations for objects moving in the same direction, is:\n$$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Substitute the values into the formula:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$$\n*   The result is:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E$)**\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate Individual Total Energies and Sum Them.**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of each individual astronaut as measured in the stationary reference frame. It is incorrect to first combine the masses or use the relative velocity in the energy calculation. The formula for a single particle's total energy is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Correctly Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) for Each Astronaut.**\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, depends on each astronaut's individual speed.\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$, Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$$\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$, Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$$\n\n**Calculation for Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   Sum the individual energies:\n    $$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOur calculations yield the following values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$) = 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$) = 5.96 mc²**\n\nNow, we match this pair of results to the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and the physics of the problem, here is a step-by-step verification to determine the correct solution.\n\n### **Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nThe candidate answers show a remarkable consistency in their calculation methods and numerical results.\n1.  **Relative Speed:** All agents who show their work correctly use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula and arrive at the value `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n2.  **Total Energy:** All agents correctly calculate the individual relativistic energies of each astronaut and sum them to arrive at `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\nThe only discrepancy is in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This strongly suggests that the agents were presented with different or shuffled lists of options. Therefore, the most reliable method is to ignore the final letter choices of the agents, trust the consensus on the numerical values, and match these values to the specific options provided in the problem description.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Verification**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as classical subtraction is inaccurate for speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula:** For objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed is $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$.\n*   **Given:** $v_1 = 0.6c$, $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of each astronaut.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   **Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Speed $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$.\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$.\n*   **Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Speed $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$.\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$.\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$.\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Velocity Formula:** It is crucial to use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction. A classical subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c$) would yield an incorrect speed of $0.1c$, leading to option C.\n2.  **Energy Calculation:** The total energy is the sum of the individual *total energies* ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), not just rest energies ($E=mc^2$) or kinetic energies ($K=(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n3.  **Individual Calculations:** Each astronaut has a unique mass and Lorentz factor. Their energies must be calculated separately before being summed. It is incorrect to sum the masses first.\n4.  **Option Matching:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was matching the correct calculations to the wrong option letter due to shuffled option lists. The final check must be against the option list in the original problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe verified calculations are:\n*   Relative speed: **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**\n*   Total energy: **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**\n\nMatching this pair of values to the provided options:\n*   A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   B) **v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting important points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Analysis of the Task**\n\nThe goal is to find the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical values, but they differ on the final lettered choice. This indicates that the core physics was likely handled correctly by most, but there may have been confusion in matching the result to a specific set of A, B, C, D options. My analysis will independently verify the calculations and then match the result to the definitive list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must be done using the principles of Special Relativity, as the astronauts are traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Principle:** Relativistic velocity subtraction for objects moving in the same direction.\n*   **Formula:** $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n**Careful Point 1: Avoid Classical Subtraction**\nA common mistake is to simply subtract the speeds classically: $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$. This is incorrect and would lead to the wrong answer (e.g., option A).

Their relative speed ($v_{rel}$).\n2.  The total energy ($E$) of the system.\n\nBoth calculations must use formulas from the special theory of relativity.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n**Principle:** For objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. The relativistic velocity subtraction formula must be used. For two objects moving in the same direction with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$, the formula is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n**Given:**\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n**Calculation:**\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\n**Principle:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The total energy of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is its rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Formula for Lorentz Factor:**\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n1.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Velocity:** The most common mistake is to calculate relative velocity classically ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores relativistic effects and leads to an incorrect answer (option A).\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** One might incorrectly sum the rest masses and calculate the rest energy of the system ($E = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$). This neglects the kinetic energy from their motion and leads to an incorrect answer (option C).\n3.  **Correct Energy Calculation:** The total energy is the sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* ($E_1+E_2$), each calculated with its own mass and Lorentz factor. It is not calculated using the total mass and some average velocity.\n4.  **Option Matching:** The provided candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the numerical results ($0.14c$ and $5.96 mc^2$), but disagree on the final lettered option. This highlights that the agents were likely presented with scrambled options.

Solving this requires the correct application of formulas from the special theory of relativity.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\nThe relative speed between two objects moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light is not found by simple subtraction. The relativistic velocity subtraction formula must be used. For two objects moving in the same direction with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$, their relative speed $v_{rel}$ is:\n$$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n**Calculation:**\n*   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Substitute the values:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$$\n*   Result:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to use classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This would incorrectly point towards option A. The relativistic correction in the denominator is crucial.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\nThe total energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of the individual total energies of each particle as measured in a stationary reference frame. The total energy of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n\n**Formula for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$\nThe total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$.\n*   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$.\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$.\n*   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$.\n\n**Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$.\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The question asks for total energy, not rest energy. The total rest energy of the system would be $(m_1 + m_2)c^2 = (2m + 3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$. This is the energy part of option B and is incorrect.\n2.  The total energy is the sum of the *individual* relativistic energies. You must calculate the energy for each astronaut with their specific mass and velocity before adding them. You cannot sum the masses or velocities first.\n3.  The calculation uses the velocities ($0.6c$ and $0.5c$) relative to the stationary observer, not the relative velocity ($0.14c$).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed is **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n*   The total energy of the system is **E ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) **v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a rigorous verification of the physics and calculations.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\nThe question requires two separate calculations using the principles of special relativity:\n1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n2.  The total energy ($E$) of the two-astronaut system in a stationary frame of reference.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Astronaut 1: Rest mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n*   Astronaut 2: Rest mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Both astronauts are traveling in the same direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nThe calculation must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: A common mistake is to use classical mechanics and simply subtract the velocities ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This is incorrect because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The correct formula is:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n\n*   **Calculation**:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E$)**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The total energy is the sum of the individual energies ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). One cannot sum the masses or velocities first. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, not just rest energy ($m_0 c^2$) or kinetic energy.\n*   The Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n        $$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$$\n    *   Next, calculate the energy, $E_1$:\n        $$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n        $$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$$\n    *   Next, calculate the energy, $E_2$:\n        $$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   Finally, sum the individual energies:\n        $$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe independent, step-by-step analysis yields the following results:\n*   **Relative Speed**: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   **Total Energy**: $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nComparing this pair of values with the options provided in the question:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) **v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated results perfectly match option B. The submitted candidate answers almost universally agree on the numerical results but show confusion about the correct option letter, which indicates they were likely given randomized option lists. Based on the problem as stated, B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers and the physics problem reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical values. The discrepancy among the candidates' chosen letters (A, B, C, D) is due to their being presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options. The most reliable approach is to perform the calculation from first principles and match the result to the authoritative list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem has two parts: calculating the relative speed ($v_{rel}$) and the total energy of the system ($E_{total}$). Both calculations must use formulas from the theory of special relativity.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: At speeds close to the speed of light, one must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Simply subtracting the speeds ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$) is a common mistake and is incorrect.\n*   **Formula**: For objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Calculation**: With $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result**: Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* of each astronaut. It is not the rest energy or kinetic energy. The calculation must be done for each astronaut separately before summing.\n*   **Formula**: The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. The system's total energy is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Speed $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Speed $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result**: Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous calculation yields a relative speed of $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and a total energy of $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$. These results are in agreement with the calculations performed by all candidate agents.\n\nNow, we match these values to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   **B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated pair of values exactly matches the pair in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers from other agents, there is a clear consensus on the physical principles and calculations, but a discrepancy in the final letter chosen. This suggests the agents were working with differently ordered multiple-choice options.

The confusion among the provided agents stemmed from variations in their option lists, not from errors in their physics calculations.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct relative speed and total energy for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic velocities. An analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals that they all reach the same numerical conclusion through correct application of special relativity principles. The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, etc.) indicates they were likely presented with a shuffled list of options. The correct approach is to independently verify the calculation and then match the result to the definitive list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we cannot use classical velocity subtraction ($v_1 - v_2$). The correct formula is the relativistic velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction:\n$$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n*   **Given values:** $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$$\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts as measured from a stationary reference frame ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$). The total energy of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m, Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m, Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Classical vs. Relativistic Formulas:** The most common error is using classical velocity subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$) instead of the correct relativistic formula.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** Another potential error is to calculate only the total rest energy ($E_{rest} = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$) and neglect the kinetic energy. The question asks for the total energy ($E = E_{rest} + K$), which is encapsulated in the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual components, each calculated with its own mass and Lorentz factor. One should not combine the masses or velocities before the energy calculation.\n4.  **Option Matching:** As evidenced by the candidate answers, after correctly calculating the values, it is crucial to carefully match the resulting pair (`v_rel ≈ 0.14c`, `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`) to the provided list of options.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOur calculations, which are in agreement with the consensus from all provided candidate answers, yield a relative speed of approximately **0.14c** and a total energy of approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nComparing this result to the specific options given in the question:\n*   A) `v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2`\n*   B) `v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2`\n*   C) `v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2`\n*   D) `v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2`\n\nThe calculated values exactly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and an independent verification of the physics, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires two separate calculations from the theory of special relativity.\n\n**1.

The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n    *   Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy ($E_1$) = $(1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n    *   Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy ($E_2$) = $(1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives a total energy of **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Relativistic Velocity Subtraction:** It is crucial to use the relativistic formula for relative velocity. A common mistake is to perform classical subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$), which would incorrectly point to option D.\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** The question asks for the total energy ($E = \\gamma m c^2$), not the total rest energy. Calculating the total rest energy ($m_{total}c^2 = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$) is incorrect and would lead to the wrong energy value seen in option A.\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies calculated for each particle *individually*. One cannot sum the masses and then perform a single energy calculation, as the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) is non-linear and different for each astronaut.\n4.  **Consensus vs. Mapping:** All candidate answers show a strong consensus on the correct numerical results ($0.14c$ and $5.96 mc^2$). The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to differences in the multiple-choice lists they were shown. The final task is to map the correct numerical result to the option list provided in this problem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculations yield:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing this pair of values with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated results perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals that while the agents arrive at different final lettered choices (A, B, C, D), their underlying physics calculations are overwhelmingly consistent and correct.

The question also asks for total energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), not just kinetic or rest energy.\n*   **Formula:** The total energy for a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Speed $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Speed $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n*   **Result for Energy:** Rounding to two decimal places gives **$E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous calculation gives the following results:\n*   **Relative speed ($v_{rel}$): 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy ($E$): 5.96 mc²**\n\nNow, we match this pair of values to the options provided in the question:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation methodology and the numerical results.

The core physics and mathematics are sound across the provided answers. The correct approach is to perform the calculation and then match the result to the specific options given in this problem's prompt.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis with careful points noted.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Use the Relativistic Velocity Subtraction Formula.**\nSince the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light, c), classical velocity subtraction ($v_1 - v_2$) is incorrect. The correct formula, derived from Lorentz transformations for objects moving in the same direction, is:\n$$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   Given: $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   Substitute the values into the formula:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$$\n*   The result is:\n    $$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E$)**\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate Individual Total Energies and Sum Them.**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of each individual astronaut as measured in the stationary reference frame. It is incorrect to first combine the masses or use the relative velocity in the energy calculation. The formula for a single particle's total energy is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Correctly Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) for Each Astronaut.**\nThe Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, depends on each astronaut's individual speed.\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$, Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$$\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$, Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$$\n\n**Calculation for Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   Sum the individual energies:\n    $$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$$\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOur calculations yield the following values:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$) = 0.14c**\n*   **Total Energy ($E$) = 5.96 mc²**\n\nNow, we match this pair of results to the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and the physics of the problem, here is a step-by-step verification to determine the correct solution.\n\n### **Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nThe candidate answers show a remarkable consistency in their calculation methods and numerical results.\n1.  **Relative Speed:** All agents who show their work correctly use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula and arrive at the value `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n2.  **Total Energy:** All agents correctly calculate the individual relativistic energies of each astronaut and sum them to arrive at `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\nThe only discrepancy is in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This strongly suggests that the agents were presented with different or shuffled lists of options. Therefore, the most reliable method is to ignore the final letter choices of the agents, trust the consensus on the numerical values, and match these values to the specific options provided in the problem description.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Verification**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as classical subtraction is inaccurate for speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula:** For objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed is $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$.\n*   **Given:** $v_1 = 0.6c$, $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of each astronaut.\n\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   **Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Speed $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$.\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$.\n*   **Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Speed $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$.\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$.\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$.\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Velocity Formula:** It is crucial to use the relativistic formula for velocity subtraction. A classical subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c$) would yield an incorrect speed of $0.1c$, leading to option C.\n2.  **Energy Calculation:** The total energy is the sum of the individual *total energies* ($E = \\gamma mc^2$), not just rest energies ($E=mc^2$) or kinetic energies ($K=(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n3.  **Individual Calculations:** Each astronaut has a unique mass and Lorentz factor. Their energies must be calculated separately before being summed. It is incorrect to sum the masses first.\n4.  **Option Matching:** The most significant source of error among the candidate answers was matching the correct calculations to the wrong option letter due to shuffled option lists. The final check must be against the option list in the original problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe verified calculations are:\n*   Relative speed: **$v_{rel} = 0.14c$**\n*   Total energy: **$E = 5.96 mc^2$**\n\nMatching this pair of values to the provided options:\n*   A) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   B) **v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting important points to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Analysis of the Task**\n\nThe goal is to find the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical values, but they differ on the final lettered choice. This indicates that the core physics was likely handled correctly by most, but there may have been confusion in matching the result to a specific set of A, B, C, D options. My analysis will independently verify the calculations and then match the result to the definitive list of options provided in the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation must be done using the principles of Special Relativity, as the astronauts are traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Principle:** Relativistic velocity subtraction for objects moving in the same direction.\n*   **Formula:** $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n**Careful Point 1: Avoid Classical Subtraction**\nA common mistake is to simply subtract the speeds classically: $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$. This is incorrect and would lead to the wrong answer (e.g., option A).

The confusion among the candidate answers is due to inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options they were shown, not to any error in the physics calculations, which were universally correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, considering the provided answers and identifying crucial points for accuracy.\n\n### **Analysis of the Task**\n\nThe question asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds:\n1.  Their relative speed ($v_{rel}$).\n2.  The total energy ($E$) of the system.\n\nBoth calculations must use formulas from the special theory of relativity.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n**Principle:** For objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. The relativistic velocity subtraction formula must be used. For two objects moving in the same direction with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$, the formula is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n**Given:**\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n**Calculation:**\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E$)**\n\n**Principle:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The total energy of a single particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is its rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Formula for Lorentz Factor:**\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n1.  **Relativistic vs. Classical Velocity:** The most common mistake is to calculate relative velocity classically ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). This ignores relativistic effects and leads to an incorrect answer (option A).\n2.  **Total Energy vs. Rest Energy:** One might incorrectly sum the rest masses and calculate the rest energy of the system ($E = (2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$). This neglects the kinetic energy from their motion and leads to an incorrect answer (option C).\n3.  **Correct Energy Calculation:** The total energy is the sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* ($E_1+E_2$), each calculated with its own mass and Lorentz factor. It is not calculated using the total mass and some average velocity.\n4.  **Option Matching:** The provided candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the numerical results ($0.14c$ and $5.96 mc^2$), but disagree on the final lettered option. This highlights that the agents were likely presented with scrambled options. The crucial step is to match the correct numerical results to the options listed in the original problem.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe independent and verified calculations yield:\n*   **Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ 0.14c**\n*   **Total energy ($E$) ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the provided options:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values precisely match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis using the principles of special relativity. We need to calculate two distinct quantities: the relative speed of the astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the astronauts are moving at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.

A common mistake might be to calculate the rest energy of the combined masses, $(2m+3m)c^2 = 5mc^2$, leading to an incorrect choice (option B).\n3.  **Sum of Individual Energies:** The total energy is the sum of the two individual astronauts' energies, each calculated with its own mass and its own Lorentz factor.

All candidates correctly calculated the numerical values for the relative speed and the total energy. The only discrepancy lies in which option letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to the correct values, which indicates that the options were likely presented to the agents in a shuffled order.\n\nThe correct approach is to perform the calculation independently and then match the final numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nThis calculation requires the use of the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, as the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, the relative speed $v_{rel}$ is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to use classical subtraction ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$), which ignores relativistic effects and is incorrect.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n*   **Result (Relative Speed):** When rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.
