    "This problem asks for the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges. One charge is at a central point P, and the other 12 are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius R = 2 m centered at P.\n\n### 1. Identify the components of the total energy\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (U_total) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can divide this into two main components:\n1.  **U_center_shell**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (q_c) and the 12 charges on the shell (q_i).\n2.  **U_shell_shell**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the shell.\n\nSo, `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`.\n\n### 2. Define the constants and variables\n\n*   Elementary charge, `e = 1.602176634 x 10^-19 C`.\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`.\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k = 8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2`.\n*   Radius of the sphere, `R = 2 m`.\n*   Number of shell particles, `N = 12`.\n\n### 3. Calculate U_center_shell\n\nThe central charge `q_c = 2e` interacts with each of the 12 shell charges `q_i = 2e`. The distance for each of these interactions is fixed at `R = 2 m`.\n\nThe energy for one such pair is `U_pair = (k * q_c * q_i) / R = k * (2e)^2 / R = 4k * e^2 / R`.\nSince there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this component is:\n`U_center_shell = 12 * (4k * e^2 / R) = 48k * e^2 / R`.\n\nThis value is constant because the distance `R` is fixed.\n\n### 4. Calculate U_shell_shell (The Thomson Problem)\n\nTo find the minimum total energy of the system, we need to find the configuration of the 12 shell charges that minimizes `U_shell_shell`. This is a famous problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**. It seeks the minimum energy configuration of N point charges on the surface of a sphere.\n\nFor `N = 12`, the proven minimum energy configuration is when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\nThe potential energy of the shell charges is given by:\n`U_shell_shell = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij = k * (2e)^2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (1 / r_ij)`.\n\nThe energy for the solution to the Thomson problem is often expressed in a dimensionless form:\n`U_shell_shell = E_N * (k * q^2) / R`, where `q` is the charge of the particles on the shell.\nFor `N = 12`, the dimensionless energy constant `E_12` has been calculated to be `49.165276`.\n\nSo, for our system:\n`q = 2e`\n`U_shell_shell = 49.165276 * k * (2e)^2 / R`\n`U_shell_shell = 49.165276 * 4 * k * e^2 / R = 196.661104 * k * e^2 / R`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the total minimum energy\n\nNow, we sum the two components:\n`U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`\n`U_total = (48 * k * e^2 / R) + (196.661104 * k * e^2 / R)`\n`U_total = (48 + 196.661104) * (k * e^2 / R)`\n`U_total = 244.661104 * (k * e^2 / R)`\n\nWe can now substitute the values of the constants to find the numerical answer. A python script is used for precise calculation.\n\n```python\n# Physical constants\nk = 8.9875517923e9  # Coulomb's constant in N m^2 C^-2\ne = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in C\nR = 2.0             # Radius of the sphere in meters\n\n# The total energy is given by U_total = (48 + 4 * E_12) * (k * e**2 / R),\n# where E_12 is the dimensionless energy for the N=12 Thomson problem.\nE_12 = 49.165276\n\n# Calculate the pre-factor\nfactor = 48 + 4 * E_12\n\n# Calculate the energy unit term\nenergy_unit = (k * e**2) / R\n\n# Calculate the total minimum energy\ntotal_energy = factor * energy_unit\n\nprint(f\"{total_energy:.4e}\")\n```\n>>>\n2.8222e-26\n\nThe calculated minimum energy is `2.8222 x 10^-26` Joules.

    "An isolated system consists of 13 identical particles. Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n- One particle (let's call it `q_c`) is fixed at a point P.\n- The other 12 particles (let's call them `q_s`) are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n\nWe need to find the minimum total electrostatic potential energy of this system.\n\n### 1. Decompose the Total Potential Energy\n\nThe total potential energy `U_total` of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can separate this into two components:\n\n1.  **`U_center_shell`**: The potential energy due to the interaction between the central charge `q_c` and the 12 charges on the shell.\n2.  **`U_shell_shell`**: The potential energy due to the mutual repulsion among the 12 charges on the shell.\n\nThe total energy is `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`.\n\n### 2. Calculate `U_center_shell`\n\nThe central charge `q_c = 2e` interacts with each of the 12 shell charges `q_s = 2e`. The distance for each of these interactions is fixed at the radius of the sphere, `R = 2 m`.\n\nThe potential energy for a single pair of the central charge and one shell charge is:\n`U_pair = (k * q_c * q_s) / R`\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant (`8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2`), and `q_c = q_s = 2e`.\n`U_pair = k * (2e)^2 / R = 4k * e^2 / R`\n\nSince there are 12 such shell charges, the total energy for this component is:\n`U_center_shell = 12 * U_pair = 12 * (4k * e^2 / R) = 48k * e^2 / R`\n\nThis energy is constant, regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere's surface.\n\n### 3. Calculate `U_shell_shell`\n\nTo find the minimum total energy of the system, we need to find the arrangement of the 12 shell charges that minimizes their mutual potential energy, `U_shell_shell`. This is a classic problem known as the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor `N=12` charges on the surface of a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\nThe potential energy of the shell charges is given by:\n`U_shell_shell = sum_{1 <= i < j <= 12} (k * q_s * q_s) / r_ij`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j`.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n`U_shell_shell = (k * q_s^2 / R) * E_N`\nwhere `E_N` is the dimensionless energy constant for the solution to the Thomson problem for N particles. For `N=12`, the value is well-known:\n`E_12 = 49.165276`\n\nSubstituting `q_s = 2e`:\n`U_shell_shell = (k * (2e)^2 / R) * E_12 = (4k * e^2 / R) * E_12`\n`U_shell_shell = 4 * 49.165276 * (k * e^2 / R) = 196.661104 * (k * e^2 / R)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Minimum Energy\n\nNow, we sum the two components to find the total minimum energy:\n`U_total_min = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell_min`\n`U_total_min = (48k * e^2 / R) + (196.661104 * k * e^2 / R)`\n`U_total_min = (48 + 196.661104) * (k * e^2 / R)`\n`U_total_min = 244.661104 * (k * e^2 / R)`\n\n### 5.

    "The problem asks for the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical particles. One particle is at the center (P), and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere of radius R=2m centered at P. Each particle has a charge `q = 2e`.\n\n### 1. Breakdown of the Total Potential Energy\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of this system is the sum of all pairwise potential energies. We can group these interactions into two types:\n1.  **`U_center_shell`**: The energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the shell.\n2.  **`U_shell_shell`**: The energy from the mutual interactions among the 12 charges on the shell.\n\nThe total energy is the sum: `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`.\n\n### 2. Calculating `U_center_shell`\n\n*   The charge at the center is `q_c = 2e`.\n*   There are 12 charges on the shell, each `q_s = 2e`.\n*   The distance between the central charge and any shell charge is fixed at `R = 2 m`.\n\nThe potential energy for one pair (central charge + one shell charge) is given by Coulomb's law:\n`U_pair = (k * q_c * q_s) / R = k * (2e) * (2e) / R = 4k * e^2 / R`\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant (`≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2`) and `e` is the elementary charge (`≈ 1.602 x 10^-19 C`).\n\nSince there are 12 such identical interactions, the total energy for this part is:\n`U_center_shell = 12 * U_pair = 12 * (4k * e^2 / R) = 48 * (k * e^2 / R)`\n\nThis value is constant because the charges and distances are fixed.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Minimum `U_shell_shell`\n\nTo find the minimum total energy of the system, we need to find the configuration of the 12 shell charges that minimizes their mutual potential energy, `U_shell_shell`. This is a well-known problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor `N = 12` charges on the surface of a sphere, the minimum energy configuration occurs when the charges are positioned at the vertices of a **regular icosahedron**.\n\nThe potential energy for this configuration is typically expressed as:\n`U_shell_shell_min = E_N * (k * q^2 / R)`\nwhere `E_N` is a dimensionless constant that depends on the number of particles `N`. For `N=12`, the constant `E_12` has been calculated to be `49.165276`.\n\nIn our case, the charge of the shell particles is `q = q_s = 2e`. So, the formula becomes:\n`U_shell_shell_min = E_12 * (k * (2e)^2 / R) = E_12 * (4k * e^2 / R)`\n`U_shell_shell_min = 49.165276 * 4 * (k * e^2 / R) = 196.661104 * (k * e^2 / R)`\n\n### 4.
