    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and radioactive decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The fraction of particles, $N/N_0$, that survive after a time $t$ in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $N/N_0 = e^{-t / \\tau_{lab}}$\n    where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles, $N$ is the number of particles that have not decayed, and $\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector of radius $R = 30$ m. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their velocity $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    $t = R/v \\approx R/c$\n\n3.  **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame, $\\tau_{lab}$, is longer than their proper mean lifetime, $\\tau_0$ (the lifetime in their own rest frame), due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** By substituting the expressions for $t$ and $\\tau_{lab}$ into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles reaching the detector:\n    $N/N_0 = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)} = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = 20$, one-third ($1/3$) of the particles reach the detector. Let's use this to find the value of the constant term $R/(c\\tau_0)$, which depends on the detector size and the intrinsic properties of the particle.\n    $1/3 = e^{-R / (c \\cdot 20 \\cdot \\tau_0)}$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\ln(1/3) = -R / (20 c \\tau_0)$\n    $-\\ln(3) = -R / (20 c \\tau_0)$\n    So, the constant term is:\n    $R / (c \\tau_0) = 20 \\ln(3)$\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** Now, we want to find the new Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$, for which two-thirds ($2/3$) of the particles reach the detector.\n    $2/3 = e^{-R / (c \\gamma_2 \\tau_0)}$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\ln(2/3) = -R / (c \\gamma_2 \\tau_0)$\n    $-\\ln(3/2) = -R / (c \\gamma_2 \\tau_0)$\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{R / (c \\tau_0)}{\\ln(3/2)}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for $R/(c\\tau_0)$ that we found in step 5:\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}$\n    To get a precise numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the derivation, the formula for the new Lorentz factor is:\n# gamma2 = (gamma1 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n# where gamma1 = 20.\n\ngamma1 = 20\ngamma2 = (gamma1 * math.log(3)) / math.log(3/2)\nprint(gamma2)\n```",
    "The calculation shows that the new Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$, is approximately 54.19.\n\nHere's a recap of the steps:\n1.  The survival fraction is given by $N/N_0 = e^{-t / (\\gamma \\tau_0)}$.\n2.  The time of flight is approximately $t = R/c$.\n3.  So, $N/N_0 = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$.\n4.  For the first case, $\\gamma_1 = 20$ and $N/N_0 = 1/3$.\n    $1/3 = e^{-R / (20 c \\tau_0)}$\n    $\\ln(1/3) = -R / (20 c \\tau_0)$\n    $\\ln(3) = R / (20 c \\tau_0)$\n    This gives us the value for the constant part of the exponent: $R/(c\\tau_0) = 20 \\ln(3)$.\n5.  For the second case, we want $N/N_0 = 2/3$. We need to find $\\gamma_2$.\n    $2/3 = e^{-R / (\\gamma_2 c \\tau_0)}$\n    $\\ln(2/3) = -R / (\\gamma_2 c \\tau_0)$\n    $\\ln(3/2) = R / (\\gamma_2 c \\tau_0)$\n6.  Now we have two equations for the constant $R/(c\\tau_0)$:\n    $20 \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(3/2)$\n7.  Solving for $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = 20 \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}$\n8.  The python script calculated this value to be approximately 54.19.\n\nLooking at the multiple-choice options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe calculated value of 54.19 is very close to 54. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
