    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, as in an acetate ester (CH₃-COO-).\n        *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of an acetate group, which is common to all four possible structures.\n\n    2.  **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\n        *   These signals are in the vinylic region, indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H).\n        *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n            *   This is a single proton on the double bond.\n            *   Its splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton.\n            *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. For protons across a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) is definitive for a **trans** stereochemistry. A smaller coupling constant (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* stereochemistry. The value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a *trans* arrangement. This eliminates the *cis* isomers (A and C).\n            *   The downfield shift to 7.0 ppm is caused by the deshielding effect of the adjacent acetate oxygen.\n\n        *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n            *   This is the second proton on the double bond.\n            *   Its splitting is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant for this interaction must be the same 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The \"quartet\" part (a 1:3:3:1 pattern) arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This indicates coupling to an adjacent methyl (CH₃) group.\n\n    3.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This is a methyl group.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a double bond).\n        *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms that the methyl group is attached to the double bond at the carbon bearing the proton at 5.5 ppm (i.e., a -CH=CH-CH₃ arrangement).\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n\n    1.  We have an acetate group (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n    2.  We have a *trans* double bond (from the J = 16.0 Hz coupling).\n    3.  The double bond is part of a `-CH=CH-CH₃` fragment. The `-CH=` proton is the one at 5.5 ppm (split into a dq by the other vinylic H and the CH₃ group), and the `-CH₃` protons are at 1.6 ppm (split into a d by the adjacent vinylic H).\n    4.  This fragment is a **propenyl** group. This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (A and D), as they would have a -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃ structure, which would produce different signals (e.g., a methyl triplet).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The compound has an acetate group, a *trans* double bond, and a propenyl group. The only structure that fits all these criteria is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n          H       O-C(=O)-CH₃\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n      H₃C         H\n    ```\n    *   `CH₃-C=O`: 2.1 ppm (s)\n    *   `H` next to `O`: 7.0 ppm (d)\n    *   `H` next to `CH₃`: 5.5 ppm (dq)\n    *   `CH₃` next to `C=C`: 1.6 ppm (d)\n\nThis matches the data perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
