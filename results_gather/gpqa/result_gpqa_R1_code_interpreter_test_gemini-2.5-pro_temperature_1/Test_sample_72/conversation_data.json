    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given two astronauts with different masses and relativistic speeds, both moving in the same direction. We need to calculate two quantities:\n- The relative speed between the two astronauts.\n- The total energy of the system, which consists of both astronauts.\n\n**Given values:**\n- Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$): $2m$\n- Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$): $0.6c$\n- Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$): $3m$\n- Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$): $0.5c$\n- $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\nSince the speeds are relativistic, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2 (when they are moving in the same direction in a stationary frame) is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\nThe total energy of a single particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m_{rest}c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = (\\gamma_1 m_1 c^2) + (\\gamma_2 m_2 c^2)$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor for each astronaut.\n\n**For astronaut 1:**\n- $v_1 = 0.6c$\n- $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_1/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n- The energy of astronaut 1 is:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For astronaut 2:**\n- $v_2 = 0.5c$\n- $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n- The energy of astronaut 2 is:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Now, we find the total energy:**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n- **Calculated values:** $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n- **Option A:** $v_{rel} = 1.1c , E= mc^2$ (Incorrect)\n- **Option B:** $v_{rel}=0.14c, E=5mc^2$ (Incorrect energy)\n- **Option C:** $v_{rel} = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2$ (Matches both calculated values)\n- **Option D:** $v_{rel} =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2$ (Incorrect)\n\nTo ensure the precision of the calculation, we can use a small script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can use c=1 for simplicity and add it back at the end.\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2 # in units of m\nv1 = 0.6 # in units of c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3 # in units of m\nv2 = 0.5 # in units of c\n\n# Part 1: Relative Speed\nv_rel_num = v1 - v2\nv_rel_den = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel = v_rel_num / v_rel_den\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# Lorentz factor for 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2 / c**2)\n# Energy for 1 (in units of mc^2)\nE1_coeff = gamma1 * m1\n\n# Lorentz factor for 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2 / c**2)\n# Energy for 2 (in units of mc^2)\nE2_coeff = gamma2 * m2\n\n# Total energy (in units of mc^2)\nE_total_coeff = E1_coeff + E2_coeff\n\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Total energy: {E_total_coeff:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n>>>\nRelative speed: 0.14c\nTotal energy: 5.96mc^2\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the detailed solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nIn classical physics, we would simply subtract the speeds ($0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). However, at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ as observed from a stationary frame, the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2 is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **$0.14c$**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m_{rest}c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass ($m_1$) = $2m$\n*   Velocity ($v_1$) = $0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass ($m_2$) = $3m$\n*   Velocity ($v_2$) = $0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **$5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately $0.14c$, and the total energy of the system is approximately $5.96 mc^2$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
