    "This question asks for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive these potentials from the fundamental formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Definition of Terms\n\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   `\\vec{s}(t)`: The position vector of the charge as a function of time `t`.\n*   `\\vec{r}`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which the field is observed.\n*   `t_r`: The retarded time. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at position `\\vec{r}` at time `t`.\n*   The signal travels at the speed of light `c`. The distance the signal travels is `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`. The time taken is `t - t_r`. Therefore, the retarded time `t_r` is defined implicitly by the equation:\n    `c(t - t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`\n*   `\\vec{d}`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `t_r` to the observation point `\\vec{r}`.\n    `\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)`\n*   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `\\vec{d}`.\n    `d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|`\n    From the definition of retarded time, we have `d = c(t - t_r)`.\n*   `\\vec{v}`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time `t_r`.\n    `\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}\\bigg|_{t'=t_r}`\n*   `\\epsilon_0`: Permittivity of free space.\n*   `\\mu_0`: Permeability of free space.\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a time-varying charge distribution `\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')` and current distribution `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')` are the retarded potentials:\n\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'`\n\nwhere `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`.\n\n### 3. Potentials for a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `\\vec{s}(t)`, the charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n\n`\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n`\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))` where `\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'`.\n\nSubstituting these into the retarded potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time `t_r` in the argument of `\\rho` and `\\vec{J}` depends on the integration variable `\\vec{r}'`. A careful evaluation of the integral (often done by introducing another delta function for time and integrating over `t'` first) yields the following result:\n\nThe effective charge is modified by a kinematic factor that accounts for the fact that the volume element of the source is \"seen\" differently by the observer due to the source's motion (a Doppler-like effect). The denominator `|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|` is replaced by `[|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}')}{c|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|})]_{t_r}`.\n\nUsing the notation defined in Step 1:\n`[|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|]_{t_r} = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = d`\n`[\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}']_{t_r} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r) = \\vec{d}`\n`[\\vec{v}]_{t_r} = \\vec{v}(t_r) = \\vec{v}`\n\nThe evaluation of the integral for the scalar potential gives:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{d}/(cd))}`\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}`\n\nTo match the format in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential, the integral yields:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{d}/(cd))}`\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}`\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}`\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options\n\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**\n    This exactly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n*   **B) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**\n    The expression for `V` is the electrostatic potential, which ignores all retardation and motion effects. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)`**\n    Similar to B, this uses the incorrect static potential for `V`. Although the relation `\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V` is correct for the true Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since `\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2`), the expressions given for `V` and `A` are wrong.\n\n*   **D) `V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}`**\n    This option has a `+` sign in the denominator instead of a `-` sign. The negative sign is crucial as it describes the Doppler effect: when the charge moves towards the observer (`\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v} > 0`), the denominator decreases, and the potential increases. The `+` sign would incorrectly describe the opposite effect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct representation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
