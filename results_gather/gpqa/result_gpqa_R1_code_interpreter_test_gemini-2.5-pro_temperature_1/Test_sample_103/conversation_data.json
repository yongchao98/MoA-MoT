    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 ($P_2$) to that of planet #1 ($P_1$), i.e., $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Star masses are equal: $M_{star1} = M_{star2} = M_s$.\n    *   Planet masses are approximately equal: $M_{planet1} \\approx M_{planet2} = M_p$. We will assume they are equal for the calculation.\n    *   Orbits are circular ($e=0$).\n    *   The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The observable is the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line from the star.\n    *   The maximum shift for star 1 is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms.\n    *   The maximum shift for star 2 is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n\n3.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula relates the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) to the star's radial velocity ($v_{rad}$):\n        $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{rad}}{c}$\n    *   The *amplitude* of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    *   Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We can establish the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (P):**\n    *   A star and a planet orbit their common center of mass. For a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude is given by $K = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $v_{star}$ is the star's orbital speed and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit. We can assume the inclination factor $\\sin(i)$ is the same for both systems and it will cancel out.\n    *   The star's orbital speed is $v_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi r_s}{P}$, where $r_s$ is the radius of the star's orbit around the center of mass.\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass: $M_s r_s = M_p r_p$, where $a = r_s + r_p$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   Since planet masses are much smaller than star masses ($M_p \\ll M_s$), we can approximate $r_s \\approx a \\frac{M_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the velocity equation: $K \\propto v_{star} = \\frac{2\\pi}{P} \\left(a \\frac{M_p}{M_s}\\right)$. So, $K \\propto \\frac{a M_p}{P M_s}$.\n\n5.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states: $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + M_p)} a^3$.\n    *   Again, since $M_p \\ll M_s$, we can approximate this as $P^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_s} a^3$.\n    *   Since $M_s$ is the same for both stars, we have the relationship $P^2 \\propto a^3$, which means $a \\propto P^{2/3}$.\n\n6.  **Combine the Equations to Find the Final Relationship:**\n    *   We have $K \\propto \\frac{a M_p}{P M_s}$.\n    *   Since $M_p$ and $M_s$ are the same for both systems, they are constants in this proportionality: $K \\propto \\frac{a}{P}$.\n    *   Now substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law ($a \\propto P^{2/3}$):\n        $K \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{2/3 - 1} = P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   This gives us the key relationship: $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    *   From the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find $P_2/P_1$. Let's rearrange the formula:\n        $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n    *   Now, substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get a numerical answer, we calculate $(5/7)^3$. I will use a simple python script for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1 is given by (K1/K2)^3.\n# The ratio of the velocity amplitudes K1/K2 is given by the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5.0\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7.0\n\n# Calculate the ratio of velocity amplitudes\nK_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nP_ratio = K_ratio**3\n\nprint(P_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.364431487-10\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that $(5/7)^3 \\approx 0.3644$.\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1.96\n    *   B) ~ 1.40\n    *   C) ~ 0.36\n    *   D) ~ 0.85\n    The calculated value of ~0.3644 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity method measures the wobble of a star caused by an orbiting planet. The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_{rad}$) along the line of sight, according to the Doppler effect formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{rad}}{c}$. The maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the amplitude of the velocity curve, denoted as $K$. Therefore, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Velocity Amplitudes:** From the problem statement, we are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two stars:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n    The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Relating Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** The velocity amplitude ($K$) of a star in a circular orbit can be expressed as:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s + M_p} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_s + M_p)}{a}}$\n    Where $M_s$ is the star mass, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n    Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star mass ($M_p \\ll M_s$), we can simplify this to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_s} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_s}{a}}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\sqrt{a}}$\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$ (again, assuming $M_p \\ll M_s$).\n    This means $a^3 \\propto P^2 M_s$, so $a \\propto (P^2 M_s)^{1/3}$.\n    Substituting this into our expression for $K$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\sqrt{(P^2 M_s)^{1/3}}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s \\cdot (P^2 M_s)^{1/6}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s^{1+1/6} \\cdot P^{2/6}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_s^{7/6} \\cdot P^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Finding the Period Ratio:** The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). We also assume the inclinations are statistically similar and cancel out. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n    We can now write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculation:** Substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\approx (0.714)^3 \\approx 0.364$\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
