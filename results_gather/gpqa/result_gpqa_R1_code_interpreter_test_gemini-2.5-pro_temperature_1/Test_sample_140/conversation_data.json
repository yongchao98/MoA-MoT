    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and its isotope, deuterium (D), at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻), being a strong base, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the ortho positions to the bromine at C1 are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of a proton (H) from C6.**\n        *   The base NH₂⁻ removes the hydrogen atom from C6. This is generally a fast process.\n        *   This creates a carbanion at C6. The negative charge then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n        *   The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (If we number the benzyne triple bond as C1-C6, the deuterium is at position 2 of the original ring, which is position 3 relative to the new C1 of the benzyne).\n\n        ```\n        Br           H                (intermediate)\n        |           /                ___\n       (C1)---(C2)D      (C6)         (C1)===(C6)\n       //     \\\\   + NH2- -> -HBr ->   //     \\\n      (C6)H---(C3)H                    (C2)D---(C5)H\n       \\      /                      \\      /\n        (C5)---(C4)                     (C3)---(C4)\n        ```\n        *(This intermediate is 3-deuterobenzyne)*\n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2.**\n        *   The C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, this path is slower than Path A, but it is still a *possible* reaction pathway.\n        *   The base NH₂⁻ removes the deuterium atom from C2.\n        *   This creates a carbanion at C2, which then expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the ring.\n        *   The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n        ```\n        Br           D                (intermediate)\n        |           /                ___\n       (C1)---(C2)       (C2)         (C1)===(C2)\n       //     \\\\   + NH2- -> -DBr ->   //     \\\\\n      (C6)H---(C3)H                    (C6)H---(C3)H\n       \\      /                      \\      /\n        (C5)---(C4)                     (C5)---(C4)\n        ```\n        *(This intermediate is benzyne)*\n\n    So, two different benzyne intermediates are possibly formed.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Attack by Nucleophile)**\n    The nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH₂⁻), attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6. These two carbons are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion forms at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline** (or o-deuterioaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion forms at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the D at C2. The relationship between the -NH₂ and D is 1,3 (meta). This is **3-deuterioaniline** (or m-deuterioaniline).\n        *   So, Path A leads to two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Attack on benzyne (from Path B):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C2. These two positions are equivalent.\n        *   Attack at either carbon, followed by protonation from the solvent NH₃, yields **aniline**. Since the deuterium was removed during the formation of this intermediate, the final product is not deuterated.\n        *   So, Path B leads to one product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Possible Products**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we identify the set of all possible organic products:\n    1.  Aniline (from Path B)\n    2.  2-Deuterioaniline (from Path A)\n    3.  3-Deuterioaniline (from Path A)\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
