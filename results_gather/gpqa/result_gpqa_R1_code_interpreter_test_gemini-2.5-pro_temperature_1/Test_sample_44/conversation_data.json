    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A key property of fermions is that they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the spatial wavefunction and energy.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions.\n\n### **2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nThe problem defines a base unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nLet's list the first few single-particle energy levels:\n*   For n=1, $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   For n=2, $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   For n=3, $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   For n=4, $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n... and so on.\n\nEach of these levels can accommodate up to two particles.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to find the total energy of the system of four particles for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n#### **Ground State (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we must fill the available energy levels from the bottom up.\n\n1.  **Level n=1 (Energy 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy from these two particles = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n2.  **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We have two more particles to place. We put them in the next lowest available level, n=2.\n    *   Energy from these two particles = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n#### **First Excited State (E_1st_excited)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. We can find this by taking the ground state configuration and promoting one particle to the next available energy level in the way that requires the least energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest Energy Excitation:** The least energy is required to promote a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **New Configuration:** We move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **Level n=1:** Still holds two particles. Energy = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 * (4E) = 4E.\n    *   **Level n=3:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 * (9E) = 9E.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is the sum:\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n#### **Second Excited State (E_2nd_excited)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy cost.\n\nLet's list the possible next-lowest energy configurations (excitations from the ground state):\n*   **Excitation A (already found for 1st excited state):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy: 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 15E.\n*   **Excitation B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. (This costs more energy than A, as the jump from n=1 to n=3 is larger than n=2 to n=3).\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy: 1*(1E) + 2*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Excitation C:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy: 2*(1E) + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy: 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nListing the total energies of these configurations in increasing order:\n1.  10E (Ground State)\n2.  15E (from Excitation A)\n3.  18E (from Excitation B)\n4.  20E (from Excitation C)\n5.  22E (from Excitation D)\n\nThe state with the third-lowest energy is 18E. Therefore:\n$E_{2nd\\_excited} = 18E$.\n\n### **4. Final Answer**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_system_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and\n    second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D\n    infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_particles = 4\n    # Each energy level n can hold 2 particles (spin up, spin down).\n    # We create a list of single-particle energy states available.\n    # Energy of state n is n^2.

    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1. Fundamental Concepts**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey this principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States in a 1D Well:** A particle's state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (n=1, 2, 3, ...) and its spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (spin-up ↑, or spin-down ↓).\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Using the problem's definition of $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, the energy levels are:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Total System Energies**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the four particles.\n\n#### **Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy 1E):** Place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed: 2 × 1E = 2E\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** Place the remaining two particles here.\n    *   Energy contributed: 2 × 4E = 8E\n\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### **First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest total energy. This is achieved by the lowest-energy promotion of a single particle from the ground state configuration. We move one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   **Level n=1:** Still contains two particles.\n    *   Energy contributed: 2 × 1E = 2E\n*   **Level n=2:** Now contains one particle.\n    *   Energy contributed: 1 × 4E = 4E\n*   **Level n=3:** Now contains one particle.\n    *   Energy contributed: 1 × 9E = 9E\n\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. We must consider the next possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Excitation 1 (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total energy = 15E.\n*   **Excitation 2:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. This is a higher energy jump than the first excitation.\n    *   **Configuration:** One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   **Total Energy:** $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Other Excitations:** Other possibilities, like promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 (Total Energy = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E) or promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3 (Total Energy = 2E + 18E = 20E), result in higher energies.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible states:\n1.  Ground State: 10E\n2.  First Excited State: 15E\n3.  Second Excited State: 18E\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
