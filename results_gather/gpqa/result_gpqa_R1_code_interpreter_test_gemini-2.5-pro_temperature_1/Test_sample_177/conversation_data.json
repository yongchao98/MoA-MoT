    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory defined by the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n### **1. Dimensional Analysis in Natural Units**\n\nIn natural units, we set the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$ to 1 ($\\hbar=c=1$). In this system, mass, energy, and momentum all have the same dimension, which we will denote as $[M]$. Length and time have the inverse dimension, $[M^{-1}]$.\n\nThe action, $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$, must be a dimensionless quantity. The four-dimensional volume element $d^4x$ has dimensions of $[length]^4$, which corresponds to a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = [M^{-4}]$. For the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4.\n*   $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$\n\n### **2. Mass Dimension of the Fields**\n\nWe can determine the mass dimensions of the fields by examining their kinetic terms in the free Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field ($\\psi$)**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fermion}} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. The dimension of this term must be 4. Let's analyze the derivative part, $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has the dimension of inverse length, so $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   The fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ have the same mass dimension, i.e., $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M$.\n    \n    The mass dimension of the term must be 4:\n    $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M [\\gamma^\\mu]_M [\\partial_\\mu]_M [\\psi]_M = 4$\n    $[\\psi]_M \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1 \\cdot [\\psi]_M = 4$  (Here we mean the sum of the exponents of M)\n    $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$\n    $2[\\psi]_M = 3 \\implies [\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{EM}} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be 4.\n    \n    $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n    $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4 \\implies [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$.\n    *   Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n    *   $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n### **3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ from the given interaction Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. The mass dimension of this term must also be 4.\n\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### **4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by a method called \"power-counting,\" which relies on the mass dimension of the coupling constants of the interaction terms. For a theory in 4 spacetime dimensions:\n\n*   **Renormalizable:** If all coupling constants have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero ($[g]_M \\ge 0$).\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension ($[g]_M < 0$).\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. Because the dimension is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nIn perturbation theory, a negative mass dimension for a coupling constant means that loop diagrams will generate divergences that are more severe at higher orders. To cancel these divergences, one would need to introduce an infinite number of new counterterms, making the theory lose its predictive power at high energies. Such theories are considered effective field theories, valid only up to a certain energy scale.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
