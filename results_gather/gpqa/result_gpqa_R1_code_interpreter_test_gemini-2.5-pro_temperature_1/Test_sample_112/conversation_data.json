    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded group. The significant broadness is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Alcohols also show O-H stretches, but they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n    *Conclusion from FTIR:* The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates an **alkene** functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for **vinyl-hydrogens** (protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond) confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is a key piece of evidence. This mass corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Atomic mass of C=12, O=16, H=1; so, 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides strong confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule that contains both a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and an **alkene** (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with B (C₆H₁₂O₂) and C (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require:\n        *   One pi bond for the C=O in the carboxylic acid (1 DoU).\n        *   One pi bond for the C=C of the alkene (1 DoU).\n        *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For B (C₆H₁₂O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        *   **For C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n\n    *   Only formula C₆H₁₀O₂ has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which is required to accommodate both the carboxylic acid and the alkene functional groups identified from the spectra. Formula C₆H₁₂O₂ only has enough unsaturation for the carboxylic acid group *or* an alkene, but not both.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula)\n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\n# Data from the problem\nrequired_dou = 1  # for C=O in carboxylic acid\nrequired_dou += 1 # for C=C in alkene\nrequires_two_oxygens = True\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O\"\n}\n\nprint(f\"Analysis based on spectral data:\")\nprint(f\" - Presence of Carboxylic Acid (-COOH) confirmed by FTIR and MS (m/z=45).\")\nprint(f\" - Presence of Alkene (C=C) confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR.\")\nprint(f\"This requires the molecule to have 2 oxygen atoms and a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2 (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Evaluating options:\")\n\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    num_oxygens = int(formula.split('O')[1]) if 'O' in formula else 0\n    if num_oxygens == 1:\n        num_oxygens = 1 # handle case where O has no number after it\n        \n    match_dou = (dou == required_dou)\n    match_oxygens = (num_oxygens == 2)\n    \n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}):\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of Oxygens: {num_oxygens}.

    "My apologies, the previous code had a bug when parsing the number of oxygen atoms for formulas like C6H10O where the number '1' is implicit. Here is the corrected reasoning and code.\n\n**Reasoning Correction:**\n\nThe initial reasoning process for identifying the correct compound remains valid. The error was purely in the implementation of the Python script designed to automate and verify this reasoning. The script failed when trying to convert an empty string to an integer for formulas with a single oxygen atom.\n\nLet's re-summarize the chemical logic:\n1.  **FTIR:** A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and another at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH) and an **alkene** (C=C).\n2.  **¹H NMR:** Peaks for vinyl hydrogens confirm the **alkene** (C=C).\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:** A fragment at m/z = 45 strongly suggests the [COOH]⁺ fragment, confirming the **carboxylic acid**.\n4.  **Structure Requirements:** The molecule must contain two oxygen atoms (for the -COOH group) and have a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2 (one for the C=O bond, one for the C=C bond).\n5.  **Evaluating Options:**\n    *   C6H12O (1 O, DoU=1) -> Incorrect.\n    *   C6H12O2 (2 O, DoU=1) -> Incorrect. Does not have enough unsaturation for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n    *   C6H10O2 (2 O, DoU=2) -> Correct. Matches both the oxygen count and the required degree of unsaturation.\n    *   C6H10O (1 O, DoU=2) -> Incorrect.\n\nThe following corrected script properly parses the chemical formulas and arrives at the same conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula)\n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\ndef count_oxygens(formula):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of oxygen atoms in a chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    o_match = re.search(r'O(\\d*)', formula)\n    if not o_match:\n        return 0\n    # If a number is after 'O' (e.g., 'O2'), convert it to int.\n    # If no number is after 'O' (e.g., 'C6H12O'), it's 1.\n    count_str = o_match.group(1)\n    return int(count_str) if count_str else 1\n\n# Data from the problem\nrequired_dou = 2  # 1 for C=O in carboxylic acid + 1 for C=C in alkene\nrequired_oxygens = 2 # for carboxylic acid\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformulas = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Analysis based on spectral data:\")\nprint(\"- Presence of Carboxylic Acid (-COOH) and Alkene (C=C) functional groups identified.\")\nprint(f\"- This requires the molecule to have {required_oxygens} oxygen atoms and a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of {required_dou}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Evaluating options:\")\n\nfor option, formula in formulas.items():\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    num_oxygens = count_oxygens(formula)\n    \n    match_dou = (dou == required_dou)\n    match_oxygens = (num_oxygens == required_oxygens)\n    \n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}):\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of Oxygens: {num_oxygens}.

    "The analysis is complete. The combination of FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, along with the calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation, definitively identifies the correct molecular formula.\n\n1.  **Functional Group Identification:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates an alkene (C=C).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the alkene (C=C).\n    *   **Mass Spec:** The fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n\n2.  **Structural Requirements:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid requires **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n    *   The molecule must contain at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the carbonyl group (C=O) and one for the alkene (C=C).\n\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   **Option B (C₆H₁₂O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This is not enough to have both a carbonyl and an alkene.\n    *   **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This perfectly matches the requirement for one carbonyl and one alkene.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
