    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity.** In this physical system, the total energy is conserved. The total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\n2.  **Write down the expression for total energy.**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    *   The potential energy of a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system at any point in its motion is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy principle.** The total energy must be the same at all points during the oscillation. We can find the value of this constant total energy by considering a point where the variables are known. A convenient point is the maximum amplitude, $x=A$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total energy at maximum amplitude ($x=A$).**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy is therefore:\n        $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).**\n    *   At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The speed of the mass is at its maximum value, which we denote as $v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor will be at its maximum value: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    *   Since energy is conserved, the total energy at $x=A$ is equal to the total energy at $x=0$:\n        $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n    *   Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Now substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   To solve for $v_{max}$, first invert both sides of the equation:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
