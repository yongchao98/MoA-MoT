    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_1`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M_2`). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (`M_total = m_a + m_b`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Key Information:** Both systems are eclipsing binaries. This implies the inclination angle `i` of the orbital plane to the line of sight is approximately 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The radial velocity variations are sinusoidal, which suggests the orbits are approximately circular.\n\n3.  **Find the Relevant Physical Formula:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (`M_total = m_1 + m_2`) can be determined using Kepler's Third Law combined with the observed radial velocities. The formula is:\n    `M_total = (P * (K_1 + K_2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))`\n    Where:\n    *   `M_total` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K_1` and `K_2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination angle.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `M_1 / M_2`.\n    `M_1 / M_2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The term `2 * π * G` is a constant and cancels out. Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `sin(i_1) ≈ 1` and `sin(i_2) ≈ 1`, so these terms also cancel out. The simplified ratio is:\n    `M_1 / M_2 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Calculate:** Now, we plug in the given values into the simplified formula. The units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are consistent between the two systems, so they will cancel out in the ratio, and no conversion to SI units is necessary.\n\n    *   For System 1: `K1_sum = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   For System 2: `K2_sum = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n    `M_1 / M_2 = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n    `M_1 / M_2 = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n    `M_1 / M_2 = 6750 / 15625`\n\n    To simplify the fraction:\n    `M_1 / M_2 = 2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * (27/125) = 54 / 125`\n\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    `M_1 / M_2 = 0.432`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is `0.432`. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.6\n    B) ~ 1.2\n    C) ~ 0.7\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\n    The value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0 # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # years\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_sum = K1a + K1b\nK2_sum = K2a + K2b\n\n# The total mass M is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3.\n# We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K1_sum)**3) / (P2 * (K2_sum)**3)\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\n\nThe code confirms the calculation. The ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 is 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, `M_1 / M_2`.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where spectral lines from both stars are visible and shifting), the total mass of the system (`M = m_1 + m_2`) can be determined from the orbital period (`P`) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (`K_1` and `K_2`).\n\n2.  **State the formula:** The relationship derived from Kepler's Third Law for a binary system is:\n    `M_1 + M_2 = (P * (K_1 + K_2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))`\n    where:\n    *   `M_1 + M_2` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K_1` and `K_2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to the two systems:**\n    *   For system_1: `M_1_total = (P_1 * (K_{1a} + K_{1b})^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_1))`\n    *   For system_2: `M_2_total = (P_2 * (K_{2a} + K_{2b})^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_2))`\n\n4.  **Form the ratio:** We want to find `M_1_total / M_2_total`.\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = [ (P_1 * (K_{1a} + K_{1b})^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_1)) ] / [ (P_2 * (K_{2a} + K_{2b})^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i_2)) ]`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   The constant term `2 * π * G` cancels out from the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   The problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. For an eclipse to occur, the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90°. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. We can assume this for both systems, so `sin^3(i_1)` and `sin^3(i_2)` are both approximately 1 and cancel out.\n    *   The simplified ratio becomes:\n        `M_1_total / M_2_total = (P_1 * (K_{1a} + K_{1b})^3) / (P_2 * (K_{2a} + K_{2b})^3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    *   **System 1:** `P_1 = 2` years, `K_{1a} = 10` km/s, `K_{1b} = 5` km/s.\n        `K_{1a} + K_{1b} = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s.\n    *   **System 2:** `P_2 = 1` year, `K_{2a} = 15` km/s, `K_{2b} = 10` km/s.\n        `K_{2a} + K_{2b} = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final ratio:**\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)`\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = 6750 / 15625`\n    `M_1_total / M_2_total = 0.432`\n\nThe calculation was confirmed using the provided python script, which returned `0.432`.\n\n8.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value `0.432` is closest to the option `0.4`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
