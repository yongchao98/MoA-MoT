    "Answering this question requires understanding the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in a hydrogen atom and calculating the branching ratios for the possible decay paths.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Transition Route\n\nThe atom transitions from the initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ via two dipole transitions. This implies the existence of an intermediate state, let's call it $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$.\n\nThe selection rules for an electric dipole (E1) transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in $l$**: The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l_i = 1$.\n*   **Change in $m$**: The initial state has $m=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, the intermediate state can have $m_i = 0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in $n$**: For a decay (emission) process, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease. Since the final state is $n=1$, the intermediate state must have $n_i=2$. A transition from $n=3$ to $n=1$ directly is forbidden by the $\\Delta l$ rule.\n*   **Intermediate States**: Combining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2, 1, m_i\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if transitions from our identified intermediate states to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Change in $l$**: The initial (intermediate) state has $l_i=1$, and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Change in $m$**: The final state has $m_f=0$. The initial (intermediate) state can have $m_i = -1, 0, 1$. The change is $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = -m_i$. In all cases (for $m_i = -1, 0, 1$), $\\Delta m$ will be $1, 0,$ or $-1$, which is allowed.\n\nSo, all three possible routes are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nThe options presented in the question (A, B, C) all list one of these valid routes. To find the correct answer, we must calculate the probability of these routes.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific transition route in a cascade process refers to the branching ratio of the first step. This is because once the atom reaches one of the intermediate $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ states, it has only one allowed dipole transition to a lower energy state, which is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the probability of the second step, given the first has occurred, is 1.\n\nThe branching ratio for the decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m_i\\rangle$ is:\n$P(m_i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_i\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)}$\nwhere $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is the transition rate from state $i$ to state $f$.\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 |\\langle f | \\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\n\nWe need to compare the rates $\\Gamma$ for the three possible values of $m_i (-1, 0, 1)$.\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). When an unpolarized atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the sublevels of the final state are populated equally.\n\nLet's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n$|\\langle 2,1,m_i | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,m_i | x | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_i | y | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle 2,1,m_i | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nUsing the properties of spherical harmonics, one can show that:\n*   The matrix element of $z$ ($z=r\\cos\\theta \\propto Y_{1,0}$) is non-zero only for transitions where $\\Delta m = 0$. So, it only contributes to the decay to $|2,1,0\\rangle$.\n*   The matrix elements of $x$ and $y$ (which are linear combinations of $r Y_{1,1}$ and $r Y_{1,-1}$) are non-zero only for transitions where $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$. They contribute to the decays to $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\nA detailed calculation of the integrals shows that the total transition probability, summed over all polarizations, is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m_i$:\n$|\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nSince the energy difference $\\Delta E = E_{3s} - E_{2p}$ is the same for all three transitions, the transition rates are equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$\n\nLet this rate be $\\Gamma_0$. The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1\\rangle$ manifold is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for any one of these specific paths is:\n$P = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nEach of the three possible decay routes has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Now we check the given options:\n\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. Both the route and the probability are correct.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nD) ...$\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
