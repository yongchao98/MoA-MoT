    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Deduce Structural Fragments:**\n\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This group contains a carbonyl (`C=O`), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring, a para (1,4) substitution pattern typically gives two signals for the four aromatic protons due to symmetry (an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two doublets). Ortho and meta substitution would likely result in more complex patterns or up to four distinct signals. Therefore, we can assume a **para-substituted benzene ring (p-C6H4)**. This accounts for 4 hydrogens and 6 carbons.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very characteristic pattern. A vinyl proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq) must be coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and three equivalent protons, i.e., a methyl group (giving the quartet). The other vinyl proton, being a doublet (d), is coupled to just the first vinyl proton. This pattern unambiguously identifies a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**. This fragment accounts for one `-CH3` group and the two vinyl protons.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have already identified one `-CH3` group in the propenyl fragment. The second `-CH3` group must belong to the ester functionality, for example, as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OOCCH3`).\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl esters or longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments into Possible Structures:**\n\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A para-phenylene group (`-C6H4-`)\n    *   A propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   An ester group (`-COO-`)\n    *   A methyl group (`-CH3`)\n\n    The two substituents on the para-phenylene ring must be the propenyl group and the ester/methyl combination. This leads to two possible isomers:\n\n    *   **Isomer A:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate\n        *   The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-COOCH3`.\n    *   **Isomer B:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate\n        *   The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-O-CO-CH3`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\n    Let's calculate the chemical formula for these proposed structures.\n    *   **For Isomer A:** C (from propenyl) + C (from ring) + C (from methyl ester) = 3 + 6 + 2 = **11 Carbons**. H (from propenyl) + H (from ring) + H (from methyl ester) = 5 + 4 + 3 = **12 Hydrogens**. O (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**. The formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    *   **For Isomer B:** C (from propenyl) + C (from ring) + C (from acetate) = 3 + 6 + 2 = **11 Carbons**. H (from propenyl) + H (from ring) + H (from acetate) = 5 + 4 + 3 = **12 Hydrogens**. O (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**. The formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    Both structures that perfectly fit the spectroscopic data have the formula **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) and Eliminate Other Options:**\n\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for the deduced structure is: 1 (for the benzene ring) + 3 (for the pi bonds in the ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C) + 1 (for the ester C=O) = 6. Let's calculate the DBE for each given formula option to see which one matches.\n\n    DBE formula: `DBE = C + 1 - H/2`\n\n    I will use a short Python script to perform these calculations.\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a C,H,O formula.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c = int(re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str).group(1))\n    h = int(re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str).group(1))\n    dbe = c + 1 - (h / 2)\n    return int(dbe)\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C11H14O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C12H14O2\"\n}\n\n# Expected DBE from deduced structure: benzene ring (4) + C=C (1) + C=O (1) = 6\nprint(f\"Expected DBE based on spectral data: 6\\n\")\n\nfor label, formula in options.items():\n    dbe = calculate_dbe(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {label}) Formula: {formula}, DBE = {dbe}\")\n\n```\nExpected DBE based on spectral data: 6\n\nOption A) Formula: C12H12O2, DBE = 7\nOption B) Formula: C11H12O2, DBE = 6\nOption C) Formula: C11H14O2, DBE = 5\nOption D) Formula: C12H14O2, DBE = 6\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DBE = 7. This is higher than the expected 6, suggesting an additional ring or pi-bond that is not supported by the NMR data.\n*   **B) C11H12O2:** DBE = 6. This perfectly matches the expected DBE for a structure containing a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond. This is our identified formula.\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 5. This DBE is too low. It implies the absence of the C=C bond, which contradicts the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 6. While the DBE matches, getting to this formula from our base structure (C11H12O2) requires adding a `CH2` group. The presence of a `CH2` group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. For example, ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate has this formula but contains a `-CH2-` group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data, the only chemical formula that is consistent with all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Based on the spectroscopic data provided, we can deduce the structure of the unknown compound step-by-step to determine its chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring & two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its four protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern due to symmetry. This fragment is `-C6H4-`.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is only split by the first one, giving a doublet (d).\n    *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (`-COOCH2CH3`) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   The spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (`-COO-`). Combined with the NMR data, this ester group must involve the second methyl group, suggesting either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-O-CO-CH3`) functionality.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A para-phenylene group: `-C6H4-`\n    *   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group: Either `-COOCH3` or `-O-CO-CH3`\n\n    Let's assemble these on the para-substituted benzene ring. A plausible structure is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate:\n    `CH3-CH=CH-` (propenyl) attached to a `C6H4` ring, which is also attached to `-COOCH3` (methyl ester).\n\n4.  **Determine the Chemical Formula from the Deduced Structure:**\n    Let's count the atoms in the proposed structure (methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate):\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH3) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from -OCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE confirms the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   From the structure: 1 (ring) + 3 (pi bonds in ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = **DBE of 6**.\n    *   From the options:\n        *   A) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n        *   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6  **(Matches)**\n        *   C) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    Both B and D have the correct DBE. However, to get from C11H12O2 (our deduced structure) to C12H14O2, one would need to add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are **no signals for –CH2 groups**, which rules out option D.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
