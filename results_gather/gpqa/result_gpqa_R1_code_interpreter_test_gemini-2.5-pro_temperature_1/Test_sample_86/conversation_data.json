    "*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and basic structure.**\n    *   The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n    *   It is di-substituted, meaning two hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced by other groups. This gives a C6H4 core.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen atom directly attached to the benzene ring).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the two substituents.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain the carbonyl group and both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms. The most plausible functional group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The general structure is X-C6H4-C(=O)CH3.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) from the 1H NMR data.**\n    *   The aromatic region of a 1H NMR spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) is very informative about the substitution pattern on a benzene ring.\n    *   Let's look at the aromatic signals in the given options:\n        *   A) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   B) 6.9 (1H, s) (signals at 4.6-4.8 are not aromatic)\n        *   C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)\n        *   D) No aromatic signals.\n    *   A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature for a **para (1,4) di-substituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer makes the two protons ortho to the first substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the second substituent equivalent. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by its single, non-equivalent neighbor.\n    *   Therefore, the compound must be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the options.**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n              O\n              ||\n              C-CH3\n              |\n          /¯¯¯\\_/¯¯¯\\\n         |     |     |\n         \\___/¯\\___/\n              |\n              X (Halogen)\n        ```\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** As determined in Step 3, there will be two doublets, representing a total of 4 protons. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the two protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm). The halogen is also electron-withdrawing, so the two protons ortho to it will also be downfield. We expect two signals in the ~7.5-8.0 ppm range.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The compound has a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the carbonyl carbon. These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for protons of a methyl ketone (R-C(=O)CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given options against the prediction.**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This perfectly matches the expected pattern for the 4 aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons in the expected chemical shift range for a methyl ketone.\n        *   This option is a perfect match for the structure of para-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Incorrect number of aromatic protons and incorrect splitting. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too far upfield for a typical aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone.\n        *   The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` does not match the expected methyl singlet. This option describes a different compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is the only choice that is fully consistent with all the information provided for a di-substituted C8 aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n<<<A>>>"
