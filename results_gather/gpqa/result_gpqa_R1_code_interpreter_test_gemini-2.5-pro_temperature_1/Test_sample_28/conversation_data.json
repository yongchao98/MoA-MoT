    "An effective way to eliminate an unwanted compound synthesized by a gene is to render the gene's protein product non-functional. The most reliable way to achieve this is through a mutation that causes the premature termination of protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the provided gene sequences and the effect of each mutation. The process of protein synthesis, called translation, reads the messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence in groups of three nucleotides, known as codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid, except for special \"stop\" codons that terminate the process. The process begins at a \"start\" codon, which is `ATG` in the DNA sequence.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis**\n\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   **Protein start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis**\n\nWe will now translate the beginning of each mutant sequence to see how the mutation affects the resulting protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Translation:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly...\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. The original third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This changes one amino acid in the protein chain. While this might affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein might still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The original third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will cause the ribosome to stop translation, producing a protein that is only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). Such a severely truncated protein will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Translation:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...\n    *   **Effect:** This sequence contains multiple changes compared to the original, resulting in two **missense mutations** near the start of the protein (Leucine to Tyrosine and Threonine to Valine). Similar to Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence but does not guarantee the complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   **Translation:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr-Ser...\n    *   **Effect:** This sequence also contains multiple changes, resulting in several **missense mutations**. Like mutants 1 and 3, it is not certain to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four mutants, Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon right at the beginning of the gene. This nonsense mutation will lead to the production of a very short, non-functional peptide, thereby reliably eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The missense mutations in the other mutants only change one or more amino acids, the effect of which is far less certain. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    genetic_code = {\n        'TTT': 'F', 'TTC': 'F', 'TTA': 'L', 'TTG': 'L',\n        'TCT': 'S', 'TCC': 'S', 'TCA': 'S', 'TCG': 'S',\n        'TAT': 'Y', 'TAC': 'Y', 'TAA': '*', 'TAG': '*',\n        'TGT': 'C', 'TGC': 'C', 'TGA': '*', 'TGG': 'W',\n        'CTT': 'L', 'CTC': 'L', 'CTA': 'L', 'CTG': 'L',\n        'CCT': 'P', 'CCC': 'P', 'CCA': 'P', 'CCG': 'P',\n        'CAT': 'H', 'CAC': 'H', 'CAA': 'Q', 'CAG': 'Q',\n        'CGT': 'R', 'CGC': 'R', 'CGA': 'R', 'CGG': 'R',\n        'ATT': 'I', 'ATC': 'I', 'ATA': 'I', 'ATG': 'M',\n        'ACT': 'T', 'ACC': 'T', 'ACA': 'T', 'ACG': 'T',\n        'AAT': 'N', 'AAC': 'N', 'AAA': 'K', 'AAG': 'K',\n        'AGT': 'S', 'AGC': 'S', 'AGA': 'R', 'AGG': 'R',\n        'GTT': 'V', 'GTC': 'V', 'GTA': 'V', 'GTG': 'V',\n        'GCT': 'A', 'GCC': 'A', 'GCA': 'A', 'GCG': 'A',\n        'GAT': 'D', 'GAC': 'D', 'GAA': 'E', 'GAG': 'E',\n        'GGT': 'G', 'GGC': 'G', 'GGA': 'G', 'GGG': 'G',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Process only the part of the sequence that is a multiple of 3\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_seq) - (len(dna_seq) % 3), 3):\n        codon = dna_seq[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codons\n        protein += amino_acid\n        if amino_acid == '*': # Stop codon\n            break\n    return protein\n\n# DNA sequences from the problem, truncated for clarity\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT\"\nmutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT\"\nmutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACA\"\nmutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT\"\n\nprint(f\"Intact Gene: {intact_gene[:30]}... -> Protein: {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1:    {mutant_1[:30]}... -> Protein: {translate_dna(mutant_1)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2:    {mutant_2[:30]}... -> Protein: {translate_dna(mutant_2)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 3:    {mutant_3[:30]}... -> Protein: {translate_dna(mutant_3)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 4:    {mutant_4[:30]}... -> Protein: {translate_dna(mutant_4)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\nprint(\"Mutant 1 introduces a missense mutation (L -> Y).\")\nprint(\"Mutant 2 introduces a nonsense (STOP) mutation, truncating the protein.\")\nprint(\"Mutant 3 introduces missense mutations (L->Y, T->V).\")\nprint(\"Mutant 4 introduces missense mutations (L->Y, G->T, T->S).\")\nprint(\"Conclusion: The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate protein function.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we must determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably created by a mutation that causes the premature termination of its synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic code. Protein synthesis, or translation, starts at the `ATG` codon (which codes for Methionine) and reads the sequence in triplets called codons. Let's examine the original gene and each mutant by breaking them into codons and determining the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n    *   This sequence produces the full, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**2. Mutant 1 Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n*   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein chain. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be functional.\n\n**3. Mutant 2 Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**, which signals the end of translation. This mutation will cause protein synthesis to stop prematurely, producing a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**4. Mutant 3 Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** ...\n*   **Effect:** These are two **missense mutations**. Like in Mutant 1, changing amino acids does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**5. Mutant 4 Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - **Thr** - Ser ...\n*   **Effect:** This also results in multiple **missense mutations**, which are not as certain to abolish protein function as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene's coding sequence. This will lead to a severely truncated, non-functional protein, thus effectively eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutations are missense mutations, which only change amino acids and are less likely to completely abolish the protein's function.\n\n<<<A>>>"
