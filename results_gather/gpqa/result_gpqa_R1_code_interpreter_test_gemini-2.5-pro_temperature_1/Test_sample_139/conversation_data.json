    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests the presence of isotopes like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, ¹⁸O, etc., instead of their lighter, more common counterparts.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and its analog are used in organic chemistry.** This points towards a common reagent. Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are prime suspects. The deuterated versions (LiAlD₄, NaBD₄) are used for isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X with a keto acid.** A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. The product having only 2 oxygen atoms implies a reduction reaction where both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups are reduced to alcohols. LiAlH₄ (and its analog LiAlD₄) is strong enough to perform this double reduction, yielding a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This strongly supports X being LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 4: Melting point of B is ~277 K.** 277 Kelvin is approximately 3.85°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match. Thus, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 5: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n        *   Since G releases D₂O upon heating, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, analogous to a metal hydroxide that releases H₂O upon heating (e.g., 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O). So, G is likely Al(OD)₃.\n        *   This implies the reaction involves Aluminium and Deuterium. This further strengthens the case for X = LiAlD₄.\n        *   The violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is well-known. A similar violent reaction would occur between LiAlD₄ and a deuterated water source. Let's assume liquid **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   Let's write the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Clue 6: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons.** Let's check our proposed gas W, which is D₂.\n        *   Deuterium (D) is an isotope of Hydrogen (¹H) with 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A D₂ molecule contains (1+1) = 2 protons and (1+1) = 2 neutrons.\n        *   The number of protons and neutrons are equal. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    All clues converge to identify Substance X as **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   The question requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H) has a mass number of 2.\n        *   The most common and stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms:** There are four atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** There is one atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative (summed) mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Total mass of D atoms) + (Total mass of Al atoms) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Check:**\n    The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
