    "This problem requires the systematic application of IUPAC nomenclature rules for substituted benzene derivatives.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Molecule:**\n    The highest priority functional group given is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned locant number 1 (C1).\n\n2.  **Identify all Substituents:**\n    *   Carbaldehyde: -CHO (named as the prefix \"formyl\")\n    *   Cyano: -CN (named as the prefix \"cyano\")\n    *   Hydroxyl: -OH (named as the prefix \"hydroxy\")\n    *   Dimethylamino: -N(CH3)2 (named as the prefix \"dimethylamino\")\n    *   Methoxy: -OCH3 (named as the prefix \"methoxy\")\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Substituents based on the Description:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at C1.\n    *   The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* to the carboxylic acid. This puts it at C4.\n    *   A key piece of information is used to resolve ambiguities: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n        *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n        *   The nitrile (-CN) is at C3 or C5.\n        *   The alcohol (-OH) is at C2 or C6.\n        *   Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n            *   **Case a:** If the nitrile is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. For the statement to be true, the methoxy must be at C4 (which it is) and the alcohol must be at C2. This is a consistent arrangement. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n            *   **Case b:** If the nitrile is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. For the statement to be true, the methoxy must be at C4 (which it is) and the alcohol must be at C6. This is also a consistent arrangement. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Arrangement:**\n    We have two possible structures that fit the description:\n\n    *   **Structure from Case a:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   Substituent locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    *   **Structure from Case b:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   Substituent locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n    Both potential numbering schemes yield the same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When this occurs, IUPAC rules state that the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents and Break the Tie:**\n    The alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes is:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n    Now we compare the locants for these substituents in the two possible structures:\n    *   **Structure a:** The first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, is at position **3**.\n    *   **Structure b:** The first alphabetical substituent, **cyano**, is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, Structure 'a' has the correct IUPAC numbering.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:**\n    Using the numbering from Structure 'a', we list the substituents alphabetically, each with its locant number, followed by the parent name.\n\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n\n    Combining these gives the full name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    This name matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
