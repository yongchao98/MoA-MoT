    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are told that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In physics and astronomy, this phrasing typically refers to a density or differential count. So, the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    We can write this as a proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The standard definition is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Relate the two distributions using the Chain Rule:** We want to convert a distribution with respect to parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) into a distribution with respect to distance (`dN/dr`). We can do this using the chain rule for derivatives. The number of stars `dN` in a given small population is invariant, so we can write:\n    `dN = (dN/dr) * dr`\n    `dN = (dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)`\n\n    Setting them equal and rearranging gives:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n    Since the number of stars and the range (`dr` or `d(plx)`) must be positive, we use the absolute value of the derivative (the Jacobian of the transformation):\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Derivative Term `|d(plx)/dr|`:** We need to differentiate the parallax-distance relation `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    The absolute value is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Relationships into the Chain Rule Formula:** Now we combine the pieces of information from the previous steps.\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Express the Result Solely in Terms of Distance `r`:** The current expression contains both `plx` and `r`. We must use the relation `plx = 1/r` to eliminate `plx`.\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the `plx⁻⁵` term:\n    `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n8.  **Final Simplification:** Substitute this back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance (`r`) changes in proportion to `r³`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
