    "*   **Analyze the options:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, a planet identical to Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_Earth. So, ρ_a = ρ_Earth.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as Earth's density. So, ρ_b ≈ ρ_Earth.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth\". For a planet with a given composition (e.g., a mix of rock and iron like Earth), a more massive planet will experience stronger self-gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the material in the planet's interior much more tightly. This compression effect increases the planet's overall average density. Therefore, a 5 Earth-mass planet with the same composition as Earth will be significantly denser than Earth. So, ρ_c > ρ_Earth.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"sub-Earth\". Following the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet will have weaker self-gravity. This results in less compression of its internal materials. Therefore, a planet with half the mass of Earth but the same composition will be less dense than Earth. So, ρ_d < ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **Compare the densities:**\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c > 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_d < 5.5 g/cm³\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The planet in option (c) is the most massive of the rocky planets described. The immense gravitational compression from its 5 Earth masses will result in the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
