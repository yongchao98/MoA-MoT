    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The decay process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) moving in opposite directions.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   Energy before (E_initial): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, E_π = m_π * c².\n    *   Energy after (E_final): The total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    *   Therefore:  `E_π = E_μ + E_ν`\n        `m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν`  (Equation 1)\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   Momentum before (p_initial): Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is 0.\n    *   Momentum after (p_final): The muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions. Let their momenta be p_μ and p_ν. The total momentum is the vector sum p_μ + p_ν.\n    *   Therefore: `0 = p_μ + p_ν`\n    *   This implies that their momentum vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p_μ| = |p_ν|`. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n\n5.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   For the muon (μ⁺): `E_μ² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²` => `E_μ = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²) `\n    *   For the neutrino (ν): Neutrinos are considered massless in this context (m_ν ≈ 0). So, `E_ν² = (p*c)² + 0` => `E_ν = p*c`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Momentum (p):**\n    Substitute the expressions for E_μ and E_ν back into the energy conservation equation (Equation 1):\n    `m_π * c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²) + p*c`\n    Rearrange to solve for `p*c`:\n    `m_π * c² - p*c = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²) `\n    Square both sides:\n    `(m_π * c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n    `(m_π * c²)² - 2*(m_π * c²)*(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n    The `(p*c)²` terms cancel out:\n    `(m_π * c²)² - 2*(m_π * c²)*(p*c) = (m_μ * c²)²`\n    Isolate the `p*c` term:\n    `2*(m_π * c²)*(p*c) = (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)²`\n    `p*c = [(m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)²] / [2 * (m_π * c²)]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of Neutrino (KE_ν):** Kinetic energy is `KE = E - m*c²`. Since the neutrino is massless, its rest mass energy is 0. Therefore, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n        `KE_ν = E_ν = p*c`\n    *   **KE of Muon (KE_μ):** The total energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value of the reaction) is the difference in rest mass between the initial and final states.\n        `Q = KE_μ + KE_ν = m_π * c² - m_μ * c²`\n        Therefore, `KE_μ = (m_π * c² - m_μ * c²) - KE_ν`\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    We can now use the given values to compute the kinetic energies. The following Python code implements the formulas derived above.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+)\n\n# From the conservation laws, we derived the formula for the momentum term 'pc'.\n# The units are MeV.\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses.\n# Q = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# Therefore, KE_mu can be found by subtracting KE_nu from the Q-value.\nQ_value = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\nKE_mu = Q_value - KE_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places.\n# The options list the smaller KE first, which belongs to the more massive particle (muon).\nprint(f\"KE of mu(+) = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the following results:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (μ⁺) = 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (ν) = 29.78 MeV\n\nComparing these values with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values (4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV) match option C. The user wants to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν).\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis is a particle decay problem, which is governed by two fundamental conservation laws in physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Set up the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Particle: Positive Pion (π⁺)\n    *   State: At rest.\n    *   Energy (E_initial): Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, `E_π = m_π * c²`.\n    *   Momentum (p_initial): Since it's at rest, its momentum is `0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Particles: Positive Muon (μ⁺) and Muon Neutrino (ν).\n    *   State: The two particles fly off in opposite directions to conserve momentum.\n    *   Energy (E_final): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, `E_μ + E_ν`.\n    *   Momentum (p_final): The vector sum of the momenta of the muon and neutrino, `p_μ + p_ν`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_μ + p_ν`\n    This means the momentum vectors of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as `p`.\n    `|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν`\n\n**4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺):\n    `E_μ = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²) `\n\n*   For the neutrino (ν):\n    Neutrinos have a very tiny mass, which is considered negligible (zero) in these calculations. So, `m_ν = 0`.\n    `E_ν = sqrt((p*c)² + (0)²) = p*c`\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies and Momenta**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for energy back into the energy conservation equation:\n`m_π * c² = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²) + p*c`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `p*c` (which is also the energy of the neutrino, `E_ν`):\n`m_π * c² - p*c = sqrt((p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²) `\n\nSquare both sides:\n`(m_π * c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n`(m_π * c²)² - 2*(m_π * c²)*(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ * c²)²`\n\nCancel the `(p*c)²` term from both sides:\n`(m_π * c²)² - 2*(m_π * c²)*(p*c) = (m_μ * c²)²`\n\nIsolate the `p*c` term:\n`2*(m_π * c²)*(p*c) = (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)²`\n`p*c = [ (m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_π * c²) ]`\n\n**6. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE)**\n\n*   **KE of Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Kinetic energy is `KE = E_total - E_rest`. Since the neutrino's rest mass energy (`m_ν * c²`) is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    `KE_ν = E_ν = p*c`\n\n*   **KE of Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The total energy of the muon is `E_μ = m_π * c² - E_ν`.\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is `KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ * c²`.\n    `KE_μ = (m_π * c² - E_ν) - m_μ * c²`\n    `KE_μ = (m_pi * c²) - (m_mu * c²) - KE_ν`\n\n**7.
