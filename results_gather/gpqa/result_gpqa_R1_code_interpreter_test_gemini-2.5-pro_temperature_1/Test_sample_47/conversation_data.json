    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product and determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the two α-carbons (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (an α-halo ketone) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base), with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** When an α-halo ketone with available protons on the other α'-carbon is treated with a strong base, a Favorskii rearrangement is a very common outcome.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The three-membered ring opens to relieve ring strain, leading to the formation of a more stable carbanion. This results in the contraction of the six-membered ring into a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate yields a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An elimination reaction (E2) could also occur to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction steps are characteristic for a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and highly efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and its H), the C1 carbon of the ring (the one attached to the aldehyde), and the H attached to C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is \"cis\" and one is \"trans\" relative to the aldehyde group on the adjacent carbon. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n*   C1 H: 1 type\n*   C2/C5 Protons: 2 types\n*   C3/C4 Protons: 2 types\n*   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe final answer is 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
