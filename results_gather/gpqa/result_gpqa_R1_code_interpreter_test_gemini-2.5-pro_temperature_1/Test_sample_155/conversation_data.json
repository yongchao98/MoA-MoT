    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1. mCPBA, 2. aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence achieves anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face (anti-addition).\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in the formation of a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Therefore, the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene yields a single product: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in the formation of a racemic mixture of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** Therefore, the reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the combined product mixture.**\n*   The chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) and the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic pair of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols).\n*   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   The relationship between these isomers is important:\n    *   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the outcome of the standard (achiral) HPLC analysis.**\n*   A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. This type of chromatography separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity and size.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated on a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into distinct peaks.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting racemic pair.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the outcome of the chiral HPLC analysis.**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase will interact differently with the (4R,5R)-diol and its mirror image, the (4S,5S)-diol, causing them to have different retention times. Thus, they will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute as a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
