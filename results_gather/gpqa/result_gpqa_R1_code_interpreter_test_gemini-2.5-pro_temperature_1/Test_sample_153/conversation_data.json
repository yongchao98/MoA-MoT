    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the nominal molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options. All options (Phenyl chloroformate, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzoic acid) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Let's calculate the nominal mass: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the M+ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula contains one chlorine atom and is consistent with all the given options.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimers.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   This finding eliminates option A (Phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester/acid chloride and would lack the broad O-H peak) and option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, but the combination of the very broad O-H and the NMR data points away from this). We are left with options B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (2-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet because it does not typically couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We have a total of 4 aromatic protons. The key information is the splitting pattern and integration. We see two signals, each being a doublet and each integrating to two protons. This symmetrical pattern is a hallmark of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one group equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other group equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n    *   Let's compare this to the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. It would exhibit the exact symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would deshield the ortho protons (likely the 8.02 ppm signal), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be at a slightly different chemical shift (likely the 7.72 ppm signal). This is a perfect match.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted benzene ring. There is no plane of symmetry that makes protons equivalent. All four aromatic protons are in chemically distinct environments. This would result in a much more complex spectrum, likely with four separate signals (e.g., multiplets), not two simple doublets. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the mass and presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the carboxylic acid group. The symmetrical aromatic pattern in the NMR (two doublets, 2H each) confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>"
