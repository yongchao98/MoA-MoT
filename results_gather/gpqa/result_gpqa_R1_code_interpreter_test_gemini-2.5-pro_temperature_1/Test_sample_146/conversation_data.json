    "Annihilation Process Analysis:\n1.  **Initial State:** The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. In particle physics problems of this nature, this usually means we can consider the annihilation to happen \"at rest\" in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n        *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n        *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest mass energy is also $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n        *   Since the initial particles are at rest (or moving very slowly), we neglect their kinetic energy.\n        *   Therefore, the total initial energy is $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n\n3.  **Final State:** The annihilation produces two particles of type $A^{+}$ and two of type $A^{-}$. These are a particle-antiparticle pair, and they all have the same mass $m_A$.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n        *   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n        *   The initial energy ($2 m_p c^2$) is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the four final particles.\n        *   The total relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n        *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the available kinetic energy will be distributed equally among the four identical final particles. This means they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n        *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Velocity:**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values:\n        $m_p c^2 = 938.27$ MeV\n        $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600}$\n    *   Next, we solve for the velocity $v$ using the definition of $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   We can use a short python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nmp_c2 = 938.27  # Rest mass energy of proton in MeV\nmA_c2 = 300     # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Conservation of energy: 2 * mp_c2 = 4 * gamma * mA_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = mp_c2 / (2 * mA_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta (v/c) from the definition of gamma\n# beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# The velocity of particle A is v = beta * c\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\nThe calculation yields a velocity of approximately 0.77c.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The fundamental principle governing this particle annihilation process is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the annihilation occurs with both particles effectively at rest.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of an antiproton is identical to that of a proton. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Therefore, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The initial energy is converted into the rest mass energy and kinetic energy of these four final particles.\n    *   Because the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the four resulting particles will share the available kinetic energy equally, meaning they all move at the same speed, $v$.\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is its relativistic energy, $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v$):**\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the known values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the Python script executed previously.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nmp_c2 = 938.27\n# Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\nmA_c2 = 300\n\n# From conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * mp_c2 = 4 * gamma * mA_c2\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = mp_c2 / (2 * mA_c2)\n\n# The relationship between gamma and velocity (beta = v/c) is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# We can rearrange this to solve for beta: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# The velocity of particle A is v = beta * c. We want to find beta.\nprint(f\"{beta:.2f}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "The code was executed to calculate the velocity of particle A based on the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Initial Energy**: The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the slowly moving antiproton, which is $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n2.  **Final Energy**: The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four resulting particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). Since they all have the same mass ($m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$) and, by symmetry, the same speed ($v$), the final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**: Equating the initial and final energies gives $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n4.  **Calculation**: The Python script solved for $\\gamma = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$ and then used the relation $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$ to find the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n5.  **Result**: The code output `0.77` confirms that $\\beta \\approx 0.77$. This means the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nThis calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
