    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental setup and its results. Let's break down the key information provided:\n\n1.  **Antigen and Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (antigens) are delivered orally. This means the immune response will be initiated in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n2.  **Location of Response:** Fluorescent cells are found in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a key component of GALT and are secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are mounted.\n3.  **Cellular Activity:** Proliferating cells are isolated. This indicates clonal expansion of lymphocytes (B cells and/or T cells) that have recognized the antigen.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The *variable heavy chain gene* is sequenced. The heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibodies B cells produce.\n5.  **Key Finding:** The sequencing reveals *high variability* in the variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of this information:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which determines the antibody's effector function. It does *not* alter the *variable* region, so it wouldn't account for the \"high variability\" observed there. While class switching is likely also occurring in this scenario (especially to IgA in the gut), it is not the process described by the finding.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) *during* B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. The experiment is looking at cells that are already responding to an antigen in a *secondary* lymphoid organ. Therefore, VDJ recombination has already been completed.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that is part of the innate immune response and can be activated by antibodies. It does not involve any genetic changes within B cells.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) *after* they encounter an antigen. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates the \"high variability\" observed. The goal of SHM is to generate B cells with higher affinity receptors for the antigen, a process known as affinity maturation.\n\nThe experimental findings perfectly match the description of somatic hypermutation: an antigen-driven process in a secondary lymphoid organ leading to proliferation and high variability in the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
