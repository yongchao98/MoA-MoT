    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it is coupled to a single proton. This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the methylene protons are coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H is typical for an amine group (-NH₂), where the protons often exchange and their signal is broadened.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde side chain (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's check if this structure is consistent with the NMR shifts. The electron-donating -NH₂ group would shield the ortho protons (making them appear upfield), while the electron-withdrawing -CH₂CHO group would deshield its ortho protons. The upfield doublet at 6.51 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to -NH₂, and the downfield doublet at 6.98 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to -CH₂CHO. This is consistent.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents, typically used at low temperatures (0-5 °C), cause diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻. The intermediate is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  **H₂O:** Adding water and warming the solution hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a standard method for synthesizing phenols. The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the product of the aldol condensation.**\n\n*   The aldol condensation is a two-step process: an aldol addition followed by a dehydration.\n*   **Aldol Addition:**\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):**\n    *   The presence of **heat** strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product.\n    *   The β-hydroxyl group (-OH on C3) is eliminated along with an acidic α-proton (H on C2).\n    *   This dehydration step forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group (C=C-C=O).\n    *   The product of this dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Step 4: Verify the molecular formula of the final product.**\n\nLet's confirm the molecular formula change during the condensation step.\n*   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has the formula C₈H₈O₂.\n*   The aldol condensation involves two molecules of this intermediate reacting and losing one molecule of water (H₂O).\n*   Formula of final product = 2 × (C₈H₈O₂) - H₂O = C₁₆H₁₆O₄ - H₂O = **C₁₆H₁₄O₃**.\n\nLet's use a Python script to calculate the formula of the structure proposed in Option B.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_formula(name):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molecular formula for the given compound name.\"\"\"\n    # Structure of 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:\n    # (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n    \n    # Let's count the atoms based on the fragments:\n    # Two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups: 2 * (C6H5O) = C12 H10 O2\n    # But-2-enal backbone without substituents: C4H4O\n    # Let's count from the structure directly, it's safer.\n    \n    # Phenyl rings: 2 * 6 = 12 C\n    # Butenal chain: 4 C\n    # Total C = 16\n    \n    # H on rings (4 per ring): 2 * 4 = 8 H\n    # H on OH groups: 2 * 1 = 2 H\n    # H on butenal chain:\n    # -CH2- group at C4: 2 H\n    # =CH- group at C3: 1 H\n    # -CHO group at C1: 1 H\n    # Total H = 8 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 14 H\n    \n    # Oxygen:\n    # Two OH groups: 2 O\n    # One CHO group: 1 O\n    # Total O = 3\n    \n    formula = \"C16H14O3\"\n    print(f\"The molecular formula for {name} is {formula}\")\n\ncalculate_formula(\"2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\")\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the formula of the product in Option B is C₁₆H₁₄O₃, which is consistent with a condensation reaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The \"Heat\" condition ensures that the reaction proceeds to the final dehydrated product, not just the initial addition product. Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₈H₉NO.\n    *   The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond or ring. The presence of an oxygen atom suggests a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-) with two protons. The splitting is a doublet (d), indicating it is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a -CH- group). This confirms the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment, as the methylene protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This chemical shift and broadening are typical for the protons of a primary amine group (-NH₂), which undergo rapid exchange.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde side chain (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   Intermediate A: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water and gently warming the solution causes the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Intermediate B: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the aldehyde from step 2 with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the product of the Aldol Condensation.**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-part process: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The product of this addition step would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the initial aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This dehydration forms a new carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings, making it a very stable product.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the Options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect connectivity.\n*   B) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This matches the structure of the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl).\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final *condensation* product formed under heat.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
