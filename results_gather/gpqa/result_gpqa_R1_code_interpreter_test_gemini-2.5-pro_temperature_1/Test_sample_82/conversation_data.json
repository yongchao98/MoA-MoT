    "This problem involves a titration calculation at two different points: 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n*   First, we dilute the acetic acid. We need to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution before the titration begins.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   The initial 20.00 cm³ (20.00 mL) of acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ (20.00 mL) of water.\n*   Total new volume = 20.00 mL + 20.00 mL = 40.00 mL = 0.04000 L\n*   New concentration of acetic acid:\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Titration Reaction**\nThe reaction between acetic acid (a weak acid, HA) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base, NaOH) is:\nCH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25:75, or 1:3. Since they are in the same volume, the concentration ratio is the same.\n    *   Ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.26\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n*   First, determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. At this point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Volume(NaOH) = Moles(acid) / Concentration(NaOH) = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 mL\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n    *   V(total) = V(diluted acid) + V(NaOH added) = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.05000 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] at this point:\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles(initial acid) / V(total) = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.020 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate, which can be calculated from Ka and Kw (the ion-product constant for water, 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] at equilibrium. Then [CH₃COOH] = x and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.020 M (since x is very small).\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / 0.020\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.020 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nLet's verify the calculations using a single script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Initial Conditions ---\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 0.02000  # L\nV_water = 0.02000 # L\nC_NaOH = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution Calculation ---\nmoles_acid = C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\nC_acid_diluted = moles_acid / V_acid_diluted\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence\nV_eq = moles_acid / C_NaOH\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nC_acetate = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n# Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n# [OH-] from hydrolysis of acetate: Kb = x^2 / C_acetate\n# x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C_acetate)\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * C_acetate)\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   First, we determine the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) in the 20.00 cm³ solution.\n    *   Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n    *   Concentration (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial Moles = M₁ × V₁ = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.00100 mol\n\n*   Next, we calculate the new concentration after diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n    *   New Concentration (M₂) = Initial Moles / V₂ = 0.00100 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base ([CH₃COO⁻]) to the acid ([CH₃COOH]) is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 + (-0.477)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = 0.00100 mol\n*   Calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required:\n    *   Volume(NaOH) = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n*   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.020 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which is related to the acid dissociation constant (Ka) and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.020.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.020\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches option C.\n\nThe Python code below verifies these calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Constants ---\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Initial Conditions ---\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 0.02000  # L\nV_water = 0.02000 # L\nC_NaOH = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution Calculation ---\nmoles_acid = C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial\nV_acid_diluted = V_acid_initial + V_water\nC_acid_diluted = moles_acid / V_acid_diluted\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration (Buffer Region) ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence\nV_eq = moles_acid / C_NaOH\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_eq\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nC_acetate = moles_acid / V_total_eq\n# Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n# [OH-] from hydrolysis of acetate: Kb = x^2 / C_acetate\n# x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C_acetate)\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * C_acetate)\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
