    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name to understand the structure:\n*   **pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This entire functional group, a cyclic ester, is called a **lactone**. Specifically, it's a delta-lactone because the oxygen is on the 5th carbon relative to the carbonyl carbon in the open-chain precursor.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **(R)-** or **(S)-**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is C4 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\nThe structure is a 6-membered lactone. This type of molecule is typically formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The open-chain precursor must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. Let's verify this:\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂OH(5)\nUpon acid-catalyzed intramolecular esterification, the -OH group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1. The resulting lactone will have the ethyl group at position 4 (C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone), which matches the product name.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's decode this IUPAC name:\n*   **pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group at C3.\n*   **5-isobutoxy-5-oxo**: This describes the substituent at C5. It means the C5 carbon is part of an isobutyl ester group (-C(=O)O-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nSo, the structure is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid where one carboxylic acid group is free (at C1) and the other (at C5) is esterified with isobutanol.\nStructure: **HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-iBu(5)**\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a single chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5, while the stereocenter is at C3. No bonds to the stereocenter are broken or formed, so its configuration is retained. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a reducing agent that is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, especially in the presence of less reactive esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the same 6-membered lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to reaction A, the reactions occur at C1 and C5, and the stereocenter at C3 is unaffected. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
