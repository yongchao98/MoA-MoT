    "*   **Analysis of Compound X from Spectral Data**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The broad singlet far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) is from protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) is from protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Group:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons, likely a -CH₂ group adjacent to both a -CH and a -CH₃ group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, likely a -CH group attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton) and also connected to the other parts of the alkyl chain.\n        *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n            *   Let's piece together the alkyl chain: We have a CH group attached to a CH₃ group (-CH(CH₃)-) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   If we attach both of these to the benzylic CH, we get the structure: `Ring-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n            *   Let's verify the splitting patterns with this sec-butyl structure:\n                *   The benzylic CH (2.9 ppm) is adjacent to a CH₃ (3H) and a CH₂ (2H). It would be split by 5 protons, resulting in a complex multiplet (m). This matches.\n                *   The CH₂ group (1.7 ppm) is adjacent to the benzylic CH (1H) and the terminal CH₃ (3H). It would be split by 4 protons, resulting in a complex multiplet (m) or a quintet. This matches.\n                *   The CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm is adjacent to the benzylic CH (1H), resulting in a doublet (d). This matches.\n                *   The CH₃ group at 0.9 ppm is adjacent to the CH₂ group (2H), resulting in a triplet (t). This matches.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The alkyl group is a sec-butyl group.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        *   Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃). It will also reduce alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to their corresponding alkanes.\n    3.  **Predicting the Product:**\n        *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 1 to a methyl group.\n        *   The benzene ring and the sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n        *   Therefore, the final product will be **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Matching with Options**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has an isobutyl group, not a sec-butyl group.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted final product.\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is structurally incorrect.\n\nThe correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
