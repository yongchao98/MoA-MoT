    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame of the observer, who is stationary.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass Frame):** This is the frame moving with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the glass (Frame S') relative to the laboratory (Frame S). The problem states this is `v`.\n    *   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (as measured in Frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of the light beam in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The direction is the same as `v`, so it's positive.\n    *   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (as measured in Frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    When velocities are in the same direction, the relativistic formula for adding velocities is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\nThis result is a famous one in physics, confirmed by the Fizeau experiment, and is one of the key results explained by Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
