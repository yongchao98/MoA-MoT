    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction substitutes a bromine atom for one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** CH3COOH → BrCH2COOH (Bromoacetic acid).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH → BrCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (a good leaving group) from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on this carbon (-CH2-) are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        Since *excess* NaH is used, the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂\n        This newly formed carbanion then undergoes an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion. This results in the formation of a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must identify all sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. We analyze the molecule's symmetry. Due to rapid chair-flipping and rotation around single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR time scale. This plane passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the cyano group, the ester group, and the opposite carbon in the ring (C4).\n\nLet's count the signals from each part of the molecule:\n\n1.  **The Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   **Methyl protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene protons (-O-CH₂-):** The C1 carbon of the ring is a prochiral center. The two methylene protons of the ethyl group are not related by the molecule's plane of symmetry. Therefore, they are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring (-C₆H₁₀-):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5. C4 is unique.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry. This makes them enantiotopic. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one \"axial-like\", one \"equatorial-like\") are diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to their counterparts on C6. Thus, the two \"axial-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent, and the two \"equatorial-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent. These two sets are distinct from each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The logic is the same as for C2/C6. The protons are diastereotopic, and the pairs of carbons are equivalent by symmetry. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from the ring = 1 (from C4) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) = 5 signals.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from both parts of the molecule:\nTotal Signals = 3 (from ethyl group) + 5 (from cyclohexane ring) = **8 signals**.\n\nThe 8 distinct sets of hydrogens are:\n1.  -CH₃ (3H)\n2.  -OCHₐHₙ- (1H)\n3.  -OCHₐHₙ- (1H)\n4.  C4-H₂ (2H)\n5.  C2-Hₐ, C6-Hₐ (2H)\n6.  C2-Hₙ, C6-Hₙ (2H)\n7.  C3-Hₐ, C5-Hₐ (2H)\n8.  C3-Hₙ, C5-Hₙ (2H)\n\nThus, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
