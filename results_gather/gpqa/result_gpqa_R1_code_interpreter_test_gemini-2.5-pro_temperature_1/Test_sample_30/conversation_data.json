    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nitration of toluene, a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃), nitric acid (HNO₃), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating group and an *ortho*, *para*-director. Nitration will occur at the positions ortho and para to the methyl group. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the *para* product is formed in a higher yield than the *ortho* product.\n*   **Product 1:** The major product is *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the oxidation of the methyl group on *p*-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reactants:** *p*-nitrotoluene, manganese dioxide (MnO₂), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** While very strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would oxidize the benzylic methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is a milder and more selective oxidizing agent. It is commonly used to oxidize allylic and benzylic positions to the aldehyde or ketone stage without affecting other functional groups or the aromatic ring. Therefore, the methyl group of *p*-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n*   **Reactants:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde, acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Mechanism:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens and thus cannot form an enolate; it can only act as the electrophile. The base (NaOH) removes an α-proton from acetone to form the nucleophilic acetone enolate (⁻CH₂COCH₃). The enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The initial aldol addition product rapidly undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water) under the reaction conditions to form a more stable, extended conjugated system.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is the α,β-unsaturated ketone, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The *E* (trans) isomer is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n    The structure is:\n    O₂N−(C₆H₄)−CH=CH−C(=O)−CH₃\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    1.  The molecule has an extended conjugated system, which favors a planar conformation for the main backbone (the benzene ring, nitro group, vinyl group, and carbonyl group).\n    2.  Let's consider the plane that contains this backbone.\n    3.  The only part of the molecule that is not necessarily in this plane is the three hydrogen atoms of the terminal methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    4.  Due to free rotation around the C-C single bond, the methyl group can adopt a conformation where one of its hydrogen atoms lies *in* the molecular plane, with the other two hydrogens positioned symmetrically above and below the plane.\n    5.  In this conformation, the plane of the molecular backbone acts as a **plane of symmetry (σ)**. Reflection in this plane leaves all atoms in the plane unchanged and swaps the two hydrogens that are out of the plane.\n    6.  We check for other symmetry elements:\n        *   There is no rotational axis (Cₙ for n > 1).\n        *   There is no center of inversion (i).\n    7.  A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
