    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`. The α-protons (on the CH₂) are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing ester groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), will deprotonate it to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This enolate is the nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tol-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The `p-tolyl` group is a toluene ring attached at the para position (`p-CH₃C₆H₄-`). The double bond is electrophilic, especially at the β-carbon, due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n    *   **Attack:** `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks `p-Tol-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   **Intermediate:** This forms a new enolate: `p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   **Protonation:** This intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) or during aqueous workup to yield the final stable product.\n    *   **Product (A) Structure:** `p-Tol-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n\n3.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   We use IUPAC nomenclature for polyfunctional compounds. The molecule has three methyl ester groups. We can name it as a substituted propane with three carboxylate groups attached.\n    *   **Parent Chain:** The central carbon chain is `(C from malonate) - (β-C from acrylate) - (α-C from acrylate)`. Let's number this as a propane chain: `C(1)-C(2)-C(3)`.\n    *   Let's draw the structure with the numbering that leads to the name in the options: `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-Tol) - CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   Let's name this using the suffix `-tricarboxylate`. The parent hydrocarbon is the longest chain to which the `COOH` (or `COOMe`) groups are attached. This chain is `H-CH-CH(p-Tol)-CH₂-H`, which is a substituted propane.\n    *   Numbering the propane chain: `C(1)H(COOMe)₂ - C(2)H(p-Tol) - C(3)H₂(COOMe)`. No, the carboxylate carbons are not part of the parent chain in this naming system.\n    *   The parent chain is `C-C-C`. Let's number it `C(1)-C(2)-C(3)`. The attachments are:\n        *   At C1: two `-COOMe` groups.\n        *   At C2: one `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   At C3: one `-COOMe` group.\n    *   So the structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH(1) - CH(2)(p-Tol) - CH₂(3)-COOMe`.\n    *   The name is based on `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. The esters are methyl esters, so it's `trimethyl`. There is a `p-tolyl` group at position 2.\n    *   **Final Name:** `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`. This matches option B.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   This is a **Stork enamine synthesis**, which proceeds via a Michael addition followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** `1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine`. This is an enamine, which serves as a nucleophilic enol equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** `(E)-but-2-enenitrile` (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. It's an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and C3 of the butanenitrile chain. This creates a new intermediate, an iminium salt, after an internal charge rearrangement.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (`H₃O⁺`) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine is removed, and a carbonyl group (C=O) is restored at the C1 position of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B) Structure:**\n    *   The result is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   **Product (B) Structure:** A cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at C2.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest chain including the nitrile carbon. This is a butanenitrile chain.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon: `N≡C(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(substituent)-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   The substituent is at C3. The substituent is the `cyclohexanone` ring, attached at its C2 position. The name for this substituent group is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   **Final Name:** `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto form is the major product, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`). This matches option B.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the Michael donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** `but-3-en-2-one` (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Base:** KOH.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bond Formation:**\n    *   In a Michael addition, the new bond is formed between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) in the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃`. This corresponds to the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product's name.\n    *   This `(3-oxobutyl)` group is attached to C2 of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring system.\n    *   Therefore, the new C-C bond is between C2 of the dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):**\n    *   Since C2 of the ring acted as the nucleophile, it must have come from the Michael donor after deprotonation by the base (KOH).\n    *   The carbon at C2 of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is an \"active methylene\" group, as its protons are highly acidic due to being positioned between two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the starting Michael donor (reactant C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n*   **B** is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n*   **C** is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n\nAll three of these match the components listed in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
