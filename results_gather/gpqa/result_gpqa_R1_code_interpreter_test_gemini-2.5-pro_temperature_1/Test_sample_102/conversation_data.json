    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. The bromo group is *meta* to the acetyl group. The nitro group is also *meta* to the acetyl group. The bromo and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### 3. Key Synthetic Constraints (Retrosynthesis)\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction (adding the -COCH₃ group) does not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a -NO₂ group. This means the acylation step must occur *before* the nitration step. This is a crucial constraint.\n*   **Final Substitution Pattern (1,3,5):** We need a sequence where the directing effects of the groups already on the ring lead to the desired isomer at each step.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Plausible Direct Routes\n\nBased on the constraint that acylation must precede nitration, let's consider two simple, three-step pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway 1: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone:** This introduces the acetyl group. The -COCH₃ group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (position 3).\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:**\n        *   The -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position (C5).\n        *   The -Br group (at C3) directs the incoming nitro group to its *ortho* and *para* positions (C2, C4, and C5 relative to the acetyl group).\n        *   Both groups direct towards or reinforce position 5. This leads cleanly to the desired product. This is a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Pathway 2: Acylation → Nitration → Bromination**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone:** Introduces the acetyl group (-COCH₃, a *meta*-director).\n    2.  **Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-Nitroacetophenone:** The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:**\n        *   The -COCH₃ group (at C1) directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C5).\n        *   The -NO₂ group (at C3) also directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C5).\n        *   Both groups direct to the same position, C5. This also leads cleanly to the desired product.\n\nBoth pathways are chemically sound. Now, we must check which of the given options corresponds to one of these valid pathways.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nThe options are complex 7-step sequences. We will trace each one to see if it's viable.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    *   Steps i-iv (Nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) start with benzene and end with benzene, which is redundant.\n    *   Steps v-vii are essentially: Bromination → Acylation → Nitration.\n        *   v) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   vi) Bromobenzene → p-Bromoacetophenone (major product, since -Br is o,p-directing).\n        *   vii) Nitration of p-bromoacetophenone gives 4-bromo-3-nitroacetophenone, which is the wrong isomer. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   This sequence involves nitration (step ii) before acylation (step iii). Step iii attempts to acylate 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (the major product from step ii). As established, Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on a ring containing a nitro group. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   This sequence also involves nitration (step i) before C-acylation (step iii). Aniline (product of step ii) reacts with AlCl₃ to form a complex that deactivates the ring, preventing Friedel-Crafts C-acylation. N-acylation (amidation) would occur, forming acetanilide. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) lead to the synthesis of 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. To get the final product, an acylation step would be needed, which is not possible on the deactivated 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene ring. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   Let's analyze the first three steps:\n        1.  `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3`: Benzene → **Acetophenone**.\n        2.  `ii) Br2/FeBr3`: Acetophenone → **3-Bromoacetophenone**.\n        3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: 3-Bromoacetophenone → **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   This sequence corresponds exactly to our valid \"Pathway 1\". It successfully produces the target molecule in high yield.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in the option (reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, etc.) are chemically nonsensical and would modify or destroy the product. However, the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis. Among the choices, this is the only option that contains a correct and high-yield synthetic route to the desired product within its sequence. The extra steps are likely an error in the question's formulation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions must begin with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration (or nitration and then bromination). Only Option C starts with a correct sequence of steps (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) that leads directly to the target compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
