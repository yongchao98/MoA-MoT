    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. A point charge `+q` is placed within this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P located outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the material of the conductor must be zero. To achieve this, a total charge of `-q` gets induced on the inner surface of the cavity. The distribution of this `-q` charge will be non-uniform and will arrange itself to perfectly cancel the electric field produced by `+q` for all points within the conductor and outside of it. This is a key principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The conductor itself acts as an electrostatic shield. This means that the charges on the outer surface (`+q`) are completely shielded from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (`+q` point charge and `-q` on the inner surface). As a result, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, as if the charges inside the cavity didn't exist. Since the conductor is a sphere of radius `R`, the charge `+q` spreads evenly over this outer spherical surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the sum of the fields from three sources:\n    *   The point charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the shielding effect mentioned in step 2, the net electric field at any point outside the cavity (including point P) from the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is exactly zero.\n\n    Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the uniformly distributed charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n6.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem, the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n\n    So, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its center's offset `s`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center to P, and the angle `Î¸` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors intended to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n    *   Comparing our result with the given options, we find that it matches option C.\n\n    A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This ignores the conductor.\n    B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. This uses an incorrect distance and ignores the conductor's properties.\n    C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. This correctly models the system as a point charge `q` at the center of the conductor due to shielding and induction.\n    D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. This uses an incorrect distance and ignores the conductor's properties.\n\n<<<C>>>"
