    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four given statements.\n\nThe **impulse approximation** is a simplification used to describe high-energy scattering from a bound system, like a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction between an external probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) and a constituent of the system (a nucleon) happens so quickly that the constituent can be treated as if it were a free particle during the brief moment of interaction. The binding forces that hold the nucleon within the nucleus are assumed to have a negligible effect during this short timescale.\n\nNow let's analyze each assumption:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a foundational requirement for the impulse approximation. If the probe were to interact with multiple nucleons at once (through what are known as meson-exchange currents or two-body currents), the picture of scattering off a single, isolated particle would break down. The interaction itself would be a many-body phenomenon. Therefore, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means that the incoming probe particle and any outgoing particles (like the recoiling nucleon) do not interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. These secondary interactions are called \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) or \"initial-state interactions.\" If these were significant, the observed final state would be a result of a complex series of scatterings, not just the single, \"impulsive\" interaction on the target nucleon. Thus, assuming the nucleus is transparent is crucial for the impulse approximation to be a valid description of the entire scattering process.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is a model of the *nucleon's behavior within the nucleus*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental entity. Whether the quarks *inside* that nucleon are relativistic or not is a separate question, related to the nucleon's form factors, but it is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. One can use the impulse approximation while still treating the nucleon's internal structure relativistically. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very essence of the impulse approximation. The name \"impulse\" refers to a large momentum transfer over a very short time. The assumption is that this time is so short that the relatively slow-acting binding forces from other nucleons can be ignored. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in place at the moment of interaction, and the scattering proceeds as if it were a free particle, unbound by the nuclear potential. This assumption is absolutely central to the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that are essential for the impulse approximation are:\n- The interaction involves only one nucleon (Assumption 1).\n- The rest of the nucleus is transparent to the probe and outgoing particles (Assumption 2).\n- The binding forces on the nucleon are negligible during the interaction (Assumption 4).\n\nTherefore, the combination of assumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly implies the impulse approximation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
