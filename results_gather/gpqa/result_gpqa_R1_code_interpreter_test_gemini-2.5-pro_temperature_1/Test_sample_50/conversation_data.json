    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Image Charges:**\n    This problem is a classic application of the method of image charges. To find the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, we can replace the sphere and its induced surface charge with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, combined with the original charge `q`, must produce a potential of zero on the spherical surface at radius `R`.\n\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Location:** It is placed at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n    Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `d' < R`, so the image charge is located inside the original sphere's volume.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy `U` of the system is equal to the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential is zero) to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A general formula for the potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    In our system, we have:\n    *   The point charge `q`.\n    *   The induced charge on the sphere, which has a total value equal to the image charge, `Q_induced = q'`.\n\n    So, the energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + Q_induced * V_sphere]`\n\n    Let's break down the terms:\n    *   `V_sphere`: The potential of the sphere is zero because it is grounded. So, `V_sphere = 0`.\n    *   `V_at_q`: This is the potential at the location of the point charge `q` created by the *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    The second term in the energy equation becomes `Q_induced * V_sphere = q' * 0 = 0`.\n    The energy formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\n4.  **Find the Potential at the Location of q:**\n    According to the method of images, the potential outside the sphere due to the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. Therefore, `V_at_q` is simply the potential at distance `d` from the center, created by the image charge `q'` which is at position `d'`.\n\n    The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `(d - d')`.\n\n    So, `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - d')`, where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'` into the formula for `V_at_q`:\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Finally, substitute this back into our simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The net potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, and work is done *by* the electric field when the charge is brought from infinity.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
