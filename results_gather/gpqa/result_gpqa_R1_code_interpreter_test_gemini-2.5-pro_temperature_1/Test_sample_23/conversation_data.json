    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. We will use integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as is common in such problems, and the value 14.28% suggests this.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This doesn't simplify to a constant value.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): %H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated with respect to reactions with bromine. This typically means no C=C or C≡C bonds, but aromatic rings also do not react with bromine water.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial as C=Z), and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   So, we need to identify D. D does not react with bromine water, and its hydrogenation product is Z (CnH2n).\n        *   Possibility 1: D is a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane, D could be methylcyclopentane). However, if Y consists of two isomers (CnH2n and another CnH2n), the reaction X -> Y would be an isomerization, not a disproportionation (a type of redox reaction). A disproportionation requires changes in oxidation levels (or, in this context, hydrogen content). The products C and D must have different hydrogen contents. Therefore, this possibility is incorrect.\n        *   Possibility 2: D is an aromatic compound (arene). Aromatic rings do not react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cycloalkanes under severe conditions.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that Y is a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and an arene (D). For both to produce only Z (CnH2n) upon hydrogenation, they must share the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Thus, Y = {CnH2n (Z, the cycloalkane), CnH2n-6 (D, the corresponding arene)}. For example, if Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mix of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must contain non-aromatic C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This implies that both A and B are unsaturated compounds with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: A + B → C + D. Since the mixture is equimolar on both sides, the reaction is 1A + 1B → 1C + 1D.\n    *   Let's substitute the formulas we found for C and D:\n        A + B → CnH2n + CnH2n-6\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved. Let A = CnHx and B = CnH_y.\n        x + y = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n - 6\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is x + y.\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n'**\n    *   We know Z is a widely used solvent like cyclohexane (n=6) or methylcyclohexane (n=7). Let's test both cases.\n    *   **Case 1: n = 6.**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene (C6H6)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X is x + y = 4*6 - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n        *   This is a plausible scenario. Mixture X could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both have a C6 ring, are non-conjugated, and decolorize bromine water. The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6 is a known hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   **Case 2: n = 7.**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene (C7H8)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X is x + y = 4*7 - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22.\n        *   This is also a plausible scenario. Mixture X could be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of hydrogens is 12 + 10 = 22.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   We have two plausible solutions: 18 (for the C6 system) and 22 (for the C7 system). Both options are available in the choices (D and C).\n    *   However, problems of this type usually have a single unique solution. The reaction described, the disproportionation of hydroaromatic compounds into an alkane and an arene over a platinum catalyst, is a classic reaction in organic chemistry. The most fundamental and widely-taught example of this is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis involving the C6 system (cyclohexene/dienes disproportionating to cyclohexane and benzene). It is highly probable that the question refers to this archetypal case.\n    *   Therefore, we choose the solution corresponding to n=6.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**. This corresponds to one molecule of cyclohexene (C6H10) and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\nFinal Calculation: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
