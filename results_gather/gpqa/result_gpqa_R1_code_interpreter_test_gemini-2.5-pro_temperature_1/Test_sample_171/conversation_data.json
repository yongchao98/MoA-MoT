    "This problem requires us to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The problem states that the stellar photospheres can be considered to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which justifies the use of this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:**\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (let's say level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature of the system in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars:**\n    Let's define the excitation ratio for a star as R = N₂ / N₁.\n    For star_1 with temperature T₁:\n    R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n\n    For star_2 with temperature T₂:\n    R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n    The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio R₁ is twice the population ratio R₂:\n    R₁ = 2 * R₂\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equation:**\n    Substitute the expressions for R₁ and R₂ into the relationship:\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    Since we are considering the same transition in iron for both stars, the energy difference ΔE and the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) are the same. We can cancel the (g₂/g₁) term from both sides:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  **Solving for the Relationship between T₁ and T₂:**\n    To solve for T₁ and T₂, we first take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x):\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n5.  **Using the Given Numerical Values:**\n    The problem provides the energy difference:\n    ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n    The Boltzmann constant, a fundamental constant in physics, is:\n    k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    Let's calculate the ratio (ΔE / k). The problem is likely designed such that this ratio is simple.\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K.\n\n    To be more precise, let's use a quick python script to check the value.\n    ```python\n    import scipy.constants\n    \n    # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    k_boltzmann = scipy.constants.k\n    \n    # Given energy difference in J\n    delta_E = 1.38e-23\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio ΔE / k\n    ratio = delta_E / k_boltzmann\n    \n    print(f\"Boltzmann constant (k): {k_boltzmann:.6e} J/K\")\n    print(f\"Given energy difference (ΔE): {delta_E:.6e} J\")\n    print(f\"Ratio (ΔE / k): {ratio:.6f} K\")\n    ```\n    \n    The code will confirm that the ratio is very close to 1.\n    \n    Given that the value of ΔE is stated as \"approximately\" 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J, and the options are exact forms, it is intended that we take the ratio (ΔE / k) to be exactly 1.\n\n6.  **Final Equation:**\n    Substituting (ΔE / k) = 1 into our derived equation:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n    This equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
