    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. The radius of this circle will be equal to the apothem `a`.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`. This is the classic Fraunhofer diffraction problem for a circular aperture, which produces an Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution for the Airy pattern is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the center.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is equal to zero, for non-zero arguments. Let `zₙ` be the n-th zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe condition for the n-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ`\n\nThe problem states we can use the small angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So, the equation becomes:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θn = zₙ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₙ` of the n-th minimum:\n`θₙ = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to `n=1` and `n=2`.\n*   Angular position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n*   Angular position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n\nNow, we need the values of the first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`:\n*   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nLet's calculate the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`:\n`Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...) = 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1(x).\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by theta_n = (z_n * lambda) / (2 * pi * a),\n# where z_n is the n-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# We need the angular distance between the first two minima (n=1 and n=2).\n# Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1 = ((z_2 - z_1) / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)\n\n# Find the first two non-trivial zeros of J1(x)\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nz1 = zeros[0]\nz2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n>>>0.507\n\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately 0.507.

    "As the number of sides `N` of a regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circle of radius `a`. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` of the pattern at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, defined as `k = 2π / λ`, where `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `θ` is the angular distance from the center of the pattern.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the argument of the Bessel function `J₁(x)` is equal to one of its non-trivial zeros. Let `zₙ` be the n-th zero of `J₁(x)`.

These correspond to `n=1` and `n=2`.\n\n*   Angular position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n*   Angular position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nThe angular distance between them, `Δθ`, is:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the value of the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`:\n*   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nLet's calculate the coefficient:\n`Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π) = 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\nSo, `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n\nTo obtain a more precise result, we can use a python script to find the zeros of the Bessel function and perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1(x).\n# The angular position of the n-th minimum is given by theta_n = (z_n * lambda) / (2 * pi * a),\n# where z_n is the n-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# We need the angular distance between the first two minima (n=1 and n=2).\n# Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1 = ((z_2 - z_1) / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a)\n\n# Find the first two non-trivial zeros of J1(x)\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nz1 = zeros[0]\nz2 = zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\nThe python code calculates the coefficient to be 0.507.
