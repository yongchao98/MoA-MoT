    "SMEFT, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM). It assumes that any new physics beyond the SM appears at a much higher energy scale, Î›. The theory is built by adding higher-dimensional operators, constructed from the SM fields, to the SM Lagrangian. The construction of these operators must respect certain fundamental symmetries. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All relativistic quantum field theories, which form the basis of particle physics, are built to be Lorentz invariant. The operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). This is a foundational requirement for any sensible QFT describing our universe at the energy scales we probe.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a cornerstone of modern quantum field theory and is a required symmetry for the construction of SMEFT operators. Any theory that is Poincare invariant is also Lorentz invariant.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, primarily through the complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in the weak interactions. Since the SM is not CP-symmetric, there is no reason to impose this symmetry on the higher-dimensional SMEFT operators. In fact, many SMEFT operators are specifically constructed to be CP-violating, parameterizing new potential sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry is **not** a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and Time Reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. This is one of the most robust symmetries in physics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry. Therefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
