    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product's Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the reaction product from the provided NMR data. The starting material, Compound X, has the molecular formula C11H12O. Since the reaction is conducted with a base (DABCO) at high temperature in a nonpolar solvent, it is most likely an isomerization or rearrangement. Therefore, the product will also have the molecular formula C11H12O.\n\n*   **Calculate Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    For a formula CxHyOz, DoU = x - y/2 + 1.\n    For C11H12O, DoU = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    This high value suggests the presence of at least one benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and other rings or double bonds.\n\n*   **Analyze the 13C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   δ 197.7 (1C, s): This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a ketone, as there is no aldehyde proton in the 1H NMR spectrum. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   δ 126.9 - 144.1: There are 8 carbons in this region, typical for aromatic and vinylic (alkene) carbons. A single benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons. This suggests the presence of one benzene ring (4 DoU) and one C=C double bond (1 DoU).\n    *   Total DoU accounted for: 4 (benzene) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) = 6. This matches the calculated DoU.\n    *   δ 21.3 and δ 28.4: These are two carbons in the aliphatic region, corresponding to the two methyl groups observed in the 1H NMR.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two methyl (CH3) groups that are not adjacent to any protons (i.e., they are attached to quaternary carbons, a carbonyl group, or an aromatic ring).\n    *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, indicates two protons on a C=C double bond that are coupled to each other (-CH=CH-).\n\n*   **Assemble the Product Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A ketone group (-C(=O)-)\n    2.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n    3.  A disubstituted alkene group (-CH=CH-)\n    4.  Two methyl groups (-CH3)\n\n    Let's assemble them. To have two methyl singlets, one must be on the benzene ring (making it a tolyl group), and the other must be attached to the ketone (making it an acetyl group).\n    *   Fragment 1: A p-tolyl group (CH3-C6H4-). This accounts for one CH3 singlet and the 1,4-disubstituted ring pattern.\n    *   Fragment 2: An acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-). This accounts for the other CH3 singlet and the ketone.\n    *   Fragment 3: The alkene linker (-CH=CH-).\n\n    Connecting these pieces gives the structure:\n    **CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3**\n    This is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n    Let's check if this structure is consistent with the NMR data:\n    *   **CH3** on the tolyl ring: A singlet (~2.3 ppm). Matches δ 2.31.\n    *   **CH3** of the acetyl group: A singlet (~2.3 ppm). Matches δ 2.28.\n    *   Protons on the **p-tolyl ring**: Two doublets (2H each). Matches δ 7.08 and 7.71.\n    *   **Vinylic protons** (-CH=CH-): Two doublets (1H each). The proton alpha to the carbonyl is expected around 6.7 ppm, and the proton beta to the carbonyl is expected around 7.6 ppm. This is an excellent match for δ 6.75 and δ 7.68.\n    *   The structure is fully consistent with all data.\n\n**2. Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization that converts Compound X into 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Since the product contains a p-tolyl (4-methylphenyl) group, the starting material must also contain this group, as the reaction conditions do not allow for the methylation of a phenyl ring.\n\nLet's examine the given options for Compound X:\n*   A) 2-styrylepoxide: Contains a phenyl group (C6H5-), not a p-tolyl group.\n*   B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-. This compound contains a p-tolyl group. Its formula is C11H12O.\n*   C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n*   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option (B) has the correct carbon skeleton (the p-tolyl group) to be the precursor to the identified product. The reaction is a known, if complex, rearrangement of a vinylic epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone under thermal/basic conditions.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
