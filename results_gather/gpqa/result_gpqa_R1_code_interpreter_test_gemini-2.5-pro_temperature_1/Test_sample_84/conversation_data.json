    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)\n\n    The ratio is:\n    Ratio = T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n    Ratio = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    Ratio = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\n    Ratio = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Data:** We are given information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the Doppler shifts (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K_star, the semi-amplitude) by:\n    K_star = c * (Δλ / λ)\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ` is the rest wavelength.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K_star is related to the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by:\n    K_star = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    Since the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbits are nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination `i` ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1. The planet's orbital velocity `v_p` is sqrt(G*M_star / a) (assuming m_p << M_star).\n    K_star ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K_star ≈ m_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis `a`:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K_star^2 = m_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))\n    a = (m_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio a2 / a1:** Now we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    a2 / a1 = [(m2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(m1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (m2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / m1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n8.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (m2 / m1):**\n        m1 = 7 M_earth\n        m2 = 5 M_earth\n        m2 / m1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **Velocity Amplitude Ratio (K_star1 / K_star2):**\n        This ratio is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts, since K_star = c * (Δλ / λ).\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Combine Ratios to find a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Planet masses in Earth masses\nm1 = 7.0\nm2 = 5.0\n\n# The ratio of the star's radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K_star1 / K_star2)\n# is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nK_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the planet masses (m2 / m1).\nm_ratio = m2 / m1\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) is derived from the formula\n# a = (m_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star^2).\n# This gives a2 / a1 = (m2/m1)^2 * (K_star1/K_star2)^2.\na_ratio = m_ratio**2 * K_ratio**2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is sqrt(a2 / a1).\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n<<<\n0.5357142857142857\n>>>\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.5357, which rounds to 0.53.

    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2.\n    Ratio = T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so A1 = A2, and the term (1 - A)^(1/4) cancels out.\n    *   The constant '2' also cancels out.\n    *   The simplified ratio becomes:\n        Ratio = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    *   So, the problem boils down to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Parameters to Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity (RV) method gives us the Doppler shift (Δλ), which is proportional to the star's RV semi-amplitude (K_star).\n    *   K_star = c * (Δλ / λ), where c is the speed of light and λ is the rest wavelength.\n    *   The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n        K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n6.  **Find the Relationship Between Semi-Major Axis (a) and RV Semi-Amplitude (K_star):** For a planet in a circular orbit, where the planet's mass (m_p) is much less than the star's mass (M_star), the star's RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n    K_star ≈ (m_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity, and `i` is the orbital inclination. Since the planets are detected via the transit method, the orbit is edge-on, so we can assume i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    The planet's orbital velocity is v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\n    Substituting v_p into the K_star equation:\n    K_star ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (m_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n7.  **Solve for 'a' and find the ratio a2/a1:**\n    *   Squaring the equation: K_star^2 ≈ (m_p^2 / M_star) * (G / a)\n    *   Solving for `a`: a ≈ G * m_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n        a2 / a1 = [G * m2^2 / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [G * m1^2 / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\n    *   Since G and M_star are the same for both planets, they cancel out:\n        a2 / a1 = (m2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / m1^2)\n        a2 / a1 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n8.  **Combine Steps to Find the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   We found that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).\n    *   Substituting the expression for a2 / a1:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (m2 / m1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2 )\n    *   The square root cancels the squares:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2 / m1) * (K_star1 / K_star2)\n\n9.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Mass ratio (m2 / m1): Planet2 has mass 5 M_earth, and Planet1 has mass 7 M_earth.\n        m2 / m1 = 5 / 7\n    *   RV ratio (K_star1 / K_star2): This is equal to the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n        K_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n    *   Final Temperature Ratio:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Use Python to compute the final decimal value.**\n\n```python\n# Masses of the planets in Earth masses\nm1 = 7.0\nm2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of planet masses\nmass_ratio = m2 / m1\n\n# The ratio of the star's radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K_star1 / K_star2)\n# is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nk_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is given by (m2/m1) * (K_star1/K_star2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * k_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```",
    "The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is determined by the ratio of their orbital distances from the star. The equilibrium temperature T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\nThe semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass (m_p) and the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) it induces. For a circular orbit, K_star is proportional to m_p / √a. Rearranging this for `a` shows that `a` is proportional to (m_p / K_star)².\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n\na2 / a1 = (m2 / K_star2)² / (m1 / K_star1)² = (m2/m1)² * (K_star1/K_star2)²\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(m2/m1)² * (K_star1/K_star2)²]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2 / m1) * (K_star1 / K_star2)\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K_star1 / K_star2) is equal to the ratio of the observed Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n\nWe are given:\n*   m1 = 7 M_earth\n*   m2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   Mass ratio (m2 / m1) = 5 / 7\n*   Doppler shift ratio (K_star1 / K_star2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
