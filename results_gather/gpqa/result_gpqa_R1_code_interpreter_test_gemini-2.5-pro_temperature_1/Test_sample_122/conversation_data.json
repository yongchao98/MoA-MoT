    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be the \"stationary\" frame, S.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be the \"moving\" frame, S'.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by the simple formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame S.\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time passes at different rates for observers in relative motion. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is longer than the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   We can use the standard approximation for the speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy Frame (d):**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `Δt` into the distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt')`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Combine `v` and `Δt'`:\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) km / sqrt(0.96) = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To find the numerical value, we can use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s\n# Using a common approximation for c in physics problems\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame\ndelta_t_galaxy = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance=}\")\n\n# Alternative approach using binomial approximation for gamma\n# gamma ≈ 1 + 0.5 * beta^2\ngamma_approx = 1 + 0.5 * beta**2\ndistance_approx = v * gamma_approx * delta_t_prime\nprint(f\"{distance_approx=}\")\n\n```\n>>>\ndistance=3061862.178478366\ndistance_approx=3060000.0\n>>>\nThe precise calculation gives `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`. This value is extremely close to option A.\n\nThe reason option A is likely the correct answer is that for small `v/c`, the Lorentz factor can be approximated using the binomial expansion: `γ = (1 - β²)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (1/2)β²`.\n*   `β² = 0.04`\n*   `γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)(0.04) = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n*   `d = (v * Δt') * γ ≈ 3,000,000 km * 1.02 = 3,060,000 km`.\n\nThis approximation gives the exact value of option A, suggesting it was the intended method for this problem.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Non-relativistic distance: `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n*   Relativistic correction (time dilation) requires multiplying by the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n*   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)²) ≈ 1.0206`.\n*   Relativistic distance = `3,000,000 km * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n*   Using the binomial approximation (`γ ≈ 1.02`), the distance is `3,000,000 km * 1.02 = 3,060,000 km`.\n*   This matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and given information:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured in the moving object's own frame, it is the *proper time*.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). This distance is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the proper time (`Δt'`) measured in the moving frame (the ejecta). This relationship is described by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, let's find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance `d`:**\n    Now we can calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt')`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    Calculating the value:\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n    This value is extremely close to option A. Often in these types of problems, an approximation is used for the Lorentz factor when `v` is much smaller than `c`. Let's check this approximation.\n\n    **Using Binomial Approximation (a common method for such problems):**\n    For small `x`, `(1 - x)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (1/2)x`.\n    `γ = (1 - β²)^(-1/2)`. Here `x = β² = 0.04`.\n    `γ ≈ 1 + (1/2) * β² = 1 + (1/2) * 0.04 = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n\n    Now, calculate the distance using this approximate `γ`:\n    `d = (v * Δt') * γ ≈ (3,000,000 km) * 1.02 = 3,060,000 km`\n\n    This result exactly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
