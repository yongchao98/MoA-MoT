    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and its energy is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy-time uncertainty relation is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty or \"width\" of the energy level.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Interpret the problem:**\n    *   Each energy level (E1 and E2) is not a perfectly sharp line but is \"smeared out\" or broadened due to its finite lifetime. The amount of this broadening is its energy width, ΔE.\n    *   The lifetime of each state is given: Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s and Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₂ - E₁|) must be greater than the broadening of the levels. A common criterion is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths (ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂), or at least greater than the width of the broader level.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n    We can calculate the minimum energy width for each state using the uncertainty principle. For order-of-magnitude estimates, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n    *   For state 1 (with the shorter lifetime, hence the larger energy width):\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   For state 2:\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n\n4.  **Determine the required separation:**\n    The total energy width is ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    The energy difference, let's call it ΔE_sep, must be significantly larger than this total width for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n    ΔE_sep > ΔE_total = (ħ / Δt₁) + (ħ / Δt₂)\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    Let's use a Python script to compute the required energy separation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Given lifetimes\nt1 = 1e-9  # seconds\nt2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy width for each state using the approximation delta_E ~ h_bar / delta_t\n# A factor of 1/2 from the formal inequality is often dropped for this type of resolution problem,\n# as we are interested in the order of magnitude.\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / t1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / t2\n\n# The total width is the sum of the individual widths.\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than this total width.\ntotal_width = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\n# The broader level (shorter lifetime) provides the main constraint.\nlarger_width = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The energy separation should be greater than the larger width, which is ~{larger_width:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the total width, which is ~{total_width:.3e} eV.\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe energy separation should be greater than the larger width, which is ~6.582e-07 eV.\nA more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the total width, which is ~7.240e-07 eV.\n```\n\n6.  **Analyze the results and select the answer:**\n    *   The calculation shows that the energy width of the first state (ΔE₁) is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The energy width of the second state (ΔE₂) is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   For the two energy levels to be resolved, their energy difference must be larger than their natural widths. The dominant (larger) width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n        *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be clearly resolved.\n        *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n        *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap significantly.\n        *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n\n    Therefore, the only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two levels can be clearly distinguished is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty or \"width\" of its energy level, a concept governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n**1. The Principle:**\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is given by:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (the energy width of the state).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor order-of-magnitude estimations, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width of Each State:**\nEach energy level is not a perfectly sharp line but is \"broadened\" by an amount ΔE due to its finite lifetime.\n\n*   **For the first state:**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state:**\n    *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Condition for Resolution:**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₂ - E₁|) must be significantly larger than their energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy width (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), which is the primary factor limiting the resolution. A common criterion is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the individual widths, or at least greater than the larger of the two widths.\n\n*   The required energy separation must be greater than the larger width, so |E₂ - E₁| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Compare with the Options:**\nWe need to find the option that is greater than ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷). This separation would allow the levels to be clearly resolved.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap significantly.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the levels can be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
