    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### **1. Understanding C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   **A C3 axis of rotation:** The molecule is unchanged after a rotation of 360°/3 = 120° around this axis.\n*   **A σh (horizontal) mirror plane:** The molecule is unchanged after reflection through a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\nThe presence of these two elements also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n### **2. Analyzing Each Molecule**\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core can be considered planar, creating a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane passing through the boron atom.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** If we consider the BO3 plane as the potential horizontal mirror plane (σh), the isopropyl groups [-CH(CH3)2] must be symmetrical with respect to this plane. Each isopropyl group has a central carbon atom bonded to a hydrogen and two methyl groups. These groups are not planar. The methyl groups and the hydrogen atom lie off the BO3 plane. There is no conformation where the part of the isopropyl group above the plane is a mirror image of the part below the plane.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule can adopt a \"propeller-like\" C3 conformation, but it lacks the σh plane required for C3h symmetry. Its point group is likely C3.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It consists of a nitrogen and a carbon atom at the bridgehead positions, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen and the bridgehead carbon atom. Looking down this axis, a 120° rotation superimposes the ethylene bridges onto each other. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. A plane midway through the bridges would not work because the top of the molecule has a nitrogen atom and the bottom has a carbon atom. The molecule does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes places quinuclidine in the **C3v** point group, not C3h.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is commonly known as **mellitic trianhydride**. It consists of a central benzene ring fused symmetrically with three furan-dione (anhydride) rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh), as it is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   Further analysis shows that there are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor are there any vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane (and no other symmetry elements that would lead to a higher symmetry group like D3h) means this molecule belongs to the **C3h** point group. This is a classic textbook example of C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a larger analogue of molecule C, with a triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon made of four fused benzene rings. The three anhydride groups are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene system.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   In its idealized form, this molecule is also planar.\n    *   Similar to molecule C, it would possess a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The molecular plane would serve as a σh plane.\n    *   Therefore, its idealized point group would also be **C3h**.\n*   **Comparison with C:** While both B and C have an idealized C3h structure, molecule B is much larger and more sterically strained. Large, strained polycyclic systems often deviate from planarity to relieve this strain. If the molecule buckles or twists, it would lose its σh plane and thus its C3h symmetry. Molecule C (mellitic trianhydride) is a smaller, more rigid system that is known to be planar and a definitive example of C3h symmetry. In a multiple-choice question with a single correct answer, the most unambiguous and archetypal example is the intended answer.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nMolecule C, mellitic trianhydride, is a clear and well-established example of a molecule with C3h symmetry. While molecule B could also have this symmetry in an idealized planar form, its planarity is less certain due to potential steric strain. Triisopropyl borate (A) and quinuclidine (D) definitively do not have C3h symmetry. Therefore, molecule C is the best and most certain answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
