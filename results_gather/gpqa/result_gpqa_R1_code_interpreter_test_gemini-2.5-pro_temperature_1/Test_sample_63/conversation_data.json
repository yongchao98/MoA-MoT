    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze what each tube tells us about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** The mass increased by 3.60 g. Magnesium perchlorate is a powerful drying agent, which means it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The mass of this tube did not change. Calcium hydroxide solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂, which would react to form a precipitate and increase the mass of the tube (e.g., CO₂ + Ca(OH)₂ → CaCO₃(s) + H₂O). The fact that the mass did not change strongly implies that no acidic gases were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This indicates that the gas mixture contained an oxidizing agent that reacted with copper. The mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Common gases from salt decomposition that can oxidize hot copper are O₂, N₂O, or NO. The oxygen atoms in these gases are the source of the mass increase.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained (at standard temperature and pressure, STP). This gas must be inert to all the previous reagents (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu).\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   A common inert gas produced in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Deduce the Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the initial gaseous products were H₂O, an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 mol of oxygen, and an inert gas which is likely N₂. Let's identify the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   Consider the decomposition of common nitrogen-containing salts. They often produce N₂ and N₂O. Let's hypothesize that the oxidizing gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The reaction with copper is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   This reaction provides one oxygen atom per molecule of N₂O.\n    *   Since 0.05 mol of O atoms reacted, there must have been **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n*   Now let's account for the final gas C (0.1 mol of N₂). This total amount of N₂ is the sum of N₂ produced directly from the salt decomposition and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   Total N₂ = (Initial N₂) + (N₂ from N₂O reaction)\n    *   0.1 mol = (Initial N₂) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Initial N₂ = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\nSo, the original mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was:\n*   **0.2 mol of H₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂O**\n*   **0.05 mol of N₂**\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are looking for an equimolar mixture of two salts (A and B) that decompose upon heating to produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O in a 0.05 : 0.05 : 0.2 molar ratio (which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4).\n\nLet's consider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of these two salts, let's say 'n' moles of each:\n*   n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n*   n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂O + 2n H₂O\n\nThe total products would be:\n*   n moles of N₂\n*   n moles of N₂O\n*   2n + 2n = 4n moles of H₂O\n\nThe molar ratio of the products (N₂ : N₂O : H₂O) is n : n : 4n, which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4. This perfectly matches the ratio we deduced from the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Verify with Mass Data**\n\nFrom our product analysis, we found that n = 0.05 mol. Let's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass, confirming our identification of the salts and their quantities.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
