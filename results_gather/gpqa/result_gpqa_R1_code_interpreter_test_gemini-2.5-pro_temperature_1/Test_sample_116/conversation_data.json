    "To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is typically due to the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality (as in atropisomerism), and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Analysis:** In biphenyl systems, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings can be restricted if there are large, bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Chirality:** Because of this restricted rotation, the molecule and its mirror image are not superimposable. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group.\n    *   The groups attached to C2 are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Chirality:** Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized as it is part of a C=O double bond. It is only bonded to three entities (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond.\n*   **Chirality:** Any molecule that possesses a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It has a C=C double bond, and the carbons involved are sp² hybridized, so they cannot be chiral centers. The molecule has a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, it has a **center of inversion** (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality:** A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It does, however, exhibit geometric (cis-trans) isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
