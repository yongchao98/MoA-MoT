    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane has a tricyclic (3 rings) saturated hydrocarbon framework.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and the high temperature suggests elimination or rearrangement reactions are possible.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons, which matches the number of protons in the starting material. This suggests a formula of C10H14O for Product 1.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** For a formula C10H14O, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2*C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4. A carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for one degree of unsaturation. The remaining three degrees correspond to the three rings of the adamantane skeleton (or an isomeric tricyclic skeleton).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** Product 1 is a tricyclic ketone with the formula C10H14O. While the provided NMR data (especially the 4.79 ppm signal) is unusual for a simple adamantanone, the problem's progression relies on its identity as a ketone. A plausible product from rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton is an isomer like protoadamantan-4-one or adamantane-2-one.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃). This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. So, the C=O group in Product 1 is converted to a CH-OH group.\n*   **Contradiction:** The next step is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond. However, the MPV reduction of a saturated ketone (like the C10H14O deduced above) would yield a saturated alcohol (C10H16O).\n*   **Resolving the Contradiction:** The most likely explanation is that the reaction conditions (\"heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide\") lead to both the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol *and* the subsequent dehydration of that alcohol to form an alkene.\n    *   Product 1 (Ketone, C10H14O) ---[Reduction]--> Intermediate Alcohol (C10H16O) ---[Dehydration]--> Product 2 (Alkene, C10H14).\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The dehydration of adamantane-based alcohols often involves skeletal rearrangements to form more stable alkenes that do not violate Bredt's rule (which forbids double bonds at a bridgehead carbon). A very common and stable product from such rearrangements is **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This tricyclic alkene has the formula C10H14, which is consistent with our hypothesis.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene, C10H14) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Ozonolysis of the double bond in protoadamantene breaks one of the rings in the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic molecule. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamantene yields a product containing both a ketone and an aldehyde group. The resulting structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde**. The formula is C10H14O2.\n\n```python\n# This is a thought-process tool, not a part of the final chemical reasoning.\n# It helps to visualize the problem but the chemical steps are the core logic.\n# Let's represent the steps as a python script to outline the logic.\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    # Step 1: Identify Product 1\n    # Starting Material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2)\n    # Reaction: + KOH, 240C\n    # Data: IR 1720 cm-1 (ketone), 14H in NMR\n    # Inference: Product 1 is a tricyclic ketone, C10H14O. e.g., adamantane-2-one or an isomer.\n    product_1 = \"Tricyclic Ketone (C10H14O)\"\n\n    # Step 2: Identify Product 2\n    # Reaction: Product 1 + Al(O-iPr)3, heat\n    # Inference: The reaction involves reduction (ketone -> alcohol) followed by dehydration (alcohol -> alkene)\n    # The likely alkene is protoadamantene (C10H14), a stable rearranged isomer.\n    product_2 = \"Protoadamantene (C10H14)\"\n\n    # Step 3: Identify Product 3\n    # Reaction: Product 2 + 1) O3, 2) DMS\n    # Inference: Ozonolysis of the double bond in protoadamantene.\n    # This opens one ring and forms a keto-aldehyde.\n    product_3 = \"bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde (C10H14O2)\"\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 3\n    # Question: Coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (non-exchangeable).\n    #\n    # Protons in Product 3:\n    # 1.

It is attached to the C7 carbon, which has one proton (H7). Thus, the aldehyde proton would appear as a doublet. Since \"doublet\" is not an option, the question must be referring to the most deshielded proton on the carbon skeleton.\n*   The next most deshielded proton is H7, the proton on the carbon (C7) that is alpha to the strongly electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. Its chemical shift would be around δ = 3-4 ppm. Protons alpha to the ketone (on C2 and C4) and the other bridgehead protons (H1, H5) would be further upfield.\n*   Now, we analyze the coupling (splitting) pattern of H7. H7 is located on a bridge carbon in the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework. It has several neighbors to which it can couple:\n    *   The two protons on the adjacent carbon C6.\n    *   The two protons on the adjacent carbon C8.\n    *   The single proton on the adjacent bridgehead carbon C1.\n*   Assuming the bicyclic system adopts a symmetric conformation (like the classic chair-chair), the two methylene groups (-CH₂-) at C6 and C8 are chemically equivalent with respect to H7. In this conformation, H7 will couple to two axial protons (one on C6, one on C8) and two equatorial protons (one on C6, one on C8).\n*   The coupling constants for axial-axial (J_aa) and axial-equatorial (J_ae) interactions are typically different (J_aa is large, ~10-13 Hz; J_ae is small, ~2-5 Hz).\n*   Therefore, H7 is split by two equivalent axial protons into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then split again by two equivalent equatorial protons into another **triplet**.\n*   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. The coupling to the other bridgehead proton (H1) is a long-range coupling and is often small enough to be unresolved or ignored in predicting the major splitting pattern.\n\nBased on this analysis, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded skeletal hydrogen atom (H7) is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the structures of three products from a series of reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane is a rigid tricyclic alkane.\n*   **Reaction:** It is heated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base, at a high temperature (240°C). These are harsh conditions that can promote complex rearrangements.\n*   **Product 1 Analysis:**\n    *   The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically a ketone in a strained ring.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons. The starting material also has 14 protons.\n    *   This evidence suggests that the two bromine atoms have been replaced and a rearrangement has occurred to form a tricyclic ketone with the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The reaction likely proceeds through elimination/rearrangement/hydrolysis pathways. A plausible structure is an isomer of adamantanone, such as protoadamantan-4-one, but its exact identity is not critical for the next step as long as we know it's a C₁₀H₁₄O ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Analysis:** This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction conditions (heating) must cause both the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol and the subsequent dehydration of that alcohol to form an alkene.\n    *   Ketone (Product 1) → Alcohol → Alkene (Product 2)\n*   The dehydration of adamantane-type alcohols often involves skeletal rearrangements to form more stable alkenes that do not violate Bredt's rule (which disfavors double bonds at a bridgehead carbon). A well-known and stable alkene isomer with the formula C₁₀H₁₄ is **protoadamantene**. Thus, Product 2 is protoadamantene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction. It cleaves the C=C double bond in protoadamantene and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ozonolysis of the double bond in protoadamantene opens one of the rings in the tricyclic system. The product is a bicyclic molecule containing two carbonyl groups. The specific product formed is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one-7-carbaldehyde.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable ones like OH, NH).\n    *   The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is the most deshielded (δ ≈ 9-10 ppm). It is coupled to the single proton on C7, so it would appear as a doublet. Since \"doublet\" is not an option, the question is referring to the most deshielded proton on the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The next most deshielded proton is the one on carbon C7 (H7), which is alpha to the strongly electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. Its chemical shift would be significantly higher than other skeletal protons.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H7:** We need to determine how the signal for H7 is split by its neighboring protons.\n    *   H7 is bonded to C7. The adjacent carbons are C6, C8, C1, and C5.\n    *   H7 is coupled to the two protons on C6 and the two protons on C8.\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system typically exists in a symmetric chair-chair conformation. In this conformation, the two protons on C6 and the two on C8 can be divided into two sets:\n        1.  Two \"axial-like\" protons (one on C6, one on C8).\n        2.  Two \"equatorial-like\" protons (one on C6, one on C8).\n    *   The coupling constant between H7 and the two axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant between H7 and the two equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H7 is first split into a **triplet** by the two equivalent axial-like protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split into another **triplet** by the two equivalent equatorial-like protons.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThe coupling to the distant bridgehead protons is generally much weaker and often not resolved, so it does not affect the primary splitting pattern.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded skeletal hydrogen atom is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
