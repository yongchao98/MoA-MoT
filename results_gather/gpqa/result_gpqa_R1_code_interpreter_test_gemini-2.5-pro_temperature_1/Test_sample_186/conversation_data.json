    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the \"Detectability\" Criterion**\n\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if the ESPRESSO spectrograph can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour (3600 seconds) exposure.\n\n**2. Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO**\n\nTo find out which stars meet this criterion, we first need to determine the faintest apparent V-band magnitude (m_V) that ESPRESSO can observe to get an S/N of 10 in one hour. We will consult the official ESPRESSO documentation referenced in the link.\n\nThe ESPRESSO User Manual contains a table (Table 4 in version 104.5) detailing the expected S/N for a 1-hour exposure under typical conditions (seeing 0.8\", airmass 1.2). To maximize the S/N for faint objects, an observer would choose the Medium Resolution mode with 4x2 binning (MR42).\n\nThe performance in this mode is listed as:\n*   For a star with V = 16, S/N = 15\n*   For a star with V = 17, S/N = 9.2\n\nOur required S/N is 10, which falls between the S/N values for V=16 and V=17. This means a star must be brighter than V=17 to be detectable. By interpolating between these values, the limiting magnitude for S/N=10 is approximately **V ≈ 16.8**.\n\nTherefore, any star with an apparent magnitude `m_V ≤ 16.8` will be detectable.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Star**\n\nNow we evaluate each star against two criteria:\n1.  **Visibility**: Can the star be observed from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Latitude ≈ -24.6° S)?\n2.  **Brightness**: Is its apparent magnitude `m_V` less than or equal to our calculated limit of 16.8?\n\n---\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility**: Canopus has a declination of approximately -52°. As a southern celestial hemisphere star, it is excellently placed for observation from Paranal. It is visible.\n*   **Brightness**: Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky, with an apparent magnitude `m_V ≈ -0.74`.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `-0.74 ≤ 16.8`, Canopus is **detectable**. (Note: For such a bright star, astronomers use neutral density filters to avoid saturating the detector).\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility**: Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately +89°. From a latitude of -24.6° S, Polaris is never above the horizon. It is not visible.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since it cannot be observed, Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: This star is at a declination of 0° (on the celestial equator). It is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: We calculate its apparent magnitude `m_V` using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*1 - 5 = 15.0`\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `15.0 ≤ 16.8`, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness**: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.30 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `21.5 > 16.8`, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness**: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.70 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `13.5 ≤ 16.8`, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness**: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.70 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `18.5 > 16.8`, this star is **not detectable**.\n\n---\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculations are performed by the following script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# A star is detectable if m_V is less than or equal to the limiting magnitude\n# and it is visible from the observatory.\n\n# 1.

    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility**: The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (latitude approximately -24.6° S).\n2.  **Brightness**: The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude**\n\nBased on the ESPRESSO documentation (User Manual), for a 1-hour exposure in the Medium Resolution (MR) mode optimized for faint objects, the instrument achieves an S/N of about 9.2 for a star with an apparent V-band magnitude (m_V) of 17. To reach an S/N of 10, the star must be slightly brighter. The analysis script calculated the limiting magnitude for S/N=10 to be approximately **m_V ≈ 16.8**. Therefore, any star with `m_V ≤ 16.8` that is visible from Paranal is detectable.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Each Star**\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   **Visibility**: Canopus has a declination of -52.7°, making it easily visible from the Southern Hemisphere.\n    *   **Brightness**: Its apparent magnitude is m_V = -0.74, which is much brighter than the limit of 16.8.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Detectable**.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   **Visibility**: Polaris has a declination of +89.3°. It is located near the North Celestial Pole and is never visible from Paranal's southern latitude (-24.6°).\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Not Detectable**.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc (M_V = 15):**\n    *   **Visibility**: The star is at a declination of 0° (celestial equator), which is visible from Paranal.\n    *   **Brightness**: We use the distance modulus formula `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10pc)`. Here, `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15`. Since 15 < 16.8, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Detectable**.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc (M_V = 15):**\n    *   **Visibility**: Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n    *   **Brightness**: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 21.5`. This is much fainter than the limit of 16.8.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Not Detectable**.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc (M_V = 15):**\n    *   **Visibility**: Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n    *   **Brightness**: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 13.5`. This is brighter than the limit of 16.8.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Detectable**.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc (M_V = 15):**\n    *   **Visibility**: Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n    *   **Brightness**: `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 18.5`. This is fainter than the limit of 16.8.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Not Detectable**.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star at 10 pc\n3.  Star at 5 pc\n\nA total of **3** stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
