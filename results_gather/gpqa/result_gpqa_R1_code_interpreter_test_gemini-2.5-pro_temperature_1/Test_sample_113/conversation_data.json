    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (sodium cyanide), and reagent A.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   **Transformation:** The reaction involves the addition of a hydrogen atom to the carbonyl oxygen and a cyanide group (CN) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   `NaHSO3` (Sodium bisulfite) forms a different type of addition product and is not used to complete cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   `H3O⁺` (hydronium ion, representing a strong acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water) is an excellent source of protons. In this type of reaction, the acid is typically added after the initial nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. Therefore, `H3O⁺` is the suitable reagent for A.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reactants:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile), reagent B, and water (H₂O).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile functional group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires either a strong acid or a strong base as a catalyst, typically with heating. The water molecule acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is not efficient. Strong acids are required for practical hydrolysis.\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A for the cyanohydrin formation is a proton source, `H3O⁺`.\n    *   Reagent B for the nitrile hydrolysis is a strong acid catalyst, `HCl`.\n    *   Combining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = `H3O⁺` and B = `HCl`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
