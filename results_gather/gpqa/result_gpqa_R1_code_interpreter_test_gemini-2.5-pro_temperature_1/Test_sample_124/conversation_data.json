    "This problem concerns the quantum mechanical model of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n**1. Finding the Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved most easily by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\nThe Hamiltonian operator is:\n$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}) + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\nThis Hamiltonian is separable into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are well-known:\n$E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the $i$-th dimension.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2. Identifying the Third Excited State's Energy**\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.\n*   **Ground State:** $N = 0$. This is the lowest energy state.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** $N = 1$. This is the next energy level up.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** $N = 2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** $N = 3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Finding the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of ways to distribute $N$ identical items into $k$ distinct bins is given by the formula $\\binom{N+k-1}{k-1}$.\nIn our case, $N=3$ (quanta of energy) and $k=3$ (the x, y, and z dimensions).\nThe degeneracy $g_N$ is:\n$g_N = \\binom{N+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{N+2}{2} = \\frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state ($N=3$):\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$\n\nTherefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nWe can also list the combinations explicitly:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n*   (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) — 1 state\nTotal number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option C. The other options have incorrect energy expressions (A and B are for a particle in a spherical box) or incorrect degeneracy (D).\n\nTo confirm this, I will use a simple Python script to calculate the values.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the principal quantum number for the third excited state\n# N=0 is ground state, N=1 is 1st excited, N=2 is 2nd excited, N=3 is 3rd excited.\nN = 3\n\n# Energy of the N-th level is E_N = (N + 3/2) * hbar * omega\nenergy_factor = N + 1.5\n\n# Degeneracy of the N-th level is g_N = (N+2)(N+1)/2\ndegeneracy = (N + 2) * (N + 1) / 2\n\nprint(f\"The energy of the third excited state (N={N}) is ({energy_factor})*hbar*omega.\")\nprint(f\"The degeneracy of this state is {int(degeneracy)}.\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Set up the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The Hamiltonian for a particle of mass $m$ in this potential is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\n    In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ and $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$. The Hamiltonian becomes:\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2z^2\\right)$\n    This shows that the 3D harmonic oscillator is equivalent to three independent 1D harmonic oscillators.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels correspond to different values of $N$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $N = 0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N = 1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N = 3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to have $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    We can list the possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3). This gives 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0: (2, 1, 0). The permutations are (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2). This gives 6 states.\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1, 1, 1). This gives 1 state.\n    The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_N$ for a level $N$ can be calculated using the formula:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$\n    For $N=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option C.\n\nThe initial code query produced the following output, confirming the calculations:\n`The energy of the third excited state (N=3) is (4.5)*hbar*omega.`\n`The degeneracy of this state is 10.`\nThis matches the derived energy of $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
