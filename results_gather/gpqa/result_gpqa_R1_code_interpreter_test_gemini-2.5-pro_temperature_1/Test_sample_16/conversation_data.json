    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and reaction.**\n    The problem involves the calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$), free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$), and the EDTA ligand (represented as $Y^{4-}$ at ideal pH). The complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions. The formation reaction is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the given constants.**\n    *   Initial concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, $[CaY^{2-}]_{initial}$ = 0.02 M. This means we start with a solution of the complex, which will then slightly dissociate.\n    *   The formation constant (or stability constant), $K_f$ (also denoted as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$. The expression for the formation constant is:\n        $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **Set up the equilibrium problem.**\n    Since we start with the complex, it's easier to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n4.  **Use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track concentrations.**\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every mole of $CaY^{2-}$ that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $Y^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :---------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n5.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve the equation for x.**\n    Because the formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, and therefore 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can make the simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Take the square root to find x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n7.  **Interpret the result.**\n    The value 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    So, $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n8.  **Check the approximation.**\n    Is $x \\ll 0.02$? Yes, $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ is much smaller than $0.02$, so our approximation was valid.\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated concentration $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M matches option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\ninitial_complex_concentration = 0.02  # M\nformation_constant_Kf = 5e10\n\n# The equilibrium expression is Kf = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# We approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 because Kf is very large\n# So, Kf ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n# This leads to x^2 ≈ 0.02 / Kf\n# x is the concentration of Ca^2+ ions\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_concentration / formation_constant_Kf\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The result 'x' is the concentration of calcium ions\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n>>>\n6.32e-07 M\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** We are given a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is denoted as $[CaY^{2-}]$. This complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and the EDTA ligand ($Y^{4-}$). The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium. We assume an \"ideal pH,\" which means the EDTA is fully deprotonated to $Y^{4-}$, and we don't need to consider any side reactions involving protons.\n\n2.  **Write the Equilibrium Reaction:** The formation of the complex is given by:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction ($K_f$) is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Since we start with the complex and want to find how much of it dissociates, it is helpful to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n    Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. According to the stoichiometry, for every mole of $CaY^{2-}$ that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $Y^{4-}$ are formed. We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$     | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant ($K_f$) expression:\n\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x (the concentration of Ca²⁺):** The value of $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), which indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can make a simplifying approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n6.  **Final Result:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Check the Answer against Options:**\n    A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D. The previous Python code execution also confirmed this result (`6.32e-07 M`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
