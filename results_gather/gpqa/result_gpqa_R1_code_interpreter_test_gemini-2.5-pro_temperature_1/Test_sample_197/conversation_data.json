    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n### **1. Identify Species and Equilibria**\n\nThe relevant species in the solution are:\n*   Free cobalt(II) ion: `Co^2+`\n*   Thiocyanate ion: `SCN-`\n*   Complexes: `[Co(SCN)]+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]-`, `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the following equilibria, with their given overall stability constants (β):\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n### **2. Define Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of all species containing cobalt:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free `[Co^2+]` concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Mole Fraction**\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α2`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\n`α2 = (β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n`α2 = (β2[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n### **4. Assumption for Ligand Concentration**\n\nWe are given the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M` and the total thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]_total = 0.1 M`. Since the concentration of the ligand (`SCN-`) is 10 times greater than the concentration of the metal ion (`Co^2+`), the amount of `SCN-` that is bound in complexes will be relatively small compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can make the reasonable approximation that the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, `[SCN-]`, is equal to its initial total concentration.\n`[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n### **5. Calculation**\n\nNow we can substitute the given values into the mole fraction equation. Let `L = [SCN-] = 0.1 M`.\n\n*   **Numerator**: `β2 * L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator**: `1 + β1*L + β2*L^2 + β3*L^3 + β4*L^4`\n    *   `β1*L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2*L^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3*L^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4*L^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Mole Fraction**: `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Given values for the stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given concentration of thiocyanate, assumed to be the equilibrium concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Numerator for the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)2] is beta2 * L^2\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Denominator is the sum of terms for all species\n# Sum = 1 (for Co2+) + beta1*L + beta2*L^2 + beta3*L^3 + beta4*L^4\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the mole fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution. The percentage is this mole fraction multiplied by 100.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria:**\n\nThe species containing cobalt are the free ion `Co^2+` and the complexes `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n**2. Use stability constants to express concentrations:**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN^-]`).\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nWe can factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3. Calculate the mole fraction (α) of the target complex:**\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α2`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from above:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels, simplifying the equation:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**4. Approximate the free ligand concentration:**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is `0.01 M`, while the thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is 10 times greater than the metal ion concentration, we can assume that the amount of ligand bound in complexes is small compared to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, `[SCN^-]`, is approximately equal to its initial total concentration.\n`[SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**5. Perform the calculation:**\n\nNow we plug in the known values:\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n`Numerator = β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β1 * [SCN^-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n*   `β3 * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n*   `β4 * [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\nSum the denominator:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nCalculate the mole fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nConvert to percentage:\n`Percentage = α2 * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThis value matches option D. The calculation confirms that approximately 16.9% of the cobalt is present as the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\nThe previous python code execution confirms this result.\n<<<D>>>"
