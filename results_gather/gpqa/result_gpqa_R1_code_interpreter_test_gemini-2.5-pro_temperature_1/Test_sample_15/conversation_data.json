    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality, such as chiral centers, and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is built around a C=C double bond. All atoms directly involved in the double bond and the atoms attached to them lie in a single plane.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms with four different substituents) in this molecule.\n    *   The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides specific stereochemical information: (3aR, 7aS, E).\n    *   The 'R' and 'S' descriptors indicate the absolute configuration at specific chiral centers (C-3a and C-7a). The 'E' descriptor specifies the geometry of the double bond.\n    *   A compound for which a specific single stereoisomer (an enantiomer or a diastereomer) is named is, by definition, chiral and optically active, unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   Given the complexity and low symmetry of the described structure, it is not a meso compound. The presence of the specific stereodescriptors confirms it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group.\n    *   For molecules with two identical chiral centers, the stereoisomer with (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is a **meso compound**.\n    *   A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In its staggered conformation, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound.\n    *   It has two chiral centers with the (2R,3R) configuration.\n    *   This stereoisomer is one of a pair of enantiomers; its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. These two are non-superimposable.\n    *   It does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral compound and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-CH2-.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The (R) designation specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the relative stereochemistry where the three -OH groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (the *cis,cis* isomer).\n    *   Let's consider the molecule with the -OH groups all pointing 'up'. This molecule has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   It possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group on the ring.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral, even though C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, it is a meso compound and **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, which means a 4-carbon chain with the carbonyl group at C1. A methyl group is at C3, and a cyclopentyl group is at C1.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. This can also be named isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers in this structure.\n    *   The carbon `C3` is attached to a `-H`, a `-CH3` (the C4 of the chain), another `-CH3` (the substituent), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group. Wait, this interpretation is wrong. The name \"3-methylbutan-1-one\" implies a butane chain `(C4)-(C3)-(C2)-(C1)` with a methyl on C3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. Let's re-examine C3. The four groups attached to C3 are: 1) H, 2) CH3 (substituent), 3) C4 (which is a CH3 group), 4) C2 (part of the longer chain). So two of the groups are methyl.\n    *   A more standard interpretation of the name is based on the isobutyl group. `3-methylbutanoyl` corresponds to the isovaleroyl group, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-`. Attaching a cyclopentyl group gives `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   In this structure, no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other sp3 carbons are CH2 groups or part of the symmetric cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has no chiral center and is achiral. It is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n```python\n# Create a list of booleans representing the optical activity of each compound.\n# True for optically active, False for not.\noptical_activity = [\n    False,  # (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene (achiral)\n    True,   # (3aR,7aS,E)-8...

    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The key to determining optical activity is to check for chirality. A molecule is generally chiral if it contains one or more chiral centers and does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is built around a C=C double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule. There are no chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself provides specific stereochemical information. The `(3aR,7aS)` part indicates the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. The `(E)` part specifies the geometry of the double bond. When a compound is named as a specific, single stereoisomer (not a racemic mixture), it is chiral and optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound. This complex structure is highly unlikely to be meso. Therefore, this specific enantiomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3, which are identically substituted. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a specific stereoisomer. For molecules with two identical chiral centers, the (R,S) or (S,R) isomer is a **meso compound**. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is one of a pair of enantiomers (its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer). As a single enantiomer, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1. The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. The `(R)` designation specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the relative stereochemistry where the three -OH groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (the *cis,cis,cis* isomer). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group on the ring. Due to the presence of these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral (a meso compound). Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure can be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents). In this molecule, there are no such carbons. The carbon in the `(CH3)2CH` group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All other sp3 carbons are part of CH2 groups or a symmetric cyclopentyl ring (in its time-averaged conformation). The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\nIn summary, the optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis gives a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n```python\n# This script formalizes the counting based on the chemical analysis.\n# True represents an optically active compound.\n# False represents an optically inactive (achiral) compound.\n\nanalysis_results = [\n    False,  # 1.

    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers) and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nLet's evaluate each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. This molecule is planar around the carbon-carbon double bond. This plane of the molecule is a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single stereoisomer with defined absolute configurations (`3aR`, `7aS`) at its chiral centers. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex bridged structure lacks any internal symmetry elements that would make it an achiral meso compound. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two identically substituted chiral centers (at C2 and C3). The `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer has a center of inversion when in the staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in the eclipsed conformation. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule and exists as one of a pair of enantiomers (its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer). Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: In this molecule, the carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and a `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. The `(R)` designation indicates we are considering a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all *cis*). This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We examine the molecule for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the isopropyl group `(CH(CH3)2)` is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other sp3 carbons with four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (Yes)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (Yes)\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>"
