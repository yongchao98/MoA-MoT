    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the possible types of radiation\nThe source is an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. Such a source radiates electromagnetic waves. The nature of the radiation is determined by the lowest-order non-zero time-varying multipole moment. The two most common types are electric dipole and electric quadrupole radiation.\n\n*   **Electric Dipole Radiation:** This occurs if the center of charge oscillates. For an oscillation along the z-axis, we have a time-varying electric dipole moment **p**(t). This is the lowest order and typically the dominant form of radiation if the dipole moment is non-zero.\n*   **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** This occurs if the charge distribution changes shape in a way that creates a time-varying quadrupole moment, even if the dipole moment remains zero. A classic example is a spherical or spheroidal body that oscillates between prolate (cigar-like) and oblate (pancake-like) shapes. Given the problem specifies a \"spheroid\" shape that is \"oscillating\", it's plausible to interpret this as shape oscillations, which are quadrupolar in nature. In many such physical systems (like an oscillating nucleus), the center of mass is fixed, making the dipole moment zero and the quadrupole moment the dominant source of radiation.\n\nWe must analyze both possibilities.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe radiated power per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, has a characteristic dependence on the angle `θ` with the z-axis for each type of radiation.\n\n*   **Case 1: Electric Dipole Radiation**\n    The power radiated per unit solid angle is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    The maximum power `A` occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`.\n    So, `A` is proportional to `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    The power at `θ = 30°` is proportional to `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\n*   **Case 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation**\n    For the simplest type of axial quadrupole oscillation (like a spheroid deforming along its z-axis), the power radiated per unit solid angle is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n    To find the maximum power `A`, we need to find the maximum value of the function `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`.\n    We can rewrite this as `g(θ) = (1/4) * (2sin(θ)cos(θ))² = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`.\n    The maximum value of `g(θ)` occurs when `sin²(2θ) = 1`, which happens at `2θ = 90°`, or `θ = 45°`.\n    The maximum value is `g(45°) = 1/4`. So, the maximum power `A` is proportional to 1/4.\n    Now, we calculate the value at `θ = 30°`:\n    `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`.\n    The power at `θ = 30°` is proportional to 3/16.\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = (3/16) / (1/4) = 12/16 = 3/4.\n\nTo confirm this calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Case 1: Electric Dipole\ntheta_30_rad = np.deg2rad(30)\ntheta_90_rad = np.deg2rad(90)\ndipole_fraction = np.sin(theta_30_rad)**2 / np.sin(theta_90_rad)**2\nprint(f\"Dipole Fraction: {dipole_fraction}\")\n\n# Case 2: Electric Quadrupole\ntheta_45_rad = np.deg2rad(45)\nquadrupole_term_30 = (np.sin(theta_30_rad)**2) * (np.cos(theta_30_rad)**2)\nquadrupole_term_max = (np.sin(theta_45_rad)**2) * (np.cos(theta_45_rad)**2)\nquadrupole_fraction = quadrupole_term_30 / quadrupole_term_max\nprint(f\"Quadrupole Fraction: {quadrupole_fraction}\")\n```\n[execution result]\nDipole Fraction: 0.25\nQuadrupole Fraction: 0.75\n\n### 3. Analyze the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe total radiated power `P` (and thus the power per unit solid angle `f = dP/dΩ`) depends on the oscillation frequency `ω` as `P ∝ ω^(2l+2)` for a multipole of order `l`. The wavelength `λ` is related to `ω` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, so `ω ∝ 1/λ`.\n\n*   **Case 1: Electric Dipole Radiation (`l=1`)**\n    `P ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    So, the function `f` has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n    This case corresponds to a fraction of 1/4 and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`. This matches option B.\n\n*   **Case 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation (`l=2`)**\n    `P ∝ ω⁶ ∝ (1/λ)⁶ = λ⁻⁶`.\n    So, the function `f` has a `λ⁻⁶` dependence.\n    This case corresponds to a fraction of 3/4 and a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁶`. This matches option A.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nWe have two possible scenarios leading to options A and B. The choice depends on the most plausible physical interpretation of an \"oscillating spheroid\".\n\n1.  The specific mention of the \"spheroid\" shape suggests that the geometry is important.\n2.  An oscillation of the shape of a charged body (e.g., a spheroid pulsating between more and less elongated forms) is a classic model for electric quadrupole radiation, especially if the center of charge is assumed to be fixed (leading to zero dipole moment).\n3.  If the problem intended simple dipole radiation, a less specific description like \"an oscillating charge\" would have been sufficient. The added detail \"spheroid in shape\" strongly hints that the shape's role is central, pointing towards quadrupole radiation.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the system is dominated by electric quadrupole radiation.\n\n*   Fraction of maximum power at 30° = **3/4**\n*   Possible form of `f` includes a dependence of **λ⁻⁶**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine the nature of electromagnetic radiation from an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution and then calculate two quantities: the radiated power at a specific angle relative to the maximum, and the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Type of Radiation\n\nThe source is described as an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape\" with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. This description can correspond to two primary types of radiation, depending on how it oscillates:\n\n1.  **Electric Dipole Radiation:** If the center of charge of the spheroid oscillates up and down the z-axis, it creates a time-varying electric dipole moment **p**(t). This is often the dominant form of radiation.\n2.  **Electric Quadrupole Radiation:** If the spheroid oscillates in shape (e.g., pulsating between a more prolate and a more oblate shape) while its center of charge remains fixed, its electric dipole moment is zero. The lowest-order non-zero time-varying moment would be the electric quadrupole moment. The specific mention of a \"spheroid\" shape makes this a very strong possibility, as shape oscillations are a key feature of such systems.\n\nWe will analyze both cases.\n\n### Step 2: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, has a distinct angular dependence for each multipole order. Let this be `f(θ, λ)`.\n\n*   **Case 1: Electric Dipole Radiation (oscillating along z-axis)**\n    The power per unit solid angle is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    The maximum power, `A`, occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value is 1, at `θ = 90°`.\n    `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n    At `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to:\n    `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / A = (1/4) / 1 = **1/4**\n\n*   **Case 2: Electric Quadrupole Radiation (axial symmetry)**\n    For an oscillating spheroid with its symmetry axis along z, the power per unit solid angle is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`\n    To find the maximum power, `A`, we find the maximum of `g(θ) = sin²(θ)cos²(θ)`. Using the identity `sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ)`, we have:\n    `g(θ) = (1/4)sin²(2θ)`\n    The maximum value of `sin²(2θ)` is 1, which occurs when `2θ = 90°`, so `θ = 45°`.\n    The maximum power `A` is proportional to `g(45°) = 1/4`.\n    At `θ = 30°`, the function value is:\n    `g(30°) = sin²(30°)cos²(30°) = (1/2)² * (√3/2)² = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16`\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / A = (3/16) / (1/4) = **3/4**\n\n### Step 3: Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe total radiated power `P` (and thus `dP/dΩ`) for a multipole of order `l` depends on the angular frequency `ω` as `P ∝ ω^(2l+2)`. Since wavelength `λ` is inversely proportional to frequency (`λ = 2πc/ω`), the power dependence on wavelength is `P ∝ (1/λ)^(2l+2) = λ^(-2l-2)`.\n\n*   **Case 1: Electric Dipole (l=1)**\n    `P ∝ λ^(-2*1-2) = λ⁻⁴`\n    So, for this case, `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`.\n\n*   **Case 2: Electric Quadrupole (l=2)**\n    `P ∝ λ^(-2*2-2) = λ⁻⁶`\n    So, for this case, `f ∝ λ⁻⁶`.\n\n### Step 4: Combine Results and Conclude\n\nWe have two self-consistent scenarios:\n1.  **Dipole:** Fraction = 1/4, Wavelength dependence = λ⁻⁴. This matches option **B**.\n2.  **Quadrupole:** Fraction = 3/4, Wavelength dependence = λ⁻⁶. This matches option **A**.\n\nThe deciding factor is the most plausible physical interpretation of an \"oscillating spheroid\". The explicit mention of the object's shape (\"spheroid\") strongly suggests that the oscillation involves the shape itself, which is a classic source of electric quadrupole radiation. If the problem intended simple dipole radiation, a simpler description like \"an oscillating charge\" or \"an oscillating dipole\" would have been more appropriate. Therefore, the quadrupole model is the better fit for the problem statement.\n\nBased on the quadrupole radiation model:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **3/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence in `f` is **λ⁻⁶**.\n\nThese two results correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
