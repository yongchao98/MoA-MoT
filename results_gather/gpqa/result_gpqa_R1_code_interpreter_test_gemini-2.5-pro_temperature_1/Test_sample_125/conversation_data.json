    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, provided as a single enantiomer. The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃, with the stereocenter at carbon 5 having the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the carbonyl group at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3. Since the starting material is chiral, the environment of the reaction is chiral. The hydride (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are generally formed in unequal amounts in such a reaction.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of two ketone groups with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). NaBH₄ will reduce both carbonyls to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Since the starting material is achiral, the overall product mixture must be optically inactive.\n*   **Products:** Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a **racemic mixture**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry (and is identical to the (2S, 4R) structure). This makes it an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of both the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds in total: two diastereomers from Reaction I and three stereoisomers (a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers) from Reaction II.\n\n*   **Principle of Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, such as the two products from Reaction I, have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **two peaks**.\n    *   The meso diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair from the same reaction. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives one peak for the meso compound and one peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair. This is **two peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols), so they will be well-separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** We sum the separable groups:\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n    *   Peak 4: (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (co-eluting enantiomers)\n\nThus, we observe **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:** A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks:** We count each unique stereoisomer in the 5-component mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1 from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2 from Rxn I) -> **1 peak**\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 1 from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer 2 from Rxn II) -> **1 peak**\n\nSince all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column can resolve both diastereomers and enantiomers, we expect to see **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC (assuming ideal separation with no accidental co-elution).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
