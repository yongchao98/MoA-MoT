    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A):**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is an equilibrium between two structural isomers, called tautomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an **alpha-hydrogen**. An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n        *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Since there are **no alpha-hydrogens**, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they have **two alpha-hydrogens**.\n        *   The presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens allows this compound to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which in this case is the highly stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B):**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is **chiral** if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different groups**.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry that includes all the atoms.\n        *   It does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n        *   Because it is a planar, symmetrical molecule (achiral), it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
