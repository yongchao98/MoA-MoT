    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to compare two distinct energy values related to a Hydrogen atom:\n1.  **The Paramagnetic Coupling Term (`<H>`)**: This is the energy shift of an atomic energy level when the atom is placed in an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n2.  **The Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**: This is the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed when an electron in a Hydrogen atom transitions between two energy levels. This energy is given by the photon's wavelength.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   Magnetic field strength, `B = 1 T`.\n*   The field is parallel to the z-axis.\n*   We should consider \"small values\" of the orbital magnetic quantum number, `m`. We will use `m = 1` for this calculation, as it represents the smallest non-zero value, providing the fundamental scale of the interaction.\n*   The wavelength of the transition, `λ = 0.4861 μm`.\n\n### **2. Calculating the Paramagnetic Coupling Term (`<H>`)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of the atom's orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field `B` is:\n$H = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment `μ_L` is related to the orbital angular momentum `L` by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}$\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nSince the magnetic field is along the z-axis ($\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$), the dot product simplifies to:\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThe energy shift, which is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian, is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z \\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle$\n\nThe expectation value of `L_z` is `mħ`, where `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\left( \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\right) B$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton (`μ_B`)**:\n$\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$\n\nThus, the energy shift is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nUsing the given values `B = 1 T` and `m = 1`:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### **3. Calculating the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` is Planck's constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength.\n\nA very useful value in atomic physics is the product `hc`, which is approximately `1240 eV·nm`.\n\nFirst, we convert the given wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.551 \\text{ eV}$\n\n### **4. Comparing the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.551 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio of the two energies:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.551 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number (on the order of 10⁻⁵). This means the energy from the paramagnetic coupling in a 1T magnetic field is many orders of magnitude smaller than the typical energy difference between electronic states in a Hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\nTo verify the precision of this calculation, we can use a Python script with more precise constants.\n```python\n# Constants in SI units and eV\nh_ev_s = 4.135667696e-15  # Planck's constant in eV*s\nc_m_s = 299792458         # Speed of light in m/s\nmu_B_ev_T = 5.7883382528e-5 # Bohr magneton in eV/T\n\n# Given values\nB_T = 1.0               # Magnetic field in Tesla\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6    # Wavelength in meters\nm = 1                   # Orbital magnetic quantum number\n\n# 1.

    "The code execution has confirmed the initial reasoning and calculations.\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n1.  **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**: This is the energy shift due to the external magnetic field (Zeeman effect).\n    *   Formula: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n    *   Calculation: For $m=1$ and $B=1$ T, the energy is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV. The code output confirms this with a value of `5.7884e-05 eV`.\n\n2.  **Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy of a photon with the given wavelength.\n    *   Formula: $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n    *   Calculation: For $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1$ nm, the energy is $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55$ eV. The code output confirms this with a value of `2.5506 eV`.\n\n### **Comparison**\n\nTo compare the two energy values, we look at their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.7884 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.5506 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.2694 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is a very small number, approximately 1/44,000. This demonstrates that the paramagnetic coupling energy is several orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis means the energy splitting caused by a 1 Tesla magnetic field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy difference between the atomic levels involved in the visible light transition.\n\n<<<D>>>"
