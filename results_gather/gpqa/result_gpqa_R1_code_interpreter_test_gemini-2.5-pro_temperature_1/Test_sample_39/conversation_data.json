    "The user is asking for the meaning of a common phrase used in a synthetic organic chemistry lab.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** The conversation happens between two synthetic organic chemists. One reports a bad outcome from their work, stating their \"compounds are on top of each other.\" This phrase is lab jargon describing a situation where the chemist is unable to separate two or more different chemical compounds.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the primary separation technique:** The most common method for purifying compounds in a synthetic organic chemistry lab is column chromatography (or its analytical counterpart, thin-layer chromatography, TLC). This technique separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (e.g., silica gel) and a mobile phase (an eluting solvent).\n\n3.  **Relate the technique to the options:**\n    *   The key physical property that governs separation in normal-phase chromatography is **polarity**. Compounds with different polarities will interact differently with the polar stationary phase (silica gel). More polar compounds stick more strongly and move more slowly, while less polar compounds move more quickly.\n    *   If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will move at nearly the same rate through the chromatography column. This means they will elute from the column at the same time (co-elute) and end up in the same collected fractions.\n    *   When analyzing the separation using TLC, the compounds would appear as spots with the same or very similar retention factor (Rf value), meaning the spots would be literally \"on top of each other\" or merged into a single, unresolvable spot. This indicates a failed separation.\n\n4.  **Consider the other options:**\n    *   **A) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used to characterize a purified chiral compound. It is not a basis for a common separation technique. A chemist would measure this *after* a successful purification.\n    *   **C) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult. While possible, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of spots on a TLC plate than fractions from a distillation. Chromatography is a far more common purification technique for the complex molecules often made in synthetic organic labs than distillation.\n    *   **D) Non-covalent interactions:** While these forces are the basis for how chromatography works (interactions between the analyte and the stationary phase), the statement itself is a description of the *outcome* of the separation, not the underlying principle. The chemist is complaining that the compounds' properties are too similar for the technique to work, not simply stating that the compounds are interacting.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a direct and common reference to a failed chromatographic separation (either on a TLC plate or a column). The underlying reason for this failure is that the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
