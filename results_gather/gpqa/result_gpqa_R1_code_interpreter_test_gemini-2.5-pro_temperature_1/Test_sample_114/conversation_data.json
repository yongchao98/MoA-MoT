    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conservation Laws\n\nThe problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation process. The fundamental principles we need to apply are the conservation of total energy and the conservation of total momentum.\n\n*   **System Before Collision:** An electron and a positron moving towards each other.\n*   **System After Collision:** Two photons.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final}$ (This is a vector equation, so we'll consider x and y components).\n\nWe'll set the direction of the electron's motion as the positive x-axis.\n\n### 2. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum\n\nThe total energy and momentum of a particle with rest mass $m$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ are given by:\n*   Energy: $E = \\gamma m c^2$\n*   Momentum magnitude: $p$, where $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. This can be rearranged to find momentum: $p = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\gamma mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{c} = m c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\nLet $m_e$ be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron. The rest energy is $E_{rest} = m_e c^2$.\n\n**Electron:**\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_e = 4$\n*   Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$\n*   Momentum (in the +x direction):\n    $p_e = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{15}$\n    $\\vec{p}_e = (\\sqrt{15} m_e c, 0)$\n\n**Positron:**\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_p = 2$\n*   Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n*   Momentum (in the -x direction):\n    $p_p = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = m_e c \\sqrt{3}$\n    $\\vec{p}_p = (-\\sqrt{3} m_e c, 0)$\n\n**Total Initial State:**\n*   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$\n*   Total Momentum: $\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_p = ((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c, 0)$\n\n### 3. Describe the Final State (Two Photons)\n\nThe final state consists of two photons. For a photon, the energy $E_\\gamma$ and momentum $p_\\gamma$ are related by $E_\\gamma = p_\\gamma c$.\n\n*   The problem states the two photons have equal energy. Let's call this energy $E_\\gamma$.\n*   One photon moves upper-right, and the other lower-right. This means they move symmetrically with respect to the x-axis. Let $\\theta$ be the angle of the first photon's direction with the x-axis, and $-\\theta$ be the angle for the second photon.\n\n**Photon 1:**\n*   Energy: $E_{\\gamma1} = E_\\gamma$\n*   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} = (\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta, \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin\\theta)$\n\n**Photon 2:**\n*   Energy: $E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$\n*   Momentum vector: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma2} = (\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos(-\\theta), \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin(-\\theta)) = (\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta, -\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin\\theta)$\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation Laws to Find the Angle\n\n**Energy Conservation:**\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$6 m_e c^2 = E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma + E_\\gamma = 2 E_\\gamma$\n$E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$\nSo, each photon has an energy of $3 m_e c^2$.\n\n**Momentum Conservation:**\n$\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma1} + \\vec{p}_{\\gamma2}$\n\n*   **y-component:**\n    $p_{initial, y} = p_{final, y}$\n    $0 = \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin\\theta - \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\sin\\theta = 0$. This confirms our assumption of symmetric angles.\n\n*   **x-component:**\n    $p_{initial, x} = p_{final, x}$\n    $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta + \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta = 2 \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\cos\\theta$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} \\cos\\theta$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta$\n\nWe can cancel $m_e c$ from both sides:\n$\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n\nSolving for $\\cos\\theta$:\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Numerical Value\n\nWe can now calculate the value of $\\theta$ and then the total angle between the photons, which is $2\\theta$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_theta))\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2*theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(f\"Angle of one photon with the x-axis (theta): {theta_deg:.2f} degrees\")\nprint(f\"Total angle between the two photons (2*theta): {total_angle:.2f} degrees\")\n```\n>>>\nAngle of one photon with the x-axis (theta): 69.09 degrees\nTotal angle between the two photons (2*theta): 138.19 degrees\n>>>\nThe total angle between the direction of the two photons is approximately 138.19 degrees.

The positron is then moving in the negative x-axis direction.\n\n### 2. Calculate Initial Energy and Momentum\n\nFor a particle with rest mass $m$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$, its total energy $E$ and momentum magnitude $p$ are given by:\n*   Energy: $E = \\gamma m c^2$\n*   Momentum: The energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.
