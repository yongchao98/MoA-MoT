    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same photometric signal as the described starspots, we must first calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then equate it to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### 1. Brightness Variation from Starspots\n\nThe change in a star's brightness due to spots is determined by the temperature difference between the stellar surface and the spots, and the fraction of the surface covered by these spots. The energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Star's effective temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling factor (f) on one hemisphere = 20% or 0.20\n\nThe maximum observed flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the hemisphere with spots is in view. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative difference between these two fluxes.\n\nThe formula for the amplitude of this variation is:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177\nAmplitude ≈ 0.1035 or 10.35%\n\n### 2. Dimming from an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming of a star's light caused by a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nTo find the exoplanet radius that would produce the same signal, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude of the starspot variation:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.1035\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>"
