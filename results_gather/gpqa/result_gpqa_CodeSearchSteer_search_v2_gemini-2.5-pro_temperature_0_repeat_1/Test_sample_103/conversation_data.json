    "The analysis of the relationship between the periodic wavelength shift of a spectral line and the orbital period of an exoplanet reveals that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nThe radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it is gravitationally pulled by the orbiting planet. The magnitude of this wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude is related to the planet's mass (Mp), the star's mass (M*), and the orbital period (P). The formula can be expressed as:\n\nK ∝ (Mp / M*^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3)\n\nIn this specific case, both stars have the same mass (M*1 = M*2), and both planets have similar masses (Mp1 ≈ Mp2). Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means that the radial velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Since the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to K, we have:\n\nΔλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nWe can set up a ratio for the two planetary systems:\n\n(Δλ2 / Δλ1) = (P2 / P1)^(-1/3) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nGiven the wavelength shifts for planet #1 (Δλ1 = 5 miliangstrom) and planet #2 (Δλ2 = 7 miliangstrom), we can solve for the ratio of their orbital periods (P2 / P1):\n\n(7 / 5) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nTo find P2 / P1, we first cube both sides of the equation to solve for P1 / P2:\n\nP1 / P2 = (7 / 5)^3 = 343 / 125 = 2.744\n\nThen, we take the reciprocal to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1:\n\nP2 / P1 = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>"
