    "The initial analysis was correct. The probability of a transit for a planet in a circular orbit is proportional to the stellar radius divided by the planet's semi-major axis (P_transit ∝ R_s / a). Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the stellar mass (P² ∝ a³ / M_s). This can be rearranged to show that the semi-major axis is proportional to the cube root of the stellar mass times the period squared (a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)).\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of the transit probabilities:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship for the semi-major axis:**\n    Based on Kepler's Third Law, we can establish a proportionality for the semi-major axis (a) of each planet:\n    *   a₁ ∝ (M_s1 * P₁²)^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ ∝ (M_s2 * P₂²)^(1/3)\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:**\n    By dividing the expression for a₁ by that for a₂, we get:\n    a₁ / a₂ = [(M_s1 * P₁²) / (M_s2 * P₂²)]^(1/3)\n\n3.  **Substitute the known values:**\n    We are given that the mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2 (M_s1 = 2 * M_s2) and that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (P₁ = P₂ / 3). Substituting these into the equation:\n    a₁ / a₂ = [(2 * M_s2 * (P₂ / 3)²) / (M_s2 * P₂²)]^(1/3)\n    a₁ / a₂ = [(2 * M_s2 * P₂² / 9) / (M_s2 * P₂²)]^(1/3)\n    a₁ / a₂ = (2 / 9)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Define the relationship for transit probability:**\n    The probability of a transit (P_transit) is proportional to the stellar radius (R_s) divided by the semi-major axis (a):\n    *   P_transit1 ∝ R_s1 / a₁\n    *   P_transit2 ∝ R_s2 / a₂\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities:**\n    Dividing the probability for Planet_1 by that for Planet_2 gives:\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_s1 / a₁) / (R_s2 / a₂) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a₂ / a₁)\n\n6.  **Substitute the known values:**\n    We are told that both host stars have the same radii (R_s1 = R_s2). Therefore, the ratio of the radii is 1. The ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁) is the inverse of what we calculated in step 3:\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = 1 * (1 / (2 / 9)^(1/3))\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 ≈ 1.65\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This means the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
