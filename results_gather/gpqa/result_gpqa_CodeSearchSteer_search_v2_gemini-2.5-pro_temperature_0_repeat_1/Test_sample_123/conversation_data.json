    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to determine the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nThe phenomenon described involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on decaying particles. The number of particles that survive after a certain time follows an exponential decay law. Because these particles are traveling at ultra-relativistic speeds, their internal \"clock\" runs slower relative to the observer in the lab (the detector). This time dilation effect extends their lifetime in the lab's frame of reference, allowing them to travel farther before decaying.\n\nThe fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after traveling a distance *L* in the detector is given by the formula:\n\nN/N₀ = exp( -L / (γ * v * τ) )\n\nWhere:\n*   *L* is the distance traveled (the detector radius, 30 m).\n*   *γ* (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   *v* is the particle's velocity. Since it's ultra-relativistic, we can approximate *v* with the speed of light, *c*.\n*   *τ* (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\nThe survival probability can thus be written as:\n\nP(γ) = exp( -L / (γ * c * τ) )\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Condition\n\nFirst, we use the information given for the initial scenario to find the value of the constant term *c*τ (the product of the speed of light and the particle's proper lifetime).\n\n*   **Lorentz factor (γ₁):** ~20\n*   **Fraction of surviving particles (P₁):** 1/3\n*   **Detector radius (L):** 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into the survival probability equation:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 * cτ) )\n\nTo solve for *c*τ, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for *c*τ gives:\n\ncτ = 1.5 / ln(3)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Required Lorentz Factor\n\nNow, we use the desired condition to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂).\n\n*   **Desired fraction of surviving particles (P₂):** 2/3\n*   **Detector radius (L):** 30 m\n*   **New Lorentz factor (γ₂):** To be determined\n\nUsing the same survival probability equation:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30 / (γ₂ * cτ) )\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for *c*τ that we found in Step 1:\n\nln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))\nln(1.5) = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)\nln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nFinally, we solve for γ₂:\n\nγ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo have about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls, a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 is needed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
