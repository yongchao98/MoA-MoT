    "The reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol functional group. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. This process, known as the Williamson ether synthesis, converts the hydroxymethyl group into a benzyloxymethyl group. The product of this step, **Product 1**, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\nProduct 1, a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). The ketone undergoes a condensation reaction with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The product of this step, **Product 2**, is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\nProduct 2 is treated with two equivalents of n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), a strong base, at low temperature, followed by an aqueous workup. This is a Shapiro reaction. The n-butyllithium deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, which forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene. This reaction effectively removes the ketone oxygen and creates a carbon-carbon double bond in the ring. The product of this step, **Product 3**, is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\nProduct 3 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere. This reaction has two effects. First, it reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds. This includes the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl side chain, converting it to an isopropyl group. Second, Pd/C is a standard catalyst for the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of benzyl ethers. The benzyloxymethyl group is cleaved back to a hydroxymethyl group, and the benzyl group becomes toluene. Therefore, **Product 4** is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect, the tosylhydrazone is removed in step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect, the benzyl ether is cleaved in step 4.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect, this structure would arise from a different reaction pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>"
