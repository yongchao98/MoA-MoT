    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, ∇⋅f, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field, f(r), is directed radially outward and its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin (f(r) = 1/r²).\n\nThis can be solved using the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a region to the surface integral of the field's flux through the closed surface enclosing that region.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states:\n∫∫∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮ (f ⋅ dS)\n\nHere, V is the volume of the sphere of radius R, and S is its surface.\n\n1.  **Define the vector field and the surface element:**\n    *   The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere of radius R, the field is f(R) = (1/R²) * r̂.\n    *   The differential surface area element dS on the sphere is also directed radially outward: dS = r̂ * R² * sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\n2.  **Calculate the dot product f ⋅ dS:**\n    *   f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R²) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ r̂ * R² * sin(θ) dθ dφ ]\n    *   Since r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1, the dot product simplifies to: f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the surface integral (flux):**\n    *   The integral is taken over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle θ are from 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are from 0 to 2π.\n    *   ∮∮ (f ⋅ dS) = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n    *   First, integrate with respect to θ: ∫ (from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] (from 0 to π) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    *   Next, integrate with respect to φ: ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dφ = [φ] (from 0 to 2π) = 2π.\n    *   The total flux is the product of these two results: 2 * 2π = 4π.\n\nA crucial point is that the vector field has a singularity at the origin (r=0), where its magnitude is undefined. A direct calculation of the divergence gives ∇ ⋅ f = 0 for all r ≠ 0. However, the singularity at the origin acts as a source. The Divergence Theorem elegantly handles this by relating the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the enclosing surface, which correctly accounts for the source at the origin. The result, 4π, is independent of the radius R of the sphere, as long as the origin is enclosed.\n\nTherefore, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
