    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State\nThe problem states that a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate. The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume the initial system is effectively at rest.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum ($P_i$):** The total initial momentum is approximately zero.\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, this is:\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\nTherefore, the total initial energy is:\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 2. Final State\nThe annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. These four particles share the total initial energy.\n\n*   **Final Momentum ($P_f$):** Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the four resulting particles must move away from the point of annihilation in such a way that their vector momenta cancel out.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):** The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. Since they all have the same mass and will have the same speed to conserve momentum, their energies are equal. The relativistic energy of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe total final energy is:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### 3. Conservation of Energy\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Velocity\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity ($v$) by the formula:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe need to solve this for $v/c$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092} = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
