    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the molecule's ground state and the next accessible state with the lowest possible energy. The momentum (p) of the photon is then found using the relation p = ΔE/c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J + 1)\n\nWhere:\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck's constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n**1. Initial and Final States**\n\nThe molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible quantum numbers, v=0 and J=0.\n\nFor a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey quantum mechanical selection rules. For rovibrational transitions in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition to a higher energy state is to v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot be negative). Therefore, the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial)**: E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final Energy (E_final)**: E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**2. Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the photon is the difference between the final and initial states:\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - (1/2)ħω\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**3. Calculation of Parameters**\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I) of the molecule.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    *   Mx = 20 amu = 20 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) = 3.32 x 10⁻²⁶ kg\n    *   My = 2 amu = 2 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) = 3.32 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.32 x 10⁻²⁶ * 3.32 x 10⁻²⁷) / (3.32 x 10⁻²⁶ + 3.32 x 10⁻²⁷) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    *   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   I = μR² = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**4. Calculation of Photon Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow, we calculate the two terms of the energy difference:\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    *   ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n    *   ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.2 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n**5. Calculation of Photon Momentum (p)**\n\nFinally, we calculate the photon's momentum.\n\n*   **Momentum (p):**\n    *   c = 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   p = ΔE / c = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
