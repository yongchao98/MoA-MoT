    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to find the color of the light it emits. The energy of the emitted light is given, and we can use this to calculate its wavelength.\n\nFirst, we convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to Joules (J) using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J.\nEnergy (E) = 2.3393 eV * 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV ≈ 3.7475 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nNext, we calculate the wavelength (λ) using the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) and 'c' is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s). Rearranging the formula to solve for wavelength gives λ = hc/E.\n\nλ = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / 3.7475 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\nλ ≈ 5.304 x 10⁻⁷ meters\n\nTo make this value easier to interpret in the context of the visible light spectrum, we convert it to nanometers (nm), where 1 m = 10⁹ nm.\nλ ≈ 530.4 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\nA substance that emits a certain color of light absorbs light of the complementary color. The complementary color to green is red. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
