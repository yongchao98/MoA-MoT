    "The reaction described involves treating a compound with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water to produce a diketone. This set of reagents is used for the nitrosation of a carbon atom alpha (α) to a carbonyl group. The initial product, an α-nitroso ketone, tautomerizes to a more stable oxime, which is then hydrolyzed to yield an α-diketone (a 1,2-diketone). Therefore, the starting materials A and B must be ketones.\n\n**Reaction A: Formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\nThe product is a 1,2-diketone, meaning the two ketone groups are on adjacent carbons. The starting material, A, must be a ketone that can be oxidized at the adjacent carbon. The logical precursor is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. In this molecule, the carbonyl group is at position 1. The adjacent (alpha) carbons are at positions 2 and 6. The reaction with NaNO₂/HCl will introduce a second carbonyl group at one of these alpha positions, resulting in the desired 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.\n\n**Reaction B: Formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\nSimilarly, the product is a 1,2-diketone. The starting material, B, must be a ketone that allows for the formation of a second carbonyl group on the adjacent carbon. The logical precursor is 5-methylhexan-2-one. In this molecule, the carbonyl group is at position 2. The adjacent (alpha) carbons are at positions 1 (a methyl group) and 3 (a methylene group). The reaction will occur at the more substituted C-3 position, introducing a carbonyl group there to form 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct starting materials are:\n*   **A:** 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one\n*   **B:** 5-methylhexan-2-one\n\nThis corresponds to option C. The other options are incorrect because they list alcohols or diols as starting materials (options A, B, and D for starting material A, and option A and B for starting material B), which are not the correct substrates for this specific transformation to an α-diketone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
