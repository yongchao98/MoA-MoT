    "### Analysis of Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a classic Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base will exclusively deprotonate C6 to form the corresponding enolate.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate anion at C6 will act as a nucleophile and attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester), which is the Michael acceptor. A new carbon-carbon bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):** The resulting product will have the ethyl propanoate group attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This name treats the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n        *   The propanoate chain is attached to the cyclohexyl ring at position 1. This corresponds to C6 of our starting ketone.\n        *   The name indicates a methyl group at position 1 (`1,3-dimethyl`), which is consistent with the methyl group at C6 of the starting material.\n        *   The oxo (=O) group is at position 2. This corresponds to C1 of our starting ketone.\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are at position 3. This corresponds to C2 of our starting ketone.\n    *   This name accurately describes the connectivity of the product formed. The alternative name, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, would imply the carbonyl group is at position 4 relative to the point of attachment, which is incorrect.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition, often called a nitro-Michael reaction.\n\n1.  **Carbanion Formation:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion) at C1 of the propane chain.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion will act as a nucleophile and attack the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile functional group.\n    *   The chain is: `CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   This is a six-carbon chain, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. The alternative name, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, is incorrect as it describes a different carbon skeleton.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
