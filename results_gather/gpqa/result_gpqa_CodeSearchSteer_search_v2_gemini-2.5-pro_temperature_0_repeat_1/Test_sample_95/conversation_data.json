    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.\n\n**1. Determine the size of the event horizon**\n\nFirst, we need to find the physical radius of the event horizon (the Schwarzschild radius, `R_s`) from its angular size (`θ`) and the distance to the galaxy (`d`).\n\n*   The given distance is `d = 10^10` parsecs. We convert this to meters using the conversion factor 1 parsec ≈ 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n    `d = 10^10 pc * (3.086 x 10^16 m/pc) = 3.086 x 10^26 m`\n\n*   The given angular size is `θ = 10^-17` degrees. We must convert this to radians for calculations, using the conversion π radians = 180 degrees.\n    `θ = 10^-17 degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745 x 10^-19` radians\n\n*   For a very small angle, the diameter of the event horizon (`2 * R_s`) can be approximated by `d * θ`.\n    `2 * R_s ≈ d * θ`\n    `R_s ≈ (d * θ) / 2`\n    `R_s ≈ (3.086 x 10^26 m * 1.745 x 10^-19 rad) / 2`\n    `R_s ≈ 2.692 x 10^7 m`\n\n**2. Calculate the area of the event horizon**\n\nThe area (`A`) of the event horizon, which is a sphere, is given by the formula `A = 4πR_s²`.\n`A = 4 * π * (2.692 x 10^7 m)²`\n`A ≈ 9.106 x 10^15 m²`\n\n**3. Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy**\n\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n\n`S = (k_B * A * c³) / (4 * ħ * G)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `c` is the speed of light (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²).\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n\n`S ≈ ( (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) * (9.106 x 10^15 m²) * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)³ ) / ( 4 * (1.054 x 10^-34 J·s) * (6.674 x 10^-11 m³/kg·s²) )`\n\n`S ≈ (3.395 x 10^18) / (2.814 x 10^-44) J/K`\n\n`S ≈ 1.206 x 10^62 J/K`\n\nThe calculated order of magnitude for the entropy of the black hole is 10⁶². Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
