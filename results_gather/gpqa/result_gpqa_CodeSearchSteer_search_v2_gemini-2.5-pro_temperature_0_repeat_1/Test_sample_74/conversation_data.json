  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of molecular translation.\n\nThe sequence begins with `5' ATG...`, which correctly corresponds to the start codon for Methionine, initiating protein synthesis. The construct is designed to have an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The amino acid sequence for a standard HA tag is Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA).\n\nLet's translate the provided DNA sequence codon by codon (in triplets) to see the resulting amino acid sequence:\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start codon)\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n*   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n*   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n*   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n*   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n*   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n*   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n\nThis part of the sequence correctly codes for the Met-HA tag (M-YPYDVPDYA). Now, let's examine the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence:\n*   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n*   `TGA` -> **Stop**\n\nThe `TGA` codon is one of the three universal stop codons (along with `UAA` and `UAG` in RNA) that signals the ribosome to terminate translation. Because this stop codon appears immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single lysine, the ribosome will detach, and the rest of the GADD45G protein will not be synthesized. This results in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide instead of the full-length tagged protein.\n\nAnalyzing the other options:\n*   A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This is incorrect. The problematic codon is TGA, not TAA. Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation.\n*   B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: This is incorrect. The DNA sequence correctly codes for the standard YPYDVPDYA amino acid sequence of the HA tag.\n*   D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While linkers can be important for protein folding, the presence of a premature stop codon is a more direct and definitive reason for the failure to produce the full-length protein. The issue is a failure of synthesis, not degradation after synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that a premature stop codon was accidentally introduced, causing the ribosome to terminate translation before the GADD45G protein could be made.\n\n<<<C>>>"
