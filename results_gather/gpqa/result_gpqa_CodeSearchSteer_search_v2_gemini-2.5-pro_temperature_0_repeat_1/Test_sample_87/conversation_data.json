    "The scenario describes an immune response initiated in the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs crucial for monitoring intestinal antigens. When the rotavirus capsid proteins are taken up, they activate B cells within these structures.\n\nThe activated B cells proliferate in specialized microenvironments called germinal centers, which are abundant in Peyer's patches. Inside the germinal centers, these B cells undergo a process to refine the affinity of their antibodies for the antigen. This process involves introducing a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of their immunoglobulin genes, including the heavy chain. This mechanism is known as somatic hypermutation (SHM). The \"high variability\" observed in the sequenced variable heavy chain gene is the direct result of these mutations. B cells with mutations that improve antigen binding are then selected to survive and differentiate further.\n\nLet's consider the other options:\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system that helps clear pathogens but does not involve the genetic modification of B cell receptor genes.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers, but it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody's effector function (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut) without altering its antigen-binding specificity.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the initial process of generating a diverse B cell repertoire by combining different gene segments. However, it occurs in the bone marrow during the early development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The high variability in an already activated and proliferating population is due to a secondary diversification process.\n\nTherefore, the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
