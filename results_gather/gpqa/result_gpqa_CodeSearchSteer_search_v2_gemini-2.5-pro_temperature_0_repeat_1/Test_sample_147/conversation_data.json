    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular weight of substance A4:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. The mass percentage of fluorine is calculated as:\n\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\n    Assuming the atomic weight of Fluorine (Ar(F)) is approximately 19 g/mol, we can solve for the atomic weight of Y (Ar(Y)):\n\n    0.3196 = (19n) / (Ar(Y) + 19n)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45n\n\n    By testing integer values for n, we find that for n=3, Ar(Y) is approximately 121.35 g/mol. This corresponds to the element Antimony (Sb), which has an atomic weight of 121.76 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A2:** With Y as Antimony (Sb) and n=3, substance A2 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃). Let's verify the fluorine mass percentage in SbF₃. The molecular weight of SbF₃ is approximately 178.76 g/mol. The percentage of fluorine is (3 × 18.998) / 178.76, which equals ~31.88%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A3:** A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Antimony) and it can interact with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony produces antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅). SbF₅ is a very strong Lewis acid and is known to react with xenon compounds like XeF₄ and XeF₆. Therefore, A3 is SbF₅.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Remaining Compounds and Reactions:**\n    *   The problem mentions five binary compounds of fluorine and antimony. Besides SbF₃ (A2) and SbF₅ (A3), other known binary compounds or complexes exist.\n    *   Substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes to A2 (SbF₃). This information is likely intended to help identify A2, although the properties of A1 do not match common antimony fluorides, suggesting a possible inaccuracy in the problem description regarding its color or a reference to a very unstable, obscure compound.\n    *   Substance A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. This describes a comproportionation reaction where Sb(0) reduces the antimony in A4.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n\n5.  **Determine Substance A4:** We need to identify A4 from the known binary fluorides of antimony. The most common are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₃ is 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   The molecular weight of SbF₅ is 216.75 g/mol.\n\n    Let's compare these molecular weights to the given options:\n    *   A) 110-130\n    *   B) 220-240\n    *   C) 160-180\n    *   D) 140-160\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within the range of option C (160-180). The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fit well into any range, being closest to but outside of option B.\n\n    In the context of a multiple-choice question, such a precise fit is a strong indicator. Therefore, it is highly probable that substance A4 is SbF₃. This implies that A4 and A2 are the same compound. The reaction to form A5 would be `Sb + SbF₃ -> A5`, likely forming a subfluoride that, as stated, would decompose in water.\n\nBased on the molecular weight, A4 is Antimony Trifluoride (SbF₃), which is 178.76 g/mol. This value is in the 160-180 range.\n\n<<<C>>>"
