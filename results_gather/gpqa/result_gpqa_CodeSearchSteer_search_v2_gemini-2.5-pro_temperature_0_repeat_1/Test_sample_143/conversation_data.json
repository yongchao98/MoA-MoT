    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n**1. Calculate the mean lifetime (τ) of the particle in its rest frame.**\n\nThe relationship between the decay width (Γ) and the mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is given by the uncertainty principle:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s.\n\nGiven:\nΓₓ = 320 MeV\n\nCalculation:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) of the particle.**\n\nThe Lorentz factor describes the time dilation and length contraction for a moving object. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\n\nGiven:\nEₓ = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\nmₓ = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n\nCalculation:\nγ = Eₓ / mₓ = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV\nγ = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.667\n\n**3. Calculate the velocity factor (β) of the particle.**\n\nThe factor β is the ratio of the particle's velocity to the speed of light (c). It can be derived from the Lorentz factor.\n\nCalculation:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - β²)\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\nβ = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400)\nβ ≈ 0.9887\n\n**4. Calculate the mean decay distance (L) in the laboratory frame.**\n\nThe mean decay distance is the distance the particle travels on average before it decays. Due to relativistic effects, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor (γ). The distance is the product of the particle's velocity (v = βc) and its dilated lifetime (γτ).\n\nCalculation:\nL = β * γ * c * τ\nL ≈ 0.9887 * (20/3) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n\nA more direct way to calculate βγ is using the momentum (p):\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\np = √(E² - m²) / c = √(8² - 1.2²) GeV/c = √(64 - 1.44) GeV/c = √62.56 GeV/c\nβγ = p / m = (√62.56 GeV/c) / (1.2 GeV/c²)c = √62.56 / 1.2 ≈ 6.591\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean decay distance:\nL = (βγ) * c * τ\nL ≈ 6.591 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
