    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance a particle travels before it decays, considering the effects of special relativity. Here is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor accounts for relativistic effects like time dilation. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m₀c²).\n    *   E = 27 GeV\n    *   m₀c² = 3.41 GeV\n    *   γ = E / m₀c² = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lifetime in the Lab Frame (τ):** Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime as observed in the bubble chamber (the lab frame) is longer than its proper lifetime (τ₀).\n    *   Proper lifetime τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s\n    *   Lab frame lifetime τ = γ × τ₀ = 7.918 × (8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s) ≈ 6.334 × 10⁻¹⁵ s\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity is very close to the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   λ = c × τ = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) × (6.334 × 10⁻¹⁵ s) ≈ 1.900 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Resolution:** We need to find the minimum resolution `d` required to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means we are looking for the distance `d` for which the probability of the particle traveling at least that far is 30%. The probability of a particle surviving to a distance `d` follows an exponential decay law.\n    *   P(distance ≥ d) = e^(-d/λ)\n    *   We are given that this probability is 30%, or 0.30.\n    *   0.30 = e^(-d/λ)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Distance (d):** To find `d`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation.\n    *   ln(0.30) = -d / λ\n    *   d = -λ × ln(0.30)\n    *   d = -(1.900 × 10⁻⁶ m) × (-1.204)\n    *   d ≈ 2.288 × 10⁻⁶ m\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 2.08 × 10⁻⁶ m\n*   B) 2.08 × 10⁻³ m\n*   C) 2.08 × 10⁻¹ m\n*   D) 2.08 × 10⁻⁹ m\n\nThe calculated value of 2.288 × 10⁻⁶ m is closest to option A. The minor discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the problem's provided values or options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
