    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2, and for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (CnH2n) is (2n * 1.008) / (12.01 * n + 1.008 * 2n) ≈ 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   This percentage perfectly matches the formula for a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent and is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen).\n    *   The simplest and most common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This will be verified by the consistency of the other steps.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is substance Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   The other component of Y must therefore also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. For this to be possible, and for it to not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   The aromatic compound with a 6-carbon ring is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and hydrogenates under severe conditions (3H₂/Pt) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation where mixture X is converted to mixture Y. Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction can be written as:\n        A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. For the atoms to balance, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms on both sides must be equal.\n    *   Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy.\n    *   The hydrogen balance is: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   We need to find two different molecules, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy), that fit the following criteria:\n        *   Have a 6-carbon ring skeleton.\n        *   Are unsaturated (alkenes/dienes).\n        *   Are non-conjugated.\n        *   The sum of their hydrogen atoms (x + y) is 18.\n    *   The most common unsaturated, non-conjugated molecules with a C6 ring skeleton are:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check if these two molecules fit the hydrogen sum:\n        *   x = 10 (from cyclohexene)\n        *   y = 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n        *   x + y = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   This combination perfectly fits all the conditions. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The disproportionation reaction involves the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which becomes benzene) to cyclohexene (which becomes cyclohexane).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
