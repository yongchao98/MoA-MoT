    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed from the fields of the SM and are suppressed by a high-energy scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian is based on certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n**1. Lorentz Symmetry and 2. Poincare Symmetry:**\nThe SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz invariant effective field theory. The operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are local and must obey the symmetries of the Standard Model, which include Poincaré symmetry. The Poincaré group is the group of spacetime symmetries that includes translations in space and time, rotations, and boosts (Lorentz transformations). Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry.\n\n**3. CP Symmetry:**\nCP symmetry, which is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetry, is known to be violated in the Standard Model. The SMEFT provides a framework to parameterize potential new sources of CP violation beyond what is predicted by the SM. There are specific classifications of SMEFT operators based on their CP properties, distinguishing between CP-even, CP-odd, and CP-violating operators. This indicates that not all operators in SMEFT are required to conserve CP symmetry.\n\n**4. CPT Symmetry:**\nThe CPT theorem is a fundamental principle in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it is expected to respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT symmetry would imply a violation of Lorentz symmetry.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
