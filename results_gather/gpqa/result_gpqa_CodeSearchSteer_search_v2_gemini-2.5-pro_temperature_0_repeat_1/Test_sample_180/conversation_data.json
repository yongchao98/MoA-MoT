    "To determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch affects them.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways:\n\n*   **Proton-Proton (pp) I, II, and III chains:** These are the primary ways the Sun generates energy.\n*   **CNO cycle:** This is a secondary process, contributing only about 1% of the Sun's energy.\n\nLet's examine the neutrino energies from the relevant branches:\n\n1.  **pp-III Branch:** The key neutrino-producing reaction in this branch is the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B). This decay creates a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos, up to about 14 MeV. These ⁸B neutrinos contribute to the flux in *both* the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. According to the problem's premise, this source of neutrinos has stopped.\n\n2.  **pp-II Branch:** This branch produces mono-energetic (single-energy) neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). The vast majority (about 90%) of these neutrinos have a distinct energy of **861 keV**. This sharp energy line falls squarely within **band 2 (800-900 keV)**. The pp-II branch is unaffected by the shutdown of the pp-III branch.\n\n3.  **CNO Cycle:** The CNO cycle produces neutrinos from the decays of Nitrogen-13 (¹³N) and Oxygen-15 (¹⁵O), which have continuous energy spectra up to about 1.2 MeV and 1.7 MeV, respectively. This means the CNO cycle contributes a relatively low, continuous background flux to *both* band 1 and band 2. This cycle is also unaffected.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWith the pp-III branch turned off, we can assess the remaining sources for each energy band:\n\n*   **Flux (band 1: 700-800 keV):** The only remaining contributors are the continuous, low-level background neutrinos from the CNO cycle.\n*   **Flux (band 2: 800-900 keV):** The contributors are the low-level background from the CNO cycle *plus* the very intense, single-energy line of 861 keV neutrinos from the pp-II branch.\n\nThe flux from the 861 keV ⁷Be line is significantly higher than the CNO continuum flux in that energy region. A look at the solar neutrino spectrum shows that the flux of the ⁷Be line is orders of magnitude greater than the CNO background.\n\nTherefore, the flux in band 2 will be vastly larger than the flux in band 1. The ratio of Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2) will be a very small number.\n\nThe ratio can be approximated as:\n`Ratio ≈ (Low CNO Flux) / (Low CNO Flux + High ⁷Be Flux)`\n\nSince the ⁷Be flux dominates the denominator, the ratio is much less than 1. Comparing the options provided, 0.01 (10⁻²) is the most plausible value representing this significant difference in flux.\n\n<<<C>>>"
