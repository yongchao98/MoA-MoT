    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene with a high yield, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nThe target molecule is:\n![1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one](httpshttps://i.imgur.com/9z4jY7p.png)\nIt has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). All three groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the relevant functional groups:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). The lone pair on the nitrogen atom complexes with AlCl3, forming a strongly deactivating group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Nitration:** Bromobenzene is nitrated mainly at the *para* position to give 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** The starting material, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings. This pathway is not viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n1.  **i-iv) Nitration, Reduction, Diazotization, Deamination:** This sequence (Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene) is circular and returns to the starting material. This sequence is illogical.\n\n**C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nLet's analyze the core synthetic steps needed, which are the first three. The subsequent steps appear to be extraneous.\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This is a standard and efficient reaction.\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has two deactivating groups: the acetyl group at position 1 (*meta*-directing) and the bromo group at position 3 (*ortho, para*-directing). The desired product requires the nitro group to be added at position 5. This position is *meta* to the acetyl group but also *meta* to the bromo group. While the directing effects are conflicting, this sequence is more practical than alternatives. The alternative of nitrating first to make 3-nitroacetophenone and then brominating would require carrying out bromination on a ring deactivated by two strong electron-withdrawing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2), which would be extremely difficult. Nitrating 3-bromoacetophenone is more feasible because the bromine atom is less deactivating than a nitro group. Therefore, this sequence represents the most practical approach among the choices, even if the final step's yield is compromised by competing directing effects.\n\nThe most logical and highest-yielding three-step synthesis to achieve the target is actually Acylation → Nitration → Bromination, because in the final step (bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone), both the acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors and reinforce each other to direct the bromine to position 5. However, this exact sequence is not offered as an option.\n\nGiven the choices, and eliminating A, B, and D as non-viable, option C presents the most plausible (though imperfect) synthetic strategy for the core reactions. The sequence of acylation followed by the introduction of the other two groups is the correct starting point, and placing the more deactivating nitro group last is kinetically more favorable.\n\n<<<C>>>"
