    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple geometry like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The behavior of the radiated power from such a system follows well-established principles of electromagnetism.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform in all directions. It is a function of the angle `θ` measured from the z-axis and is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value of 1. This happens at `θ = 90°`, which is in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`, we can calculate the value of `sin²(30°)`:\n\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power `A`.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω` of the oscillation (`P ∝ ω⁴`). The angular frequency is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power, we get:\n\n`P ∝ (1/λ)⁴` or `P ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis means the function `f`, representing the radiated power per unit solid angle, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The possible form of the function `f` describing the radiated power shows a dependence on wavelength of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
