    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to an alcohol using Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products. Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the two products are diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to alcohols by sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction results in pentane-2,4-diol. Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are therefore a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the combined mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the meso compound)\n\n### **HPLC Analysis**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture:\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will separate into **two peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, giving **one peak**.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n    *   Therefore, a total of **four peaks** will be observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n    *   All five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated.\n    *   This results in **five distinct peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit **5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
