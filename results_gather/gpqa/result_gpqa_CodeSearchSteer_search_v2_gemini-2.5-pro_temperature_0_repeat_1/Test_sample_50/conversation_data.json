    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images.\n\n1.  **Image Charge:** For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the system of fields outside the sphere can be replicated by placing an \"image charge,\" `q'`, inside the sphere. This image charge is positioned along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center of the sphere.\n\n2.  **Work Done:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere's surface. In the image charge method, this is equivalent to the work done against the force from the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Potential Energy Calculation:** The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the potential created by the image charge `q'` is given by the interaction energy. However, a crucial point in these systems is that the total potential energy is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. This factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge distribution itself has energy that changes as the external charge is moved.\n\n    The interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'` is:\n    `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n\n    Substituting the values of `q'` and the distance:\n    `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `U_interaction = -k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    The net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
