    "To find the partition function Z of the system, we need to sum over all possible states of the system, where each state's contribution is given by the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE). The system consists of three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can take the value +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each one.\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **All spins down:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThese two states have an energy of -3J.\n\n3.  **One spin down, two spins up:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\n4.  **One spin up, two spins down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\nThese six states all have an energy of J.\n\nNow we can write the partition function Z, which is the sum over all states of e^(-βE):\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\n\nWe can group the states by their energy levels:\n*   There are 2 states with energy E = -3J.\n*   There are 6 states with energy E = J.\n\nSo, the partition function is:\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
