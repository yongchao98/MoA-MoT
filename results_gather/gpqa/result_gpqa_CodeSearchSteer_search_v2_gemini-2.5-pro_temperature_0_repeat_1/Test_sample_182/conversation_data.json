    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the starting material and the chemical transformation it undergoes.\n\n**1. Starting Material:**\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group.\n*   **Formyl:** A -CHO group (an aldehyde).\n*   **Vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group.\n\nBased on the name, the structure has a cyclohexene ring, a carboxylic acid group, a formyl group, and a vinyl group. The molecular formula for this compound is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material can be calculated from its structure:\n*   One ring = 1\n*   One double bond in the ring = 1\n*   One double bond in the vinyl group = 1\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group = 1\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1\n*   **Total IHD of starting material = 5**\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups completely to alkanes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n**3. The Product:**\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and points of unsaturation in the starting molecule:\n*   The carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. This is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product:**\nThe IHD of a molecule indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds it contains. The formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. Each ring or double bond reduces the hydrogen count by two.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C - (H/2) + 1\n*   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n*   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n*   IHD = 1\n\nThe resulting IHD of 1 is due to the presence of the single cyclohexane ring in the final product, which is fully saturated and contains no double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
