    "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons produced in the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial State Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   The energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   The momentum is given by p = √(E² - (mc²)²)/c.\n    *   Let m be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron.\n    *   **Electron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n        *   Energy (E_e) = 4mc²\n        *   Momentum (p_e) = √((4mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = mc√(16 - 1) = mc√15. This is in the positive horizontal direction.\n    *   **Positron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n        *   Energy (E_p) = 2mc²\n        *   Momentum (p_p) = -√((2mc²)² - (mc²)²)/c = -mc√(4 - 1) = -mc√3. The negative sign indicates it's moving in the opposite direction.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy (E_i):** E_i = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum (P_i):** P_i = p_e + p_p = mc(√15 - √3) along the horizontal axis.\n\n2.  **Final State Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   The final state consists of two photons.\n    *   It is given that the photons have the same energy, let's call it E_γ.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ/c.\n    *   **Total Final Energy (E_f):** E_f = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n    *   The photons move away at angles θ and -θ with respect to the initial horizontal axis. This is inferred because the initial momentum perpendicular to the axis is zero, so the final perpendicular momenta must cancel out.\n    *   **Total Final Momentum (P_f):** The horizontal components of the photons' momenta add up. P_f = p_γcos(θ) + p_γcos(-θ) = 2p_γcos(θ).\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** E_i = E_f\n        *   6mc² = 2E_γ  =>  E_γ = 3mc²\n    *   **Momentum Conservation:** P_i = P_f\n        *   mc(√15 - √3) = 2p_γcos(θ)\n        *   Substitute the expressions for p_γ (which is E_γ/c):\n        *   mc(√15 - √3) = 2(3mc²/c)cos(θ)\n        *   mc(√15 - √3) = 6mc cos(θ)\n\n4.  **Solving for the Angle:**\n    *   We can cancel mc from both sides:\n        *   √15 - √3 = 6cos(θ)\n    *   Now, solve for cos(θ):\n        *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the photons, which is 2θ.\n    *   Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
