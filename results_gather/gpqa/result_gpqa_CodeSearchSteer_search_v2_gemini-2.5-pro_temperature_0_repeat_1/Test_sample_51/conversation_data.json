    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate here given the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the stellar photosphere.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratio and the Boltzmann Equation\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of atoms across various energy levels at a specific temperature. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels (level 2, the higher level, and level 1, the lower level) is given by:\n\n(n₂ / n₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   n₁ and n₂ are the number of atoms in the lower and higher energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that the observed ratio *decreases* when the star has spots. Since the temperature is lower when spots are present (T_spots < T_nospots), the term -ΔE/(k*T) becomes more negative, causing the exponential term to decrease. This confirms that the ratio in question is n₂/n₁.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\nThe energy difference (ΔE) can be calculated from the given transition wavelength (λ ≈ 1448 Å) using the formula for the energy of a photon:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nA convenient form of this equation for astronomical purposes is:\n\nΔE (in eV) ≈ 12400 / λ (in Å)\n\nPlugging in the wavelength:\n\nΔE ≈ 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n### 3. Setting up the Factor Calculation\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of the ratios:\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nLet R = n₂ / n₁.\n\n*   R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n*   R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\nThe factor is:\n\nFactor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n\n### 4. Performing the Calculation\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term ΔE / k:\n\nΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\nNext, the temperature difference term:\n\n(1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (11 - 12) / 66000 = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹\n\nNow, combine these results in the exponent:\n\nExponent = (-99379 K) * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\n\nFactor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this calculation since the effective temperatures are provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
