    "To determine the comoving distance to the quasar, we first need to calculate its redshift based on the provided spectral information. The observation of a peak at 790 nm with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is a classic indicator of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. The flux drop is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, which consists of numerous absorption lines from intervening neutral hydrogen clouds.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nm. The redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.5 - 1\nz ≈ 5.5\n\nNow, using the given cosmological parameters of the Lambda-CDM model (H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ω_matter = 0.3, Ω_dark_energy = 0.7, and a flat universe), we can calculate the comoving distance for a redshift of z = 5.5. This calculation is typically performed using a cosmology calculator, which integrates the Friedmann equation.\n\nBy inputting these values into a standard cosmological calculator, the comoving distance is found to be approximately 9 Gpc. This value represents the distance between the Earth and the quasar at the present time (with the scale factor a=1), factoring out the expansion of the universe.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 9 Gpc\nB) 7 Gpc\nC) 8 Gpc\nD) 6 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance most closely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
