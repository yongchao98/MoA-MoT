    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its star. The formula is dependent on the star's effective temperature (T_eff), the star's radius (R_star), and the planet's semi-major axis (a), which is its distance from the star in a circular orbit.\n\nThe relationship is:\nT_eq ∝ sqrt(R_star / a)\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following proportion. Since both planets orbit the same star, the star's radius and effective temperature are constant and cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((R_star / a1) / (R_star / a2)) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio is the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift\nThe radial velocity method detects planets by observing the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This wobble induces a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The maximum change in the star's velocity towards or away from us is the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nThis velocity (v) is related to the Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula:\nv / c = Δλ / λ₀\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nTherefore, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the maximum observed Doppler shift (Δλ):\nK ∝ Δλ\n\n### 3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Distance\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass, M_p, is much smaller than the star's mass, M_star), the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) can be related to the planet's mass and its semi-major axis (a) with the following formula:\n\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nTo find the semi-major axis 'a', we can rearrange this formula:\na ≈ (G / M_star) * (M_p / K)²\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nWe can now find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1). The terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) will cancel out:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2 / K2)²] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1 / K1)²]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\nSince K is proportional to Δλ, we can substitute the Doppler shift values:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)²\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (0.03 / 0.04)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
