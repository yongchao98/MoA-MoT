    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], from a solution of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we must consider the dissociation of the complex.\n\nThe dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻) is:\n\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (also denoted as K_Ca-EDTA), is given for the forward reaction:\n\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\n\nK_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺. Since the dissociation produces Ca²⁺ and EDTA (Y⁴⁻) in a 1:1 ratio, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\n*   Initial concentration:\n    *   [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 M\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = 0 M\n*   Change in concentration:\n    *   [CaY²⁻] = -x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = +x\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = +x\n*   Equilibrium concentration:\n    *   [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\nNow, substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex dissociates very little. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that:\n\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
