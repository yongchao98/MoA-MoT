    "The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), with an epoxide is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. The mechanism follows SN2-like characteristics. Based on the principles of this reaction, we can determine the product.\n\n**1. Regioselectivity: Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n\nThe prompt and established chemical principles state that the nucleophile from the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group and three other carbons.\n*   Carbon C6 is a secondary carbon, as it is bonded to two other carbons.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me‚Åª) from Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered **C6** carbon.\n\n**2. Stereoselectivity: Inversion of Configuration**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a backside attack, which is characteristic of an SN2 reaction. This results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n*   The initial configuration at the point of attack, C6, is **(S)**.\n*   Following the SN2 attack by the methyl group, the configuration at this carbon will be inverted to **(R)**.\n*   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps, so their configurations are retained.\n\n**3. Structure and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nLet's assemble the final product:\n\n*   **Backbone:** The reaction opens the epoxide but leaves the six-membered cyclohexane ring intact. The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (which is implied), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. A new methyl group is added to C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming and Numbering:** The carbon bearing the principal functional group, the hydroxyl group, is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the bicyclic system. The adjacent carbon, where the new methyl group was added (the original C6), becomes C2. Continuing around the ring, the original C4 methyl group is at the new C4 position, and the original C3 methyl group is at the new C5 position.\n*   **Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** The configuration was (R) and is retained. So, the new C1 is **(1R)**.\n    *   **C2 (originally C6):** The configuration was (S) and was inverted. So, the new C2 is **(2R)**.\n    *   **C4:** The configuration was (R) and is retained. So, the new C4 is **(4R)**.\n    *   **C5 (originally C3):** The configuration was (R) and is retained. So, the new C5 is **(5R)**.\n\nCombining these pieces, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
