    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is common for 1,5-dienes and involves a concerted, cyclic shift of electrons through a six-membered transition state.\n\nThe starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure contains a nine-carbon chain with double bonds starting at carbons 2 and 6, and a butyl group at carbon 5. The core of the molecule, from carbon 2 to carbon 7 (C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7), constitutes the 1,5-diene system that participates in the rearrangement.\n\nThe Cope rearrangement involves the breaking of the sigma bond between carbons 4 and 5 and the formation of a new sigma bond between carbons 2 and 7. Simultaneously, the double bonds shift to new positions. The overall result is a structural isomer of the starting material.\n\nTo determine the product, we can trace the connectivity of the carbon atoms after the rearrangement:\n1.  The original C4-C5 bond is broken.\n2.  A new C2-C7 bond is formed.\n3.  New double bonds are formed between C3 and C4, and between C5 and C6.\n\nThe resulting structure is then named according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. This involves identifying the longest continuous carbon chain that contains both new double bonds and numbering it to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. The substituents are then named and numbered accordingly.\n\nFollowing this process, the product is identified as **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
