    "The correct statement regarding the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is that it applies to a trap-free, single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts (which implies no barrier to carrier injection) and where the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney law to be valid:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The current is assumed to be carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free Semiconductor:** The material is considered to be an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no trapping states within the band gap that can immobilize charge carriers. The presence of traps would alter the voltage dependence of the current.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts:** The electrical contacts to the semiconductor must be Ohmic, meaning they allow for the free injection of charge carriers into the device without forming a significant energy barrier. This ensures that the current is limited by the space charge within the device and not by the injection process at the contact. A Schottky contact, which is a rectifying barrier, would violate this condition.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The model assumes that the dominant charge transport mechanism is drift, which is the movement of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of charge carriers due to concentration gradients is considered negligible.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   A is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is for single-carrier devices, not two-carrier devices.\n*   B is correct as it accurately lists the key conditions: a trap-free material, a single carrier type, no injection barrier (Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current.\n*   C is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation describes a drift-dominated current; therefore, the drift current is the primary component, not a negligible one.\n*   D is incorrect because a Schottky contact presents an energy barrier to charge injection, which is contrary to the requirement of an Ohmic contact.\n\n<<<B>>>"
