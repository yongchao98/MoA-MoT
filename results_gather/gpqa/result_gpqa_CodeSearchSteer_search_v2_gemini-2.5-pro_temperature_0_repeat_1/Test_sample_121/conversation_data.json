    "The step-by-step synthesis of the final product, molecule 4, and the determination of its structure are as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Bromoacetic Acid (Product 1)**\n    Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination when treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This reaction yields bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Ethyl Bromoacetate (Product 2)**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is subjected to a Fischer esterification reaction with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst (sulfuric acid). This process converts the carboxylic acid into an ester, resulting in ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Ethyl Cyanoacetate (Product 3)**\n    Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide. In this nucleophilic substitution reaction, the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 4: Formation of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane (Product 4)**\n    Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) has an acidic methylene group (the CH₂ between the cyano and ester groups). In the presence of excess sodium hydride, a strong base, this methylene group is deprotonated. The resulting carbanion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess sodium hydride then removes the second proton from the alpha-carbon. This is followed by an intramolecular reaction where the carbanion attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring. The final product, 4, is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon atom bonded to the cyano and ethoxycarbonyl groups (C1) and the opposite carbon in the ring (C4).\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The hydrogens of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are chemically different from the hydrogens of the methyl group (-CH₃). This results in **two** distinct signals.\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** Due to the plane of symmetry and rapid chair-flipping at room temperature:\n    *   The four hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This gives **one** signal.\n    *   The four hydrogens on the next set of carbons (C3 and C5) are also chemically equivalent to each other. This gives a second signal for the ring, which is distinct from the C2/C6 hydrogens. This is **one** signal.\n    *   The two hydrogens on the carbon directly opposite C1 (C4) are unique and equivalent to each other. This gives a third distinct signal for the ring. This is **one** signal.\n\nIn total, there are two signals from the ethyl group and three signals from the cyclohexane ring, making a total of **five** distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<C>>>"
