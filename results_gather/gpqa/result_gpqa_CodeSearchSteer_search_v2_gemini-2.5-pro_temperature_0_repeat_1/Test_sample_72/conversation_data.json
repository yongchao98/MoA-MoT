    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations for the relative speed and the total energy of the system of two astronauts.\n\n#### Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts traveling in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v₁ = 0.6c and v₂ = 0.5c.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) is:\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n#### Total Energy (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the individual total energies of its components. The total energy (E) of a single particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where 'γ' is the Lorentz factor, 'm' is the rest mass, and 'c' is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**1. Energy of the first astronaut (E₁):**\n*   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\nγ₁ = 1 / √0.64\nγ₁ = 1 / 0.8\nγ₁ = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₁):\nE₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c²\nE₁ = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\nE₁ = 2.5 mc²\n\n**2. Energy of the second astronaut (E₂):**\n*   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\nγ₂ = 1 / √0.75\nγ₂ ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₂):\nE₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c²\nE₂ ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c²\nE₂ ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**3. Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\nThe total energy is the sum of E₁ and E₂:\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n**E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\nBased on these calculations, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
