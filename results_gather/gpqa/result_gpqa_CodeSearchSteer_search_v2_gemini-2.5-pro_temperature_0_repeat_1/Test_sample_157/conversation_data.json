    "A dominant-negative mutation occurs when a mutated protein interferes with the function of the normal, wild-type protein. This is particularly common for proteins that must assemble into multi-unit complexes to function, such as the transcription factor in the scenario.\n\nIn a heterozygous individual with mutation Y in the dimerization domain, both normal and mutant transcription factor subunits are produced. The key to the dominant-negative effect is that the mutant subunit can still dimerize with the wild-type subunit. However, the resulting heterodimer (one normal subunit + one mutant subunit) is non-functional. This \"poisons\" the wild-type protein by sequestering it in an inactive complex, which can lead to a loss-of-function phenotype even though a normal copy of the gene is present.\n\nConsidering the likely molecular consequences:\n\n*   **Formation of non-functional complexes:** The primary event is the formation of faulty heterodimers that cannot perform their function (e.g., binding DNA or activating transcription).\n*   **Cellular response to abnormal proteins:** The cell has quality control mechanisms to deal with misfolded or improperly formed proteins and complexes. An abnormal heterodimer can be recognized by these systems, leading to its degradation, often via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This degradation would remove the wild-type protein along with the mutant, causing a loss of the wild-type protein's function.\n*   **Protein aggregation:** In some cases, mutations can cause proteins to misfold and form large, insoluble aggregates. This aggregation could also trap wild-type proteins, leading to a loss of function.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n\n*   **A) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This option accurately describes a very plausible mechanism. The formation of a non-functional heterodimer leads to the \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele's\" protein product. A common cellular response to such an aberrant complex is to target it for degradation.\n*   **B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative effect requires the mutant to interact (dimerize) with the wild-type protein, and it results in a mutant, not wild-type, phenotype.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While possible, protein aggregation is a specific type of outcome. The formation of a non-functional dimer that is subsequently degraded is a more general and very common mechanism for a dominant-negative effect.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect because a dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n\nComparing A and C, option A provides a more precise description of the genetic effect (\"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\") and a very common molecular mechanism (protein degradation) for eliminating abnormal protein complexes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
