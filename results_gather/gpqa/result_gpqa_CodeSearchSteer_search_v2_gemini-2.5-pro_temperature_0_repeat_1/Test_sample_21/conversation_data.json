    "Based on the principles of electrochemistry, the correct combination to complete the statement is weaker and slower.\n\nThermodynamically, the strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° signifies a stronger oxidant. In an acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen has a standard potential of +1.23 V. In a basic solution, the standard reduction potential for oxygen is lower, at +0.40 V. Because the reduction potential is less positive in a basic solution compared to an acidic one, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\nKinetically, the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction is known to be slow. This is a significant challenge in technologies like fuel cells, leading to high overpotentials, which means more energy is required to drive the reaction at a useful rate. The reaction is particularly sluggish in acidic media, where factors like catalyst stability and the reaction mechanism contribute to the slow rate. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
