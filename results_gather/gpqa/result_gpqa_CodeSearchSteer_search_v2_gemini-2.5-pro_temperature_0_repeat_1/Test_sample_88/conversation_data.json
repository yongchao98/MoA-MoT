    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the structures of three successive reaction products.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction involves harsh conditions with a strong base on a rigid polycyclic system. Such conditions are known to induce skeletal rearrangements and fragmentation. The provided spectral data for Product 1 are key:\n    *   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of vinylic protons, specifically an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). The total proton count (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) matches the number of protons in the starting material.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** The combination of a ketone and a double bond in a C₁₀H₁₄O formula suggests that the tricyclic adamantane cage has opened to form a bicyclic structure. The known product from the base-induced fragmentation of 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative. The structure that fits all the data is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. The product is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. This process cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (C7=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7 and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In the structure of 3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one, the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. This is the proton at position C3 (H3). Its chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n*   **Coupling Pattern of H3:** To determine the splitting pattern of H3, we must identify its neighboring protons. H3 is on carbon C3, which is adjacent to C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7. This symmetry makes the C2 methylene group equivalent to the C4 methylene group.\n    *   However, within each methylene group (e.g., at C2), the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. Let's call them H2ax/H4ax and H2eq/H4eq.\n    *   Therefore, the proton H3 is coupled to two distinct sets of equivalent protons:\n        1.  The two axial protons at C2 and C4.\n        2.  The two equatorial protons at C2 and C4.\n*   **Splitting:** A proton coupled to a set of two equivalent protons is split into a triplet (n+1 rule). Since H3 is coupled to two *different* sets of two equivalent protons, its signal will be split into a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
