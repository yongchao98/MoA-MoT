    "The annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$). This process, known as pair production, sets a limit on the distance that very high-energy gamma-rays can travel through the universe. For this interaction to occur, the total energy of the two photons in their center-of-mass frame must be at least the combined rest mass energy of the electron and positron.\n\nThe threshold energy for this reaction can be calculated using the principles of special relativity. The condition for pair production is that the product of the energies of the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) and the CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) must be greater than or equal to the square of the rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$). For a head-on collision, which provides the minimum threshold energy for the gamma-ray, the equation is:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\cdot E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nTo find the threshold energy of the gamma-ray, we can rearrange this formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\nFirst, we need to express the electron's rest mass energy in electron volts (eV) to maintain consistent units:\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the threshold energy equation:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the possible answers in giga-electron volts (GeV), so we need to convert our result. Knowing that $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV corresponds to the energy at which gamma-rays would begin to have their lifetimes significantly limited by interactions with the CMB.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nC) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated threshold energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
