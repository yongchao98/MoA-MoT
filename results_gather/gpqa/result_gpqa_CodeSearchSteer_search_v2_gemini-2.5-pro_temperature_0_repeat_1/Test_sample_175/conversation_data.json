    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`.\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The norm squared is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector of P for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v_P=0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. This is done by solving the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0  => x + z = 0  => x = -z`\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose `x=1`, giving `[1, 0, -1]`.\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\n`Norm = √(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`\nThe normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n`|P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the value 0 for the observable P is given by the square of the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector `|P=0⟩`:\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨P=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\n`⟨P=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] · [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\n`Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State Collapse after Measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**5. Find the Eigenvector of Q for the Eigenvalue -1**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the diagonal matrix:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nThe eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = -1` is `[0, 0, 1]`. This vector is already normalized.\n`|Q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n\n**6. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of measuring the value -1 for the observable Q in the new state `|ψ'⟩`. This is given by the square of the projection of the new state onto the eigenvector `|Q=-1⟩`:\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨Q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n\n`⟨Q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]]`\n`= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n`= -1/√2`\n\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<D>>>"
