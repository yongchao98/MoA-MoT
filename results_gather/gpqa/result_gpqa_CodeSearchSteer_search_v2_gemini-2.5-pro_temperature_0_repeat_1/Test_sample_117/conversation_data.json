    "The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine is an example of the alpha-halogenation of a ketone, proceeding through an enol intermediate. Enols, which feature a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, are the reactive intermediates in the acid-catalyzed halogenation of ketones.\n\nThe mechanism involves the following steps:\n*   The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol. The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine (Brâ‚‚).\n*   A C-Br bond is formed at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the one bearing the hydroxyl group).\n*   This is followed by the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group to reform the stable carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\nThis process results in the substitution of a bromine atom for a hydrogen at the alpha-position relative to the carbonyl group. In this specific case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group is on C1. The reaction will place a bromine atom on C2 and convert the enol into its corresponding ketone at C1.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The other options are incorrect because they represent di-bromo addition products, which are not the final, stable outcome of this reaction, or bromination at an incorrect position.\n\n<<<A>>>"
