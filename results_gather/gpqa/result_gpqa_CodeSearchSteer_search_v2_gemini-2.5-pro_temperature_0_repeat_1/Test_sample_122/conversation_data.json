    "The search results confirm my understanding of the physics involved.\n\n*   **Proper Time (Δτ or Δt₀):** This is the time interval between two events that occur at the same location in a particular reference frame. In this problem, the 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's reference frame, where the \"clock\" (the ejecta itself) is stationary. Therefore, 50 seconds is the proper time.\n*   **Time Dilation (Δt):** An observer in a different inertial frame (the Galaxy frame) will measure a longer time interval between the same two events.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor determines the magnitude of time dilation and length contraction. It is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   **The Formula:** The relationship between proper time (Δτ) and the time measured by the stationary observer (Δt) is `Δt = γ * Δτ`.\n*   **Calculation:** To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame, we must use the time elapsed in that same frame.\n    1.  The velocity `v` is 60,000 km/s.\n    2.  The proper time `Δτ` (in the ejecta's frame) is 50 s.\n    3.  First, calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame using time dilation: `Δt = γ * Δτ`.\n    4.  Then, calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n    5.  Combining these gives `d = v * γ * Δτ`.\n\nMy initial calculation was:\n`d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / sqrt(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) `\n`d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96) `\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis is consistent with the physics principles confirmed by the search. The closest answer is A) 3,060,000 km. The minor discrepancy is almost certainly due to rounding in the provided options.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- Frame S = Galaxy (stationary)\n- Frame S' = Ejecta (moving at v = 60,000 km/s)\n- Time in S' = Δt' = 50 s (This is the proper time, Δt₀)\n- Time in S = Δt = ?\n- Distance in S = d = ?\n\n1.  Find time in S (Galaxy frame):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60000/300000)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n2.  Find distance in S (Galaxy frame):\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * ((1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s)`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe result robustly points to option A.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must apply the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" is the stationary frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" is the moving frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **Identify the given values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* because it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy reference frame (`d`).\n\n4.  **Apply the relevant formulas:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the stationary frame (S) is longer than the proper time measured in the moving frame (S'). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame, `Δt`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   Using a calculator, `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`.\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km ≈ 3,061,859 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,859 km.\n    *   This value is extremely close to option A) 3,060,000 km. The small difference is due to rounding in the option.\n\nOption D) 3,000,000 km would be the answer if we ignored relativistic effects (`d = v * Δt' = 60,000 * 50`), which is incorrect because the time and distance are measured in different reference frames.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is found by accounting for time dilation.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\nTo determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame, we must use the time that has passed in that same reference frame. The problem provides the time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (50 seconds), which is the proper time. We need to use the principle of time dilation from special relativity to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   Relative velocity (v) = 60,000 km/s\n    *   Proper time in the ejecta's frame (Δt₀) = 50 s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor determines the extent of time dilation and is calculated with the formula `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n    *   Now, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)\n\n3.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):** The time dilation formula states that the time measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) is the proper time multiplied by the Lorentz factor: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s\n\n4.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d):** The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n    *   d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s\n    *   d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nComparing this result to the given options, 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
