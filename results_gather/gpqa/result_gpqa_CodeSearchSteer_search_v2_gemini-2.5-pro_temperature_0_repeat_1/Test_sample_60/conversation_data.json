    "The step-by-step synthesis is as follows:\n\n1.  **Benzene to Product 1 (Nitrobenzene)**: Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The sulfuric acid protonates the nitric acid to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is the electrophile that reacts with benzene to form nitrobenzene.\n\n2.  **Product 1 to Product 2 (3-bromonitrobenzene)**: Nitrobenzene is treated with bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst, such as iron powder (which forms FeBr3 in situ). The nitro group (-NO2) is a deactivating and meta-directing group for electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the position meta to the nitro group, yielding 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n\n3.  **Product 2 to Product 3 (3-bromoaniline)**: 3-bromonitrobenzene is reduced using palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. This catalytic hydrogenation selectively reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2) without affecting the carbon-bromine bond. The resulting product is 3-bromoaniline.\n\n4.  **Product 3 to Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate)**: 3-bromoaniline is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4). This process, called diazotization, converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt. The product is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.\n\n5.  **Product 4 to Product 5 (3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl)**: The diazonium salt (Product 4) is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which is an aryl-aryl coupling reaction involving a diazonium salt and another aromatic compound. The diazonium salt forms a 3-bromophenyl radical. Anisole's methoxy group (-OCH3) is an activating, ortho, para-director. The radical substitution will preferentially occur at the para position due to less steric hindrance. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the two aromatic rings, yielding the final product, 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\nTherefore, the final product matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
