    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we can use the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Components\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   With 3 neutrons, the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n### 2. Relativistic Energy Formula\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\nE = γ * E₀\nwhere:\n*   E₀ is the rest energy of the particle (E₀ = m₀c²).\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe speed (v) is given as 0.96c.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)\nTo find the rest energy, we sum the rest masses of the nucleus's constituents (3 protons and 3 neutrons).\n*   The rest mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c².\n*   The rest mass of a neutron is approximately 939.566 MeV/c².\n\nThe combined rest mass (m₀) is:\n*   m₀ = (3 * 938.272 MeV/c²) + (3 * 939.566 MeV/c²)\n*   m₀ = 3 * (938.272 + 939.566) MeV/c²\n*   m₀ = 3 * (1877.838) MeV/c²\n*   m₀ = 5633.514 MeV/c²\n\nThe rest energy E₀ is therefore 5633.514 MeV, which is equal to 5.6335 GeV.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Energy (E)\nNow, we can calculate the total energy:\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.1196 GeV\n\nThis calculated value of 20.1196 GeV is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
