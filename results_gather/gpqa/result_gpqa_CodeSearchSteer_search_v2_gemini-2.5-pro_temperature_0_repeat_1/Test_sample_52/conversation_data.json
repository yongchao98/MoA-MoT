    "The chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Components from the Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. This core structure is C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic-H:** Two signals for aromatic hydrogens are consistent with the C6H4 di-substituted ring.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl hydrogen. The second vinyl hydrogen is split into a doublet by the first vinyl hydrogen and into a quartet by the three hydrogens of the adjacent methyl group. This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **1H NMR - –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct signals for methyl groups. One methyl group is part of the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must be the remaining part of the ester, making it a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or part of an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`).\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** The absence of signals for methylene groups confirms that there are no `-CH2-` fragments in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n    Based on the fragments identified, we can construct a plausible structure. The di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) must be attached to two substituents. The evidence points to these substituents being the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) and an ester group containing a methyl group.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1:** The substituents are a propenyl group and a methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`).\n    *   **Possibility 2:** The substituents are a propenyl group and an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n\n    Let's calculate the molecular formula for either possibility:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4):** 6 carbons, 4 hydrogens\n    *   **Propenyl Group (C3H5):** 3 carbons, 5 hydrogens\n    *   **Ester part (either -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3):** 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, 2 oxygens\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** 2\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectral data lead to the same molecular formula: **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The degree of unsaturation (DBE) for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\n    DBE = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6.\n    This matches the unsaturation in the proposed structure:\n    *   1 for the benzene ring (4 DBEs)\n    *   1 for the vinyl C=C double bond (1 DBE)\n    *   1 for the ester C=O double bond (1 DBE)\n    *   Total DBE = 6.\n\nThe other formula options are inconsistent with the spectral data. For instance, C12H14O2 would require an additional CH2 group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
