    "Analyzing the options provided:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** By definition, this planet has the same average density as Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For a planet with the same composition, a significant increase in mass leads to a stronger gravitational force. This increased gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be greater than Earth's density of 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will have weaker gravity. This leads to less compression of its materials compared to Earth, resulting in a lower overall density. Its density will be less than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the densities:\n*   Planet (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (c) > 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (d) < 5.5 g/cm³\n\nThe planet described in option (c) will have the highest density due to the compressive effect of its greater mass.\n\n<<<B>>>"
