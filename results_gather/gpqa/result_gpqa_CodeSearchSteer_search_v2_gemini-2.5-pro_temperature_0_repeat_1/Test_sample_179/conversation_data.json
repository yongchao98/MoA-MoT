    "The problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical charges. One charge is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 are constrained to a spherical surface of radius 2 m centered at P. The total electrostatic potential energy of this system is the sum of two components: the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere, and the interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy, the 12 charges on the sphere will arrange themselves to maximize their separation. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed within the sphere.\n\nThe total energy U of the system can be calculated as follows:\nU = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere\n\n**1. Energy of Interaction between the Central Charge and the 12 Sphere Charges (U_center_sphere):**\n\nEach of the 12 charges (q) on the sphere is at a distance R = 2 m from the central charge (also q). The potential energy for each pair is (k * q^2) / R, where k is Coulomb's constant.\n*   Charge of each particle, q = 2e = 2 * (1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204 x 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   Distance, R = 2 m\n*   Coulomb's constant, k ≈ 8.98755 x 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²\n\nU_center_sphere = 12 * (k * q²) / R\n\n**2. Energy of Interaction between the 12 Charges on the Sphere (U_sphere_sphere):**\n\nThe 12 charges form an icosahedron. The total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies for all 66 pairs of charges. In an icosahedron, the distances between vertices are not all equal. For any given vertex, there are:\n*   5 nearest neighbors at a distance d₁.\n*   5 next-nearest neighbors at a distance d₂.\n*   1 opposite vertex at a distance d₃ = 2R.\n\nThe distances d₁ and d₂ can be expressed in terms of the sphere's radius R and the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618.\n*   d₁ = 2R / √(1 + φ²)\n*   d₂ = 2φR / √(1 + φ²)\n\nThe total interaction energy of the charges on the sphere is the sum over all pairs:\nU_sphere_sphere = (k * q²) * [ (Number of pairs at d₁) / d₁ + (Number of pairs at d₂) / d₂ + (Number of pairs at d₃) / d₃ ]\nThere are 30 pairs at distance d₁, 30 pairs at distance d₂, and 6 pairs at distance d₃.\nU_sphere_sphere = k * q² * [ 30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/d₃ ]\n\n**Total Energy Calculation:**\n\nCombining both energy components:\nU_total = [12 * (k * q²) / R] + [k * q² * (30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/d₃)]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for d₁, d₂, and d₃:\nU_total = (k * q² / R) * [12 + 15√(1+φ²) + 15√(1+φ²)/φ + 3]\nU_total = (k * q² / R) * [15 + 15φ√(1+φ²)]\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n*   k ≈ 8.98755 x 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²\n*   q² ≈ (3.20435 x 10⁻¹⁹ C)² ≈ 1.02679 x 10⁻³⁷ C²\n*   R = 2 m\n*   φ ≈ 1.618034\n*   φ√(1+φ²) ≈ 3.07768\n\nU_total = ( (8.98755 x 10⁹ * 1.02679 x 10⁻³⁷) / 2 ) * [15 + 15 * 3.07768]\nU_total = (4.61425 x 10⁻²⁸) * [15 + 46.1652]\nU_total = (4.61425 x 10⁻²⁸) * 61.1652\nU_total ≈ 2.8224 x 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nRounding to three decimal places gives 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
