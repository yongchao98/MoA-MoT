    "This is a classic problem that requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The **laboratory frame** is the stationary observer's frame of reference.\n    *   The **glass's frame** is the moving frame of reference, which is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of light in the glass's own frame:**\n    In any medium with an index of refraction `n`, the speed of light `u'` within that medium's rest frame is given by the formula `u' = c/n`.\n    Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light as measured within the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Einstein velocity addition formula:**\n    When two velocities are in the same direction, the relativistic formula to find the resultant velocity `u` as seen by a stationary observer is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of light in the glass's own rest frame (`1/n`).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum (`1`).\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify the fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
