    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n    M₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nThe starting concentration of the acetic acid for the titration is **0.025 M**.\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** pH = pKa + log (\\[A⁻]/\\[HA])\n    *   Where \\[HA] is the concentration of the acid and \\[A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base.\n\nFirst, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n\n*   **Ka:** 1.85x10⁻⁵\n*   **pKa:** -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is 25/75, or 1/3.\n\n*   **pH:** 4.733 + log(25/75) = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n*   **pH:** 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\n**a. Moles and Volume at Equivalence:**\nFirst, we find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid:** 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume at Equivalence:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n**b. Concentration of Acetate:**\nThe concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point is:\n*   **[CH₃COO⁻]:** 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n**c. Hydrolysis and Kb:**\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction.\n*   **Kw (at 25 °C):** 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   **Kb:** Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n**d. Calculating [OH⁻]:**\nWe set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n*   Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻]\n*   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Assuming x is very small, we can simplify: 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n*   x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n**e. Calculating pH:**\n*   **pOH:** -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   **pH:** 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
