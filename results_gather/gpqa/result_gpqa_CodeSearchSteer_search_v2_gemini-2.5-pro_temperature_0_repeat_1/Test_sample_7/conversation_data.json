  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This indicates that gene G1 contributes to the resistance, and its loss leads to a partial reduction in resistance (25% loss).\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This shows that gene G2 is essential for resistance. Its loss leads to a complete loss of the resistance phenotype.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. Gene G3 also contributes to resistance, and its loss causes a significant (50%) reduction.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants and Gene Interactions\n\n1.  **Interaction with G2:**\n    *   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n    *   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance.\n\n    In both cases, the phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). When the phenotype of a double mutant is the same as one of the single mutants, this indicates an epistatic interaction. Specifically, the gene whose single-mutant phenotype is observed in the double mutant is considered epistatic to the other gene. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n\n    This epistatic relationship strongly suggests that G2 functions upstream of G1 and G3 in the same biological pathway. Given that the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the most logical candidate for this role, as it appears to control the pathway required for resistance.\n\n2.  **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n\n    The resistance level of the g1g3 double mutant (10%) is much lower than that of either the g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) single mutants. This is not a simple additive effect of the loss of resistance. Instead, the combined loss of G1 and G3 results in a much more severe phenotype than the loss of either gene alone. This type of interaction, where two genes have overlapping functions and the simultaneous loss of both is more detrimental than the individual losses, is known as gene redundancy or synthetic aggravation. It implies that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a partially overlapping or parallel manner.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** The conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor is plausible. However, the data does not provide direct evidence for a shared promoter, and G3 is not epistatic to G1 because the double mutant's phenotype (10%) is different from the g3 mutant's (50%).\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor is plausible. However, pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment as only one trait was measured. Also, G1 is not epistatic to G3 because the double mutant's phenotype (10%) differs from the g1 mutant's (75%).\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G2, not G1, is the likely transcription factor due to its severe phenotype and epistatic relationship over the other genes. While G2 is indeed epistatic to G1, the premise that G1 is the transcription factor is flawed.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and accurately describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is inconsistent with the data, as the g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%). However, the first two statements in this option are the most accurate and significant conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment. Among the given choices, this option provides the best overall description of the genetic network.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate conclusions are that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, and that G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. Option D is the only one that captures these two key points.\n\n<<<D>>>"
