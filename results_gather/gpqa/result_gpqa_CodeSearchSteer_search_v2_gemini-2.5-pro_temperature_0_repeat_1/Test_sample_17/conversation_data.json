    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the notation:** The notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements X and Y in a star compared to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n    `[X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y)_star - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun`\n    where `N_X` and `N_Y` are the number of atoms of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\n2.  **Relate abundances to Hydrogen:** A useful property of this notation is that abundances can be related through hydrogen (H):\n    `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Silicon abundance for Star_1:**\n    We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`.\n    Using the relation from step 2:\n    `[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    `0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\n    Therefore, the silicon abundance of Star_1 relative to the Sun is:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Silicon abundance for Star_2:**\n    We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`.\n    Using the relation from step 2 again:\n    `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    `0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n    Therefore, the silicon abundance of Star_2 relative to the Sun is:\n    `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of Silicon abundances:**\n    The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In the context of stellar abundances, this refers to the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen, which is `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\n    From the definition of `[Si/H]`:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun = 0.3`\n    `[Si/H]_2 = log10(nSi/nH)_2 - log10(nSi/nH)_sun = -0.3`\n\n    To find the ratio `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`, we can subtract the second equation from the first:\n    `log10((nSi/nH)_1) - log10((nSi/nH)_2) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2`\n    `log10( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 ) = 0.3 - (-0.3)`\n    `log10( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 ) = 0.6`\n\n    Now, we solve for the ratio by taking the antilogarithm (10 to the power of):\n    `Ratio = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^0.6`\n\n6.  **Compute the final value:**\n    `10^0.6 â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\n    This value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information regarding the stellar masses and the absolute solar abundances of Fe and Mg is extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~12.6\nB) ~3.9\nC) ~0.8\nD) ~1.2\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
