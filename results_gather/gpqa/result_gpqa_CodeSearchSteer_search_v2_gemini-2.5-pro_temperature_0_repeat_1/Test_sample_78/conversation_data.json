    "### Analysis of the Reaction and Product\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The starting material, Compound X (C11H12O), is one of the provided oxirane (epoxide) options. It undergoes a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) at 403 K (130 °C). Scientific literature confirms that DABCO, a nucleophilic organic base, catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of terminal epoxides that have an adjacent aryl or vinyl group. This specific reaction chemospecifically converts terminal epoxides into methyl ketones. The reaction conditions given in the problem are consistent with those reported for this transformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon. This confirms the product is a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two methyl singlets (δ 2.28 and 2.31), a pair of doublets for a p-disubstituted aromatic ring (δ 7.08 and 7.71), and another pair of doublets characteristic of a trans-alkene (δ 6.75 and 7.68).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The product is a ketone with the formula C11H12O. The NMR data strongly suggest the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ketone containing a p-tolyl group. The only structure that fits all these features is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n        *   **Structure:** (p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n        *   **¹H NMR assignment:** Two methyl singlets (acetyl-CH₃ and tolyl-CH₃), two vinyl doublets (-CH=CH-), and two aromatic doublets (p-disubstituted ring). This pattern perfectly matches the experimental data.\n        *   **¹³C NMR assignment:** The spectrum shows 9 distinct signals, which corresponds to the 11 carbons of the proposed structure (accounting for the symmetry of the p-substituted ring). The signals for a ketone, two methyl groups, and six sp² carbons are all present in the expected regions.\n\n3.  **Determine the Starting Material (Compound X):**\n    *   The identified product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   According to the DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangement, a methyl ketone of the structure R-C(=O)CH₃ is formed from a terminal epoxide with the structure R-CH(O)CH₂.\n    *   In our case, the product is (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH)-C(=O)CH₃. Therefore, the R group is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-.\n    *   The corresponding starting epoxide must be R-CH(O)CH₂, which is (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH)-CH(O)CH₂. This is named **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Has the wrong carbon skeleton and would not produce the observed NMR pattern.\n        *   B) 2-styrylepoxide: Has the wrong molecular formula (C₁₀H₁₀O).\n        *   C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: This matches our deduced starting material. Its formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n        *   D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: This is an internal, not a terminal, epoxide and would not rearrange to a methyl ketone under these conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction is a DABCO-catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement of a terminal vinyloxirane to an α,β-unsaturated methyl ketone. Analysis of the product's NMR spectra identifies it as 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Tracing this product back through the known reaction mechanism leads to 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane as the only possible starting material among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
