    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must first find the apparent V magnitude for each star and then compare it to the limiting magnitudes of both instruments. According to the problem description, a star is observable if its apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Therefore, for a star to be observed by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.\n\nThe analysis for each star is as follows:\n\n*   **Star 1:** This star has an absolute V magnitude (M_V) of 15.5 and is at a distance (d) of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude (m_V) can be calculated using the distance modulus formula: m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d/10).\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 mag.\n    *   Since 15.5 is less than 16, Star 1 is observable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star 2:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag.\n    *   Since 16.5 is not less than 16, Star 2 cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 3:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. The additional information about color excess is not needed as the final apparent magnitude is provided.\n    *   Since 15.5 is less than 16, Star 3 is observable by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star 4:** This star has an absolute V magnitude (M_V) of 15.5, a distance (d) of 10 parsecs, and a color excess E(B-V) of 0.4 mag. We must account for interstellar extinction (A_V), which dims the star. The extinction is calculated as A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). The full distance modulus formula is m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V.\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   Since 16.74 is not less than 16, Star 4 cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 5:** This star has an absolute V magnitude (M_V) of 16.5 and is at a distance (d) of 5 parsecs.\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) â‰ˆ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   Since 14.995 is less than 16, Star 5 is observable by both instruments.\n\nBased on these calculations, Star 1, Star 3, and Star 5 are all observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Reviewing the given options, the only pair where both stars are observable is Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
