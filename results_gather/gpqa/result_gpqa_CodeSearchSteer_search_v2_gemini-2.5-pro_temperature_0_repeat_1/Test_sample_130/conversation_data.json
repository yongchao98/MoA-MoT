    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:** The reaction is between a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to its anhydride, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    *   The *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is **maleic anhydride**. The provided NMR data (¹H: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) confirms this structure.\n    *   The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This molecule has four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. A cyclic diene reacting with a dienophile typically yields two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct. The *endo* product is generally the major product because it is formed faster (the kinetic product), while the *exo* product is the minor, more thermodynamically stable product. The problem states a major and a minor product are formed, consistent with *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products:** Let's predict the proton signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the adducts.\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_a):** The two protons from maleic anhydride become bridgehead protons in the product. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent and should appear as a **2H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons (Me_vinyl):** The two methyl groups on the newly formed double bond (from C2 and C3 of the diene) are equivalent. They should appear as a **6H singlet**. Their typical chemical shift is around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Me_bridgehead):** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons (from C1 and C4 of the diene) are also equivalent. They should appear as another **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is expected to be around **~1.0 ppm**, typical for saturated alkyl groups.\n    *   **Methylene Bridge Protons (H_bridge):** The two protons from the C5 position of the diene form a CH₂ bridge. They are diastereotopic and would give a more complex signal, which is not described in the options.\n\n4.  **Understand the NOESY Experiment:** A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product (*endo*) but absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*). This means we must identify two sets of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Compare *Endo* and *Exo* Geometries:**\n    *   ***Endo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the methylene (CH₂) bridge. In this configuration, the anhydride protons (H_a) are spatially close to the protons on the bridge side of the molecule.\n    *   ***Exo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the methylene bridge. In this configuration, the anhydride protons (H_a) are far from the protons on the bridge side.\n\n6.  **Identify the Differentiating NOE Interaction:** The key NOE interaction that distinguishes the *endo* from the *exo* isomer involves the anhydride protons (H_a).\n    *   In the ***endo*** isomer, H_a (~3.5 ppm) are close to the bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead, ~1.0 ppm).\n    *   In the ***exo*** isomer, H_a (~3.5 ppm) are far from the bridgehead methyl groups. Instead, they are closer to the vinyl methyl groups (Me_vinyl, ~1.7 ppm).\n\n7.  **Match the Observation to the Options:** The problem states the cross-peak is present in the major (*endo*) product. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons (H_a) and the protons they are close to in the *endo* form. However, an interaction between H_a (~3.5 ppm) and Me_bridgehead (~1.0 ppm) is not an option.\n\n8.  **Re-evaluate the Chemical Shift Assignments:** Let's reconsider the options. The options provided are:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\n    Options B and D contain a \"1H doublet,\" which is inconsistent with the expected structure. We focus on A and C.\n\n    Let's re-examine Option C: An interaction between a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** and a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm is definitively the anhydride protons (H_a).\n    *   The 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm would correspond to one of the methyl group pairs.\n\n    As established, the NOE that is strong in the *endo* and weak in the *exo* is between the anhydride protons (H_a) and the bridgehead methyls (Me_bridgehead). If this interaction corresponds to Option C, it implies that the bridgehead methyls have a chemical shift of ~1.7 ppm.\n\n    While counterintuitive (as vinyl methyls are usually further downfield), the proximity of the electron-withdrawing anhydride group in the *endo* isomer could deshield the nearby bridgehead methyls, shifting them downfield from ~1.0 ppm to ~1.7 ppm. Conversely, the vinyl methyls might be shielded, shifting them upfield. Assuming this shift reassignment is correct due to the specific stereochemistry of the *endo* adduct is the most logical way to reconcile the experimental observation with the given options.\n\n    Therefore, the cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the anhydride protons (H_a) with the nearby bridgehead methyl protons.\n\n    *   **Anhydride protons (H_a):** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl protons (Me_bridgehead):** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (reassigned shift)\n\n    This matches the description in Option C.\n\nFinal check: The NOE is between the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) and a set of methyl groups. In the *endo* isomer, these protons are close to the bridgehead methyls. In the *exo* isomer, they are far from the bridgehead methyls but close to the vinyl methyls. Since the NOE is observed in the major (*endo*) product, it must be between the anhydride protons and the bridgehead methyls. Option C describes an interaction between the anhydride protons (2H at ~3.5 ppm) and a 6H singlet. This must be the signal for the bridgehead methyls, which therefore must be the singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
