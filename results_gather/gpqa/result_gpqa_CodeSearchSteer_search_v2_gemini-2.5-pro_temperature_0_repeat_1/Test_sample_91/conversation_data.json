    "The search results confirm that the method used for the calculation is correct. Specifically, the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be calculated using a Hess's Law cycle. The formula derived from this cycle is:\n\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements in their standard states) - (Sum of bond energies for the compound)\n\nThis is precisely the formula I used.\n\nLet's re-state the calculation steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the molecular formula and structure:**\n    The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    Molecular Formula: C12H22.\n\n2.  **Count the bonds:**\n    *   C-H bonds: 22\n    *   C-C single bonds: 9\n    *   C=C double bonds: 2\n\n3.  **Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound:**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound.\n    ΔH_atom(compound) = (22 * BE(C-H)) + (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C))\n    ΔH_atom(compound) = (22 * 400 kJ/mol) + (9 * 200 kJ/mol) + (2 * 300 kJ/mol)\n    ΔH_atom(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the elements:**\n    This is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (12 C(s) and 11 H2(g)).\n    ΔH_atom(elements) = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 * BE(H-H))\n    ΔH_atom(elements) = (12 * 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 * 100 kJ/mol)\n    ΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\n5.  **Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f):**\n    ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n    ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are:\n    A) 11200 kJ/mol\n    B) 1900 kJ/g\n    C) 67.4 kJ/mol\n    D) 11.44 kJ/g\n\n    The calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) does not directly match options A, B, or C in both value and unit. Option B has the correct number but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option D is in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n\n7.  **Convert the result to kJ/g:**\n    *   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Option A is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   Option B has the numerical value of the molar enthalpy but incorrect units, making it a physically incorrect value.\n*   Option C is incorrect.\n*   Option D is the correct value after converting the calculated molar enthalpy to the specified units of kJ/g.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
