    "The search results confirm my approach.\n\n1.  **Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution.** This is confirmed by multiple sources. The probability of a particle surviving for time *t* is given by an exponential distribution.\n2.  **The formula for decay probability is correct.** The probability of survival S(t) is e^(-λt), and the probability of decay P(t) is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n3.  **The exponential distribution is memoryless.** This is a key property. The formal definition is P(X > t + s | X > s) = P(X > t). This means the probability that an atom will decay in a future time interval is constant and not influenced by its past history. The time that has already passed (50 minutes in this case) does not affect the future probability.\n4.  **My calculation steps are correct.**\n    *   From P(100) = 0.32, we get the survival probability S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Since S(t) = e^(-λt), we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply P(150).\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).\n    *   We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^1.5.\n    *   So, P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n    *   This is approximately 44%.\n\nThe logic and calculations are sound and confirmed by the search results. The answer is 44%.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 48%\nB) 44%\nC) 40%\nD) 52%\n\nThe result matches option B.The problem describes a radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential probability distribution. A key feature of this type of distribution is its \"memoryless\" property. This means that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of how much time has already passed.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the survival and decay probabilities.**\n    The probability that an atom *survives* for a time *t* is given by the formula S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    Consequently, the probability that the atom *decays* within time *t* is P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find a key value.**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so P(100) = 0.32.\n    This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    Using the survival formula, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n\n3.  **Apply the memoryless property.**\n    The problem states that 50 minutes have passed without decay. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this information does not affect the future probability. The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the initial probability of it decaying in any 150-minute interval.\n\n4.  **Calculate the required probability.**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, which is P(150).\n    P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).\n    We can rewrite the exponent: -150λ = (-100λ) * 1.5.\n    So, P(150) = 1 - (e^(-100λ))^1.5.\n    From step 2, we know that e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n    Therefore, P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\n5.  **Final calculation.**\n    (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n    P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393 corresponds to 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
