    "To select the suitable reagents, let's analyze each reaction:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. It involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This initial attack forms an alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent 'A' serves as the proton source. An acidic workup (H₃O⁺) is a standard method to protonate the alkoxide and yield the hydroxyl group of the cyanohydrin. While the reaction can be performed under various pH conditions, using NaCN followed by an acidic workup is a common procedure.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water. The options for reagent 'B' are a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong acid (HCl). Strong acids like HCl are effective and commonly used for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction proceeds by protonating the nitrile, which makes it more susceptible to attack by water, eventually leading to the carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A** should be **H₃O⁺** for the protonation step in cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **B** should be **HCl** for the effective hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
