    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nFirst, we analyze the results from passing the gaseous mixture through the three tubes to identify the components and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced during the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution, also known as limewater, is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no such acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This indicates that a gas in the mixture reacted with copper, transferring its oxygen atoms. The mass increase is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This volume corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   This remaining gas is inert to all the reagents used, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Identifying the Salts and Reactions**\n\nThe decomposition produced only gases (H₂O, N₂, and an oxygen-containing gas) and the initial reactants were salts. This points towards the thermal decomposition of specific ammonium salts. Let's consider two common reactions:\n*   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) at temperatures around 200-250°C:\n    NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's hypothesize that the equimolar mixture consists of **Salt A = NH₄NO₂** and **Salt B = NH₄NO₃**. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt in the mixture.\n\nBased on this hypothesis, the decomposition would produce:\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₂: **n moles of N₂** and **2n moles of H₂O**.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₃: **n moles of N₂O** and **2n moles of H₂O**.\n\nThe total products would be **n moles of N₂**, **n moles of N₂O**, and **4n moles of H₂O**.\n\n### **3. Verifying the Hypothesis with Experimental Data**\n\nNow, let's check if this model matches the experimental results:\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):** The total moles of water produced are 4n. From our analysis, we know 0.2 mol of H₂O was formed.\n    *   4n = 0.2 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n\n*   **Gas reacting with Copper:** The gas N₂O reacts with hot copper as follows: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Our model predicts **n = 0.05 mol** of N₂O.\n    *   This would provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g. This perfectly matches the mass increase of tube №3.\n\n*   **Final Gas (N₂):** The final gas C is composed of the N₂ initially produced from the decomposition of NH₄NO₂ and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O in tube №3.\n    *   N₂ from NH₄NO₂ decomposition = n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   N₂ from N₂O reaction = n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This perfectly matches the moles of the final gas C.\n\n*   **Initial Mass:** Let's check if the initial mass of the mixture is correct.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\nThe hypothesis is fully consistent with all the provided data. Therefore, the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
