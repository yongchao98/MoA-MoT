    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which is in excess after neutralization.\n\n### 1. Calculate Initial Moles\n\n*   **CH3COOH (Weak Acid):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **HCl (Strong Acid):**\n    Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so moles of H+ = moles of HCl.\n    Moles H+ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Strong Base):**\n    Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two OH- ions for each formula unit: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    Moles Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    Moles OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### 2. Neutralization Reactions\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+) will react with the strong base (OH-).\n\n*   Initial moles H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n\nThe H+ ions will be completely neutralized by the OH- ions.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COOH available = 0.050 mol\n\nThe CH3COOH will be completely neutralized by the excess OH-.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with CH3COOH = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution has an excess of 0.050 moles of OH- ions, making it basic.\n\n### 3. Calculate Final Concentration and pH\n\nThe final pH is determined by the concentration of the excess OH- ions in the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final [OH-] Concentration:**\n    [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH-]\n    pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
