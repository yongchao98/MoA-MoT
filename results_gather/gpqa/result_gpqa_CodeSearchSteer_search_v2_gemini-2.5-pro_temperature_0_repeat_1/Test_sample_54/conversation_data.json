    "The provided 1H NMR data indicates the structure of the unknown organic compound. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the three protons on the methyl group of an acetate functional group (CH₃-COO-). The singlet multiplicity confirms there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These chemical shifts are in the typical region for vinylic protons, which are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This represents one of the vinylic protons. The large coupling constant (J-value) of 16.0 Hz is a key piece of information. Coupling constants for vinylic protons in a *trans* configuration are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, while *cis* protons show smaller coupling constants, usually between 6-15 Hz. The observed value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a *trans* arrangement across the double bond. This proton appears as a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This is the second vinylic proton. The \"doublet\" portion of its splitting pattern is due to coupling with the first vinylic proton (with the same J = 16.0 Hz coupling constant). The \"quartet\" portion indicates that it is also coupled to three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (3H). Its doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to a single proton, which is the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\nBased on this interpretation, the compound has an acetate group, a *trans*-disubstituted double bond, and a methyl group attached to that double bond. This structure is consistent with trans-propenyl acetate. The butenyl acetate options would have an additional CH₂ group, which is not observed in the spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
