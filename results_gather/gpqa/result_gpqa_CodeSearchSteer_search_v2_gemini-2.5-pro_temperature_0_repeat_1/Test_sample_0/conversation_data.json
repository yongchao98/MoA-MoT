    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than the energy uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each level. This energy uncertainty is fundamentally linked to the lifetime of the quantum state by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nThe time-energy uncertainty principle is given by the formula:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (the energy width of the state).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor a calculation, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the difference in their energies must be much larger than the broader of the two energy widths. The broader width corresponds to the state with the shorter lifetime, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow, let's compare this required energy difference with the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the energy uncertainty of both states.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of the first state (10⁻⁸ eV < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than the energy uncertainty of both states.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is several orders of magnitude larger than the energy uncertainties of both states (10⁻⁴ eV >> 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\nAn energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV would ensure that the two energy levels are well separated and do not overlap, allowing them to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<D>>>"
