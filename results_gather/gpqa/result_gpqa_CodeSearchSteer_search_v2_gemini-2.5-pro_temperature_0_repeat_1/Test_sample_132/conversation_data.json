    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).\n\n**1. Understand the components**\n\nThe solution contains:\n*   **KH₂PO₄** (potassium dihydrogen phosphate), which dissociates into K⁺ and the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻.\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O** (disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate), which dissociates into 2Na⁺ and the conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n\nThis mixture of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) forms a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of the acid and conjugate base**\n\n*   **Moles of H₂PO₄⁻** (from KH₂PO₄):\n    Moles = mass / molar mass\n    Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **Moles of HPO₄²⁻** (from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O):\n    Moles = mass / molar mass\n    Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations**\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻**:\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻**:\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]**\n\nThe pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair. The equilibrium expression is:\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸. We can rearrange the equilibrium constant expression to solve for [H⁺]:\n\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration**\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². The equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻], using the [H⁺] and [HPO₄²⁻] values we've already determined.\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
