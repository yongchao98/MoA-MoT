    "To find the energy spectrum of the particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nUsing the transformations to Cartesian coordinates, where x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ), we have r^2 = x^2 + y^2. We can substitute these into the potential energy equation:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The potential can be written as V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\n\nV_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 (k)y^2\n\nThis represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two independent one-dimensional oscillators.\n\nThe energy for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 k_z z^2 is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = sqrt(k_z/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\n\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\n\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The corresponding angular frequency is:\n\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\n\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\n\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
