    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials:\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe final product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring lactone (a cyclic ester). This type of molecule is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The starting materials provided in the options are all derivatives of 3-ethylglutaric acid, specifically (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5).\n\nTo form the lactone, one of the carbonyl groups must be reduced to an alcohol, which then reacts with the remaining carboxylic acid group. The selectivity of the reducing agent determines which end of the molecule is reduced.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at the C5 position of starting material **A** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group at the C1 position will remain largely unaffected.\n*   **Intermediate:** This selective reduction yields 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Final Step:** The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the stereocenter at the C3 position of the starting material (which becomes the C4 position in the lactone). Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃), often used as a complex with THF or dimethyl sulfide, is a reducing agent highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, even in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at the C1 position of starting material **B** to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group at the C5 position will remain intact.\n*   **Intermediate:** This reaction produces isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n*   **Final Step:** The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification reaction. The newly formed hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone ring and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the stereocenter is not altered. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
