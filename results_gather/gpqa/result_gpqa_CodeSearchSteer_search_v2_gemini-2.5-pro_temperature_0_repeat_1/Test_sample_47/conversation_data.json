    "The reaction sequence and the final product have been determined as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone)**\n    This is an alpha-bromination of a ketone, where a bromine atom attaches to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-Bromocyclohexanone + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid)**\n    This reaction is a Favorskii rearrangement. In the presence of a base like sodium hydroxide, α-halo ketones undergo a ring contraction. In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride)**\n    This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride using thionyl chloride. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl produced.\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), which prevents the over-reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to, bisecting the rest of the ring. This symmetry affects the equivalence of the hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde):** This hydrogen is also in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. On each of these carbons, there are two hydrogens. The hydrogen that is on the same side of the ring as the aldehyde group (cis) is equivalent to the corresponding cis-hydrogen on the other carbon. The same is true for the hydrogens on the opposite side (trans). Because the cis and trans protons have a different spatial relationship to the aldehyde group, they are distinct from each other (diastereotopic). This gives 2 signals for these four protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The four protons on these carbons also give rise to 2 distinct signals (one for the two cis-protons and one for the two trans-protons).\n\nIn total, adding up the distinct types of hydrogens: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
