    "To determine the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we must calculate ⟨ψ| (10σ_z + 5σ_x) |ψ⟩ for the given spin state.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nThe operator is:\nO = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\n\nThe expectation value ⟨O⟩ can be calculated as the sum of the expectation values of the individual terms:\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z⟩ + ⟨5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of σ_z:\nThe Pauli matrix σ_z acts on the eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as follows:\n*   σ_z|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩\n*   σ_z|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩\n\nThe expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩.\n⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) σ_z (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n= (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n= (0.5)²⟨↑|↑⟩ - (√3/2)²⟨↓|↓⟩\n= 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of σ_x:\nThe Pauli matrix σ_x acts on the eigenstates as follows:\n*   σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩\n*   σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩\n\nThe expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.\n⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) σ_x (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n= (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) (0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩)\n= (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩\n= √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the total expectation value:\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n= 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)\n= -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
