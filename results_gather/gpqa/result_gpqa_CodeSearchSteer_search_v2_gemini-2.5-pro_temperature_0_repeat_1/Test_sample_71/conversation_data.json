    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the reactive diene**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature. The structure of the starting material is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring with two dibromomethyl (-CHBr₂) groups on the adjacent sp³-hybridized carbons, C5 and C6.\n\nThe reaction of gem-dibromides with reagents like NaI or zinc dust is a method to form new carbon-carbon double bonds. In this case, the four bromine atoms are eliminated to form two new exocyclic double bonds. This process generates a highly reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylidene-1,3-cyclohexadiene. This molecule will act as the diene in the subsequent Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n**Step 1 (continued): Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe generated diene, 5,6-dimethylidene-1,3-cyclohexadiene, reacts with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative). The norbornadiene has two double bonds and acts as a dienophile. The problem states that two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, which implies that a Diels-Alder reaction occurs on both double bonds of the norbornadiene. This double cycloaddition reaction forms a complex polycyclic molecule, **product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrolysis**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard condition for the hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at the C7 position of the norbornane skeleton is converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH). This forms **product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Oxidation**\n\nProduct 2, which is a secondary alcohol, is treated with the Parikh-Doering reagent (SO₃•pyridine in DMSO). This is a mild oxidizing agent that converts the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O). This yields **product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Thermolysis and Identification of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is heated to 150°C. The core of product 3 is a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-7-one with two large ring systems fused to it from the Diels-Alder reactions. Heating a Diels-Alder adduct typically causes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking the adduct back into its original diene and dienophile components.\n\nIn this case, the thermolysis of product 3 will cause a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction, releasing two molecules of the diene (5,6-dimethylidene-1,3-cyclohexadiene) and the dienophile part, which is now bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n\nThis intermediate, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination at elevated temperatures to lose a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene (C₆H₆).\n\nSo, the final reaction mixture contains benzene, carbon monoxide, and the regenerated diene, 5,6-dimethylidene-1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on **product 4**. While benzene is a final product, it has only one type of chemically distinct hydrogen atom due to its high symmetry, and '1' is not an option. This suggests that \"product 4\" refers to the other major organic product present in the final mixture, which is the regenerated diene.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (5,6-dimethylidene-1,3-cyclohexadiene)**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of 5,6-dimethylidene-1,3-cyclohexadiene to count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\nThe molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the middle of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry helps in identifying equivalent protons.\n\nThe molecule has a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The protons on C1 and C4 are equivalent due to the C₂ symmetry. This is the first set of distinct protons.\n    *   The protons on C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other. This is the second set.\n*   **Methylene Protons (=CH₂):**\n    *   The two methylene groups (=CH₂) at C5 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   However, within a single methylene group (e.g., at C5), the two protons are not equivalent. They are in different chemical environments (diastereotopic). One proton is closer to the C4 side of the ring, and the other is closer to the C6 side.\n    *   Therefore, the \"inner\" protons of the two methylene groups are equivalent to each other (forming the third set), and the \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other (forming the fourth set).\n\nIn total, there are four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n1.  H1 and H4\n2.  H2 and H3\n3.  The two \"inner\" methylene protons\n4.  The two \"outer\" methylene protons\n\nThus, there are 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
