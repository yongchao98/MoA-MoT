    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Conditions for Transit and Occultation:** For a planet in a circular orbit, if it transits its star (passes in front of it from our perspective), it will also be occulted by its star (pass behind it). The key condition for a transit to occur is determined by the impact parameter, `b`. The impact parameter is the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center at the point of closest approach, normalized by the star's radius. A transit occurs if `b ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Use Information from Planet 1:** We are given that the first planet has a transit impact parameter `b₁ = 0.2`. The formula for the impact parameter is:\n    `b₁ = (a₁ * cos(i)) / Rₛ = 0.2`\n    Where `a₁` is the semi-major axis of the first planet, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `Rₛ` is the star's radius.\n\n3.  **Apply the Condition to Planet 2:** The second planet shares the same orbital plane, meaning it has the same inclination `i`. It also orbits the same star, so `Rₛ` is the same. For the second planet to exhibit a transit, its impact parameter `b₂` must be less than or equal to 1:\n    `b₂ = (a₂ * cos(i)) / Rₛ ≤ 1`\n    Where `a₂` is the semi-major axis of the second planet.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** We can find a relationship between the semi-major axes of the two planets. From the equation for Planet 1, we can express the constant geometric factor `cos(i) / Rₛ` as `0.2 / a₁`. Now, substitute this into the inequality for Planet 2:\n    `a₂ * (0.2 / a₁) ≤ 1`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `a₂ ≤ a₁ / 0.2`\n    `a₂ ≤ 5 * a₁`\n    This means the maximum possible semi-major axis for the second planet (`a₂_max`) is 5 times the semi-major axis of the first planet.\n\n5.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)`³\n    To find the maximum orbital period for the second planet (`P₂_max`), we use its maximum semi-major axis (`a₂_max`):\n    `(P₂_max / P₁)² = (a₂_max / a₁)`³\n    `(P₂_max / P₁)² = (5 * a₁ / a₁)`³\n    `(P₂_max / P₁)² = 5³ = 125`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Now, solve for `P₂_max`:\n    `P₂_max² = P₁² * 125`\n    `P₂_max = P₁ * √125`\n    Given that `P₁ = 3` days:\n    `P₂_max = 3 * √125 ≈ 3 * 11.18 ≈ 33.54` days.\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The information about the radii of the planets and the star is not needed for this calculation, assuming the standard definition of a transit (`b ≤ 1`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
