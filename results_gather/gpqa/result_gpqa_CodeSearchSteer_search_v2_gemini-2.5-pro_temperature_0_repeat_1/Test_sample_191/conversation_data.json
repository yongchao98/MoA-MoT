    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction on the Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity attracts free electrons from the conductor to the inner surface of the cavity. This results in an induced charge of `-q` on the surface of the small spherical cavity. The distribution of this induced charge `-q` will be non-uniform because the charge `+q` is not at the center of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the large spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. This means that the charges on the outer surface are \"shielded\" from the influence of the charges inside the cavity. Consequently, the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is independent of the position of the charge `+q` within the cavity.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface is a sphere and is isolated, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this surface due to mutual repulsion, seeking a state of minimum energy.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge on the shell were concentrated at its center.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. This charge is uniformly distributed on the sphere of radius `R`. Therefore, for any point P outside the sphere at a distance `L` from its center, the electric field `E` is given by the formula for a point charge `+q` located at the center of the conductor.\n\nThe formula is:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, and the angle `Î¸` are all related to the internal configuration, which does not affect the external electric field due to electrostatic shielding. Therefore, they are not part of the final expression for the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
