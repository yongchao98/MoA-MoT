    "### Breakdown of the Quantum Mechanics Problem\n\nTo determine the joint probability, we need to understand the principles of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n2.  **Coupled State:** The two electrons are in a specific coupled state, denoted by `|l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1, 1, 2, -1⟩`. Here, `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m=-1` is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n3.  **Measurement:** A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n4.  **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L₁z` as -ħ and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` as -ħ. In terms of magnetic quantum numbers, this corresponds to measuring `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### The Conservation of Angular Momentum's Z-Component\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. In operator form, this is expressed as:\n\n`Lz = L₁z + L₂z`\n\nThis relationship has a direct consequence for the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers. If the system is in a state with a total magnetic quantum number `m`, and the individual components have magnetic quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂`, then it must be that:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n### Applying the Principle to the Problem\n\nIn the given problem, the system is in the state `|l=2, m=-1⟩`. This means the total magnetic quantum number `m` is -1.\n\nThe measurement outcome we are interested in is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nLet's check if this outcome is consistent with the conservation principle:\n`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nThe sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers for the desired outcome is -2. However, the system's total magnetic quantum number is -1. Since `-2 ≠ -1`, this measurement outcome is physically impossible for a system in the given state.\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1⟩` is a superposition of states `|m₁, m₂⟩` for which `m₁ + m₂ = -1`. The possible combinations are `|m₁=0, m₂=-1⟩` and `|m₁=-1, m₂=0⟩`. The state corresponding to the measurement `m₁=-1` and `m₂=-1` is not part of this superposition. Therefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero.\n\nThe coefficients that determine the probability of measuring a specific `(m₁, m₂)` combination from a coupled state `|l, m⟩` are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `⟨l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m⟩` is zero unless `m₁ + m₂ = m`. Since `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`, the corresponding coefficient is zero, and the probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
