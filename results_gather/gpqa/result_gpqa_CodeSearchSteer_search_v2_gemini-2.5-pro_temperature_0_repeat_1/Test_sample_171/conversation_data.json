    "To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation can be written as:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in the excited state (energy E_b) and the ground state (energy E_a), respectively.\n*   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   ΔE = (E_b - E_a) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the total number of atoms for each star as follows:\n*   For star_1 with temperature T_1: (N_excited / N_total)_1 ∝ exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n*   For star_2 with temperature T_2: (N_excited / N_total)_2 ∝ exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Therefore, we can write the relationship:\n\n(N_excited / N_total)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_total)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann factors:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n\nln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate the ln(2) term:\n\nΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\nFactor out the common term ΔE / k:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into our derived equation:\n\n1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
