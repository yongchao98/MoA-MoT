    "To solve this problem, we must first understand the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for multiple spin-1/2 particles.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L', the allowed energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\n\nE_n = n² * (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the energy of the n-th level can be expressed as:\n\nE_n = n² * E\n\n### System of Four Spin-1/2 Particles\n\nThe particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level 'n' and the spin projection (spin up or spin down). This implies that each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** We can place two particles in this lowest energy level (one with spin up, one with spin down). Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level:** The remaining two particles are placed in the next lowest energy level. Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy (E_ground) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nThe first excited state is the lowest possible energy state above the ground state. To achieve this, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the next available unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** Two particles remain, with a total energy of 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level:** One particle remains, with an energy of 1 * E₂ = 1 * (2² * E) = 4E.\n*   **n = 3 level:** One particle is promoted to this level, with an energy of 1 * E₃ = 1 * (3² * E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state (E_first_excited) is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. We must consider the possible promotions from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state. The lowest energy transition to achieve this involves moving one particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level, resulting in a configuration different from the first excited state.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** One particle remains, with an energy of 1 * E₁ = 1 * (1² * E) = E.\n*   **n = 2 level:** Two particles remain, with a total energy of 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 8E.\n*   **n = 3 level:** One particle is promoted to this level, with an energy of 1 * E₃ = 1 * (3² * E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the second excited state (E_second_excited) is:\nE_second_excited = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nAnother possibility would be to promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3, which would give an energy of 2*E1 + 2*E3 = 2E + 18E = 20E. Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 would yield 2*E1 + 1*E2 + 1*E4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Since 18E is the lowest energy above the first excited state, it is the energy of the second excited state.\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
