    "The search results confirm the fundamental relationship between distance (r or d) and parallax (p or plx): `d = 1/p`. They also explain that the number of stars for which parallax can be measured is limited by distance. However, they do not directly address the distribution of stars as a function of parallax or distance, which is the core of the user's question. The initial derivation remains the most logical approach.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation again to ensure clarity before presenting the final answer.\n\n1.  **Define the given information:** The number of stars per unit parallax interval, let's call it `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n2.  **Define the goal:** Find how the number of stars per unit distance interval, `dN/dr`, relates to the distance `r`.\n\n3.  **State the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax:** Distance is inversely proportional to parallax.\n    *   `r ∝ 1/plx` or `plx ∝ 1/r`. For simplicity, we can write `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule to relate the two distributions:**\n    *   `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r`, then `d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2`.\n    *   We are interested in the magnitude of the relationship, so we can ignore the negative sign, which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases.\n    *   `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation:**\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express everything in terms of `r`:** Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nThis confirms that the number of stars per unit range of distance `r` varies as `r^3`. This corresponds to option B.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The interpretation of \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" as the density function `dN/d(plx)` is standard in such physics and astronomy problems. The mathematical derivation using the chain rule is sound. The result `dN/dr ∝ r^3` is the logical consequence.\n\nThe relationship between the number of stars and distance is derived from the given relationship between the number of stars and parallax.\n\n1.  **Given:** The number of stars as a function of parallax (plx) is given by `N ∝ 1/plx^5`. This is interpreted as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, so `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n2.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The distance `r` to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax.\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n3.  **Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, which is `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Transformation of Variables:** We can use the chain rule to relate the two derivatives:\n    `dN/dr = dN/d(plx) * d(plx)/dr`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative of parallax with respect to distance:**\n    Since `plx = 1/r`, the derivative is:\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2`\n    As we are interested in how the number density changes, we can consider the magnitude, so `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`.\n\n6.  **Substitute the known relations:**\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express in terms of distance `r`:** Now, substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/(1/r)^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^5 * (1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as `r^3`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
