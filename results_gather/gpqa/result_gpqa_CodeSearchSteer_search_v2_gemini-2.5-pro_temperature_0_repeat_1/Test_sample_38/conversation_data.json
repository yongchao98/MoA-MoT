    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. This is expressed mathematically by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\nThe given wave function is a complex function:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe probability density, |Ψ(x)|², is found by multiplying the wave function by its complex conjugate. For a complex function of the form A + Bi, the square of the modulus is A² + B². In this case, A = a / sqrt(1 + x) and B = -0.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability density is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nWe are told that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This means we must integrate the probability density function from 1 to 3, and the result must be equal to 1.\n\nThe normalization integral is:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can solve this integral by breaking it into two parts:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx\n\nThe first part of the integral is:\na² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n= a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B), this simplifies to:\n= a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\nThe second part of the integral is:\n[0.25 * x] from 1 to 3\n= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1\n= 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\nNow, we combine the results and set them equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNext, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of the natural logarithm of 2, which is approximately 0.693.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
