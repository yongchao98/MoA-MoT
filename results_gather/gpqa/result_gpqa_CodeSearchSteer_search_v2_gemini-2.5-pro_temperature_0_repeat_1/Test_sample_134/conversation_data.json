    "For a decay of a particle to be kinematically allowed, its mass must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products. The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV and is decaying into a fermion-antifermion pair ($X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$). Since a fermion and its corresponding antifermion have identical masses ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition for the decay to be possible is:\n\n$m_X > 2 \\cdot m_f$\n\nGiven that $m_X = 6 \\text{ GeV}$, the condition becomes:\n\n$6 \\text{ GeV} > 2 \\cdot m_f$\n\nor\n\n$m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis means that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of the individual fermion is less than 3 GeV. Let's examine the masses of the fundamental fermions to determine the allowed decays.\n\n**Lepton Masses:**\n*   **Electron ($e$):** The mass is approximately 0.511 MeV/c², which is 0.000511 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** The mass is approximately 105.7 MeV/c², which is 0.1057 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** The mass is approximately 1777 MeV/c², which is 1.777 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n\n**Quark Masses:**\n*   **Up ($u$):** The mass is approximately 2.0 MeV/c², which is 0.002 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Down ($d$):** The mass is approximately 4.7 MeV/c², which is 0.0047 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Strange ($s$):** The mass is approximately 95 MeV/c², which is 0.095 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Charm ($c$):** The mass is approximately 1.27 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV.\n*   **Bottom ($b$):** The mass is approximately 4.18 GeV/c². This is **greater** than 3 GeV.\n*   **Top ($t$):** The mass is approximately 173 GeV/c², which is 173 GeV/c². This is **greater** than 3 GeV.\n\nBased on this analysis, the decays of the X boson that are kinematically allowed are into pairs of electrons, muons, taus, and up, down, strange, and charm quarks. The decays into bottom and top quarks are forbidden because their masses are too high.\n\nThe complete list of allowed decays is therefore:\n$X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, s\\bar{s}, c\\bar{c}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay into a bottom-antibottom pair.\nB) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay into a top-antitop pair.\nC) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Correct as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays and excludes the forbidden ones.\nD) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect because it includes the forbidden decay into a bottom-antibottom pair.\n\n<<<C>>>"
