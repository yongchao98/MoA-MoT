    "The derivation I performed seems sound and is a standard approach for this type of problem. The search results confirm that the concept of a relativistic harmonic oscillator is well-studied and that energy conservation principles are applied. Specifically, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is the relativistic kinetic energy, and the total energy also includes the rest mass energy.\n\nMy derivation:\n1.  **Total energy at maximum displacement (x=A):** The particle is momentarily at rest (v=0), so its kinetic energy is zero. The total energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n    *   E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\n2.  **Total energy at equilibrium position (x=0):** The potential energy is zero. The particle has its maximum velocity (v=v_max), and its total energy is its relativistic energy.\n    *   E_total = γ_max * mc² = (1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) * mc²\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:** Equating the two expressions for the total energy.\n    *   mc² + (1/2)kA² = (1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) * mc²\n\n4.  **Solving for v_max:**\n    *   1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)\n    *   sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))\n    *   1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n    *   v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n    *   v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²)\n\nThis matches option A exactly. The other options are dimensionally incorrect or based on incorrect energy expressions. For instance, option B is the non-relativistic answer. Options C and D would lead to speeds greater than c, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the derived answer is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>"
