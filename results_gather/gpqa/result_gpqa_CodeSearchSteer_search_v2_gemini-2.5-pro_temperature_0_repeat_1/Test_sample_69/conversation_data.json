    "This is a chemical puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each substance.\n\n1.  **Identify D, B, and H**: Reaction 4 states that gas D and gas B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. A common example of such a reaction is the addition of chlorine (Cl₂) to ethylene (C₂H₄) to produce 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂), which is a widely used solvent. Let's assume:\n    *   **D = C₂H₄ (Ethylene)**\n    *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)**\n\n2.  **Identify A and C**: Reaction 1 states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) to form bright red product C. Let's consider A to be elemental sulfur (S₈), which is a solid. The reaction of sulfur with chlorine can produce sulfur dichloride (SCl₂). The overall reaction can be written as S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂. This fits the 1:8 stoichiometry between A (S₈) and B (Cl₂). Sulfur dichloride is described as a cherry-red liquid. Thus, we can identify:\n    *   **A = S₈ (Sulfur)**\n    *   **C = SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)**\n\n3.  **Verify with Reaction 3**: This reaction states that C reacts with water to reform A, plus a strong acid F and a weak acid G. Let's check the hydrolysis of C (SCl₂). The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride is a disproportionation reaction that produces elemental sulfur (S), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃).\n    *   `2SCl₂ + 3H₂O → S + H₂SO₃ + 4HCl` (a simplified representation)\n    *   This fits the description: A (Sulfur) is reformed. F (strong acid) is HCl. G (weak acid) is H₂SO₃. This confirms our assignments for A and C.\n\n4.  **Identify E**: Reaction 2 states that C (SCl₂) reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (C₂H₄) to produce the extremely hazardous product E. This describes the Levinstein process for producing mustard gas.\n    *   `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`\n    *   **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard gas)**, which is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**: The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E, mustard gas (S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂). The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to the geometry around the sulfur atom and free rotation around the single bonds, the molecule adopts a conformation that is not planar. The most stable conformation possesses a single two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom. It does not have any planes of symmetry. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group is C₂.\n\nBased on this deduction, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
