    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. The reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Without specific conditions favoring one over the other, we will consider the major product, which is often the para isomer due to less steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\nThis step involves the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ are commonly used to convert the methyl group of nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ in acidic conditions can also be used. However, it is also a known reagent for the more selective oxidation of benzylic methyl groups to aldehydes. For the subsequent reaction with acetone to be plausible, an aldehyde is required. Therefore, it is most likely that the methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone. The hydroxide (NaOH) removes an acidic alpha-proton from acetone to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nThe structure of product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is a planar molecule due to the extensive conjugation between the benzene ring, the carbon-carbon double bond, and the carbonyl group. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we look for its symmetry elements:\n\n*   **Identity (E):** Present in all molecules.\n*   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** There are no rotational axes. A C₂ axis passing through the bonds of the side chain and the ring is absent because one end has a methyl group and the other has a nitro group.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Because the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms is a plane of symmetry. There are no other symmetry planes.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
