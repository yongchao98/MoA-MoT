    "To determine the correct option, we need to analyze the properties of the given compounds.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) that can migrate.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds (sp2 hybridized). While these carbons have hydrogen atoms, their removal to form an enol would create a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has alpha-hydrogens on saturated carbon atoms between the ketone groups. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic, which strongly favors the tautomerization process.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at the 2-position) bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of existing as two optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, with the chemical name dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule with a trans configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to its plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
