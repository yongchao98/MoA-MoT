    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (d), or semi-major axis (a). This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, which relates the orbital period (P) of a planet to its semi-major axis (a). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this, we can express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nBy substituting this relationship into the equilibrium temperature formula, we find how the equilibrium temperature depends on the orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√(P^(2/3)) = 1/P^(1/3)\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4)]^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. Thus, we can set the orbital period of Planet_2 (P₂) as 2 and the orbital period of Planet_4 (P₄) as 3.5 in arbitrary units.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
