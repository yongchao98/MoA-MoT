    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their point of view, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary information:\n*   **Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud:** The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Some measurements place it closer to 160,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the value that aligns with the provided options.\n*   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light).\n*   **Astronaut's age at the start:** 22 years.\n*   **Alien's average lifetime:** 150 years.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the travel time from Earth's perspective.**\nThe time it would take for the spacecraft to reach Earth as measured by an observer on Earth (Δt) is the distance divided by the speed.\n*   Time (Earth frame) = Distance / Speed\n*   Δt = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor is a key component in time dilation calculations and depends on the spacecraft's velocity. The formula is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / √(0.00000026)\n*   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut.**\nTime dilation causes time to pass more slowly for the moving astronaut relative to a stationary observer on Earth. The time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δτ) is calculated by dividing the time measured on Earth by the Lorentz factor.\n*   Time (Astronaut's frame) = Time (Earth frame) / γ\n*   Δτ = 160,000.02 years / 1961.16\n*   Δτ ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 81.58 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the astronaut's age upon arrival.**\nThe astronaut's age upon reaching Earth will be their starting age plus the time they experienced during the journey.\n*   Final Age = 22 years + 81.58 years = 103.58 years\n\nSince the astronaut's final age of approximately 104 years is less than their average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. The duration of the trip from the astronaut's perspective is approximately 81 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
