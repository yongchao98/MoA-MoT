    "When racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with a Grubbs catalyst, a self-metathesis reaction occurs, leading to the formation of ethene and 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The starting material is a racemic mixture, meaning it contains equal amounts of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nThe reaction can proceed in three different ways:\n1.  **Reaction between two (R)-enantiomers:** This produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n2.  **Reaction between two (S)-enantiomers:** This produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n3.  **Cross-metathesis between an (R)- and an (S)-enantiomer:** This produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\nFor each of these combinations, the newly formed double bond at the C4 position can have either an E (trans) or Z (cis) configuration. This leads to the following possible products:\n\n*   **(E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene** and **(Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**.\n*   **(E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene** and **(Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**. These are the enantiomers of the (3R, 6R) products. Together, these constitute four distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene** and **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**. Due to the symmetry in the molecule, these are meso compounds, which are achiral despite having chiral centers. They are diastereomers of each other and of the other four products.\n\nIn total, this results in six possible stereoisomeric products, excluding ethene: two pairs of enantiomers and two meso compounds.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 possible products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
