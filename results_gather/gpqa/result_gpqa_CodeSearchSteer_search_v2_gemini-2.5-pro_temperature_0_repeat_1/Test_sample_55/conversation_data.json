    "The problem asks for a valid decay route for a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two electric dipole transitions, and the probability associated with that specific route.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the selection rules for electric dipole transitions.\nFor an electric dipole transition between states $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and $|n',l',m'\\rangle$, the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0$ or $\\pm 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states.\nThe initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state where $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state where $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0 \\pm 1$ or $m'=0$. So, $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for a decay (emission) process. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the transition from the intermediate state to the final state.\nThe final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if the transition from the possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed.\n*   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$ (Allowed).\n*   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (Allowed).\n*   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n\nAll three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 4: Determine the probability of each decay route.\nThe probability of the atom taking a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to one of the three $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator between the initial and final states.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. This implies that the probability of transitioning to each of the possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$) is equal.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay paths, the probability for any single path is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This presents a valid route with the correct probability.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are given by option D.\n\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<D>>>"
