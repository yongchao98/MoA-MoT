    "Under the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space, we can determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with the parallax itself.\n\nFirst, let's establish the key relationships:\n\n1.  **Uniform Distribution**: A uniform distribution of stars means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's denote this constant density as ρ.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars and Distance**: For an observer, the number of stars (dN) within a thin spherical shell of radius 'r' and thickness 'dr' is the volume of that shell (dV = 4πr²dr) multiplied by the constant star density (ρ). Therefore, dN = 4πρr²dr.\n\n3.  **Parallax and Distance**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to a star. The relationship is given by the formula r = 1/plx, where 'r' is typically in parsecs and 'plx' in arcseconds.\n\nTo find how the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx)) depends on the parallax, we need to express the number of stars in terms of parallax.\n\nWe start with the expression for the number of stars in a thin shell:\ndN = 4πρr²dr\n\nNow, we substitute the distance 'r' with its parallax equivalent, r = 1/plx:\ndN = 4πρ(1/plx)²dr\n\nNext, we need to express 'dr' in terms of 'd(plx)'. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation r = 1/plx with respect to plx:\ndr/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n\nThis gives us dr = (-1/plx²)d(plx). The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our purpose of counting stars in a given parallax range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we use dr = (1/plx²)d(plx).\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for 'dr' back into our equation for dN:\ndN = 4πρ(1/plx)² * (1/plx²)d(plx)\n\nSimplifying this gives:\ndN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴)d(plx)\n\nTo find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by d(plx):\ndN/d(plx) = 4πρ/plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, we can see the proportionality:\ndN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
