    "The Cope rearrangement is a-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene. The reactant, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, is a nitrogen-containing analog, which will undergo an aza-Cope rearrangement.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Identify the 1,5-diene system:** The core structure for the rearrangement is a 3-aza-1,5-diene. Let's number the atoms involved in the sigmatropic shift:\n    *   Atom 1: The terminal CH₂ carbon of the vinyl group.\n    *   Atom 2: The CH carbon of the vinyl group, attached to the nitrogen.\n    *   Atom 3: The nitrogen atom at position 2 (N2).\n    *   Atom 4: The bridgehead carbon at position 1 (C1).\n    *   Atom 5: The carbon at position 6 (C6).\n    *   Atom 6: The carbon at position 5 (C5).\n\n    The system is thus C¹H₂=C²H-N³-C⁴-C⁵=C⁶.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the-sigmatropic rearrangement:**\n    *   The sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 (N2-C1) breaks.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between atoms 1 and 6 (the terminal vinyl carbon and C5).\n    *   The double bond between atoms 1 and 2 moves to between atoms 2 and 3, forming an imine (C=N).\n    *   The double bond between atoms 5 and 6 moves to between atoms 4 and 5 (C1 and C6).\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the product:**\n    *   The original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton is composed of two fused rings: a six-membered ring and a five-membered ring. The rearrangement breaks open this bicyclic system.\n    *   A new, larger ring is formed. Let's trace the atoms in the new ring system starting from the newly formed C-C bond:\n        *   The new bond connects the terminal vinyl carbon (was atom 1) to C5 (was atom 6).\n        *   Following the chain, we have a six-membered ring: -C5-C4-C3-N2=C(vinyl_alpha)-C(vinyl_beta)-.\n        *   The original bridge (C7) and the C1-C6 fragment form a new five-membered ring fused to the six-membered ring. The fusion occurs at the C4-C5 bond.\n        *   The resulting fused bicyclic structure is a tetrahydro-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.\n\n4.  **Determine the exact isomer:**\n    *   Let's number the resulting cyclopenta[c]pyridine skeleton to identify the positions of the double bond and the hydrogen atoms. The standard numbering for cyclopenta[c]pyridine places the nitrogen at position 2 and the fusion carbons at 4a and 7a.\n    *   Mapping our product to this system:\n        *   The new double bond is an imine (C=N), located between the original vinyl C-alpha and N2. In the final product, this corresponds to the C1=N2 bond of the pyridine ring.\n        *   The other new double bond is between C1 and C6 of the original reactant. This becomes the C7=C7a bond in the fused product.\n        *   The original C4 and C5 carbons become saturated bridgehead carbons in the product, corresponding to C4a and C5.\n        *   The original C3 and C7 carbons are also saturated.\n    *   Tracing the hydrogens, the product is **4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine**. The \"3H\" indicates that the C3 carbon, which is part of the pyridine ring but not involved in a double bond, bears a hydrogen atom. The other specified positions (4, 4a, 5, 7a) are saturated centers.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
