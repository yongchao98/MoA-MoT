    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to establish the mass dimensions of all the fields and operators in the given Lagrangian interaction term:\n\n`\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}`\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S = ∫d⁴x L` is dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of -4, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of +4.\n\nNow, let's determine the mass dimension of each component in the interaction Lagrangian:\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Lagrangian is `\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing that the derivative `∂μ` has a mass dimension of 1, the fermion field `ψ` (and `\\bar{\\psi}`) must have a mass dimension of 3/2.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `-(1/4)F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, `F^{\\mu\\nu}` must have a mass dimension of 2.\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ<sub>μν</sub>):** The term `\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]` is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, `σ_{μν}` is also dimensionless.\n\nWith these dimensions, we can find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ. The total dimension of the interaction Lagrangian must be 4:\n\n`[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]`\n`4 = [\\kappa] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2`\n`4 = [\\kappa] + 3 + 2`\n`4 = [\\kappa] + 5`\n`[\\kappa] = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\nNext, we determine the renormalizability of the theory. A key criterion for a theory to be renormalizable is that all of its coupling constants must have a non-negative mass dimension. Theories with coupling constants that have a negative mass dimension are considered non-renormalizable. This is because, in perturbation theory, a negative mass dimension for a coupling constant leads to the proliferation of divergences at higher orders, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to cancel them, which ultimately strips the theory of its predictive power.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
