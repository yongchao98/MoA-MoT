    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group, which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1680-1769 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group and an alkene (C=C) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the 1H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group. These peaks typically appear in the 4.6-5.9 ppm range.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** This data corroborates the FTIR evidence for a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. It corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 (C) + 2\\*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45). This fragment is a common and indicative cleavage product for carboxylic acids.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Integrating the Data and Determining the Formula**\n\n*   From the combined spectral data, we have confidently identified two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n*   We are left with two possibilities: B (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).\n*   To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (ignoring heteroatoms for this simple case).\n    *   For **C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   For **C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n*   Our identified functional groups account for a specific number of unsaturation degrees:\n    *   One C=O double bond (in the carboxylic acid) = 1 DoU\n    *   One C=C double bond (the alkene) = 1 DoU\n    *   Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = **2**\n*   The chemical formula **C6H10O2** has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the functional groups identified from the spectra. The formula C6H12O2 only has one degree of unsaturation, which would not account for the presence of both a carbonyl group and a C=C double bond.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound must have the chemical formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
