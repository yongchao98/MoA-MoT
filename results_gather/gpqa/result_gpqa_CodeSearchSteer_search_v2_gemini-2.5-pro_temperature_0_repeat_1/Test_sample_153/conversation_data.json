    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectral Data\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156**. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n    *   There is a significant peak at **m/z = 158** with an intensity of about 32% relative to the molecular ion peak. This M+2 peak ratio (approximately 3:1) is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom.\n    *   All the proposed options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very **broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the unknown is a carboxylic acid, effectively ruling out phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) and 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde/phenol). This narrows the possibilities to 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A singlet at **11.0 ppm** integrating to one proton (1H) is observed. A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region shows two doublets: one at **8.02 ppm** (2H) and another at **7.72 ppm** (2H). This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a *para* (1,4) substitution on a benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options:\n        *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It would display a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, with four distinct signals for the four different aromatic protons.\n        *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted. It has a plane of symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent protons on the benzene ring, which would appear as two doublets. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The mass spectrum confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR spectrum identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the carboxylic acid and establishes the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<D>>>"
