    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be inactivated. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that results in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation on the protein sequence.\n\nThe genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides called codons, with each codon specifying a particular amino acid or a stop signal. The original gene sequence begins with `ATG`, which codes for the amino acid Methionine and signals the start of protein synthesis.\n\n*   **Intact gene sequence and protein:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so the first change is a silent mutation.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a missense mutation, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it does not guarantee its inactivation.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation (both code for Phe).\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a nonsense mutation. It signals the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein will be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional, thus eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`, and `ACT` becomes `GTC`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   These are both missense mutations. While two amino acid changes are more likely to affect protein function than one, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   DNA: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`, and `GGT` becomes `ACT`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `GGT` (Glycine) changes to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   Like Mutant 3, this contains two missense mutations, which do not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate the function of the gene is to introduce a premature stop codon, which truncates the protein. Mutant 2 is the only mutant that contains a nonsense mutation (`TAA`), which will halt protein production very early. This makes it the most likely candidate to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
