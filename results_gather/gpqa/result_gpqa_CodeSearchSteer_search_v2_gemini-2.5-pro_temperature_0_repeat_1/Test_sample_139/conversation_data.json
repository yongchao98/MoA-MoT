    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W is described as a molecule where the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons. Among common gases produced in chemical reactions, diatomic deuterium (D₂ or ²H₂) fits this description perfectly. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This strongly implies that Substance X is a deuterated compound. For lighter elements, the number of neutrons often equals the number of protons in the most common isotope.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. In Celsius, this is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is a very close match, indicating that B is heavy water.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction Type**: The fact that a precipitate G, when heated, releases heavy water (B) suggests that G is a deuterated hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to an oxide and heavy water (e.g., 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O). The release of D₂ gas and the formation of a metal hydroxide precipitate points to a reaction between a metal deuteride and heavy water (Y).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X**: We are looking for a deuterated reagent common in organic chemistry, whose non-deuterated analog is also widely used. The reaction with a keto acid resulting in a product with two oxygen atoms signifies a reduction reaction. Keto acids possess both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group (3 oxygens total), and their full reduction yields a diol (2 oxygens). The most common and powerful hydride reducing agents are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n5.  **Distinguish between LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄**: The prompt states that Substance X \"reacts violently\" with liquid Y. Lithium aluminum hydride is known to react much more violently and aggressively with water compared to sodium borohydride. This makes LiAlD₄ the most probable identity for Substance X. The reaction would be LiAlD₄ reacting with heavy water (Y = D₂O) to produce D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**:\n    *   Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   To calculate the mass, we use the mass number (total protons and neutrons) of the most common or relevant isotopes:\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (⁷Li): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminum (²⁷Al): Mass number = 27\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (D) with a mass of 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al) with a mass of 27.\n    *   The problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all isotopes present.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (D): There are 4 deuterium atoms, so 4 * 2 = 8.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Al): There is 1 aluminum atom, so 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The sum of these cumulative masses is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
