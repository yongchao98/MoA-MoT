    "A) **Correct.** A 2021 study published in an ACS journal states, \"The SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 PFSEs adopt only two conformations under tension, consistent with other pseudoknots that induce comparable rates of frameshifting.\" While the term \"linearly correlated\" might be an oversimplification, the core of the statement regarding the number of conformations under tension for both viruses and its relation to frameshifting rates is supported by published research.\n\nB) **Correct.** Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8. This activation occurs without altering the expression levels of Bcl-2, which is a key protein in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. The activation of caspase-8 is a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, supporting the conclusion that ORF3a triggers apoptosis through this mechanism.\n\nC) **Correct.** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial mechanism for SARS-CoV-2, allowing the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, from the 5' end of the viral genome. This process is directed by a \"slippery sequence\" of nucleotides and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure, which cause the ribosome to shift its reading frame backward by one nucleotide. The structure of the frameshifting pseudoknot is highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, with nearly identical topology.\n\nD) **Incorrect.** The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex does function as a heterodimer with 3'-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, which is crucial for proofreading and mismatch repair during viral RNA synthesis. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds with nsp10 to form the active exonuclease complex. However, the function of this complex is to excise or degrade mismatched nucleotides from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), not to prevent its breakdown. By removing incorrect nucleotides, the complex actively breaks down a portion of the RNA strand to ensure the fidelity of the final genome. Therefore, the statement that it \"prevents the breakdown of dsRNA\" is a misrepresentation of its enzymatic function.\n\n<<<D>>>"
