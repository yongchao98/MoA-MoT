    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. When the starting alkene is *trans* (E), this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of the two possible enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a *trans*-epoxide (a racemic mixture) results in the formation of a single meso diol. In this case, the product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis* (Z) alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide. This epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *anti*-addition of water to this meso epoxide results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric diols. The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC. The meso diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, appearing as a separate peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. Consequently, the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will elute as its own distinct peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
