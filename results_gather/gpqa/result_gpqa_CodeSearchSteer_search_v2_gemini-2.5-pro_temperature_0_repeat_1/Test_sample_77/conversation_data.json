    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and correctly describe the electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion by accounting for the finite speed of light, an effect known as retardation.\n\nThe potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time *t* is determined by the state of the charge *q* at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*. This is the instant when the electromagnetic field must have been generated to reach the observer at time *t* after propagating at the speed of light *c*.\n\nThe correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, using the notation provided in the question, are:\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o [d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c]}$\n\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by *c*:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi [d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c]}$\n\nSimilarly, this can be rewritten as:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions show that the potentials depend on the velocity of the charge and its position at the retarded time. The denominator term, $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, accounts for the fact that the distance the field has to travel is affected by the movement of the charge itself.\n\nComparing these correct forms with the given options, option D matches these expressions.\n\nFurthermore, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. We can verify this for option D:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\nUsing the relationship $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$, we can substitute $\\epsilon_o c = 1/(\\mu_o c)$:\n$\\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi [1/(\\mu_o c)] (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$\nThis confirms the consistency of the expressions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
