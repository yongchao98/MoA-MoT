    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of a specific stereodescriptor such as (R) or (S) in a compound's name indicates a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule, which will be optically active.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes specific stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). This indicates that a single, specific enantiomer is being described. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Molecules that have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The (2R,3R) configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. As a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" in the name specifies a particular enantiomer of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This indicates the molecule is chiral and this specific form is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This ketone does not contain any chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the cyclopentyl ring and the butyl chain are not bonded to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
