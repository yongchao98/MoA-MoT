    "The provided spectroscopic data allows for a detailed structural determination of the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically an ester, which typically absorbs in the 1750-1700 cm⁻¹ region.\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal, a triplet integrating to three protons, suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadripole coupling with the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet, integrating to two protons, points to a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂-). This signal, along with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ethyl ester).\n\n### Structure Elucidation:\n\nCombining these pieces of information:\n1.  The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n2.  The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH₂).\n3.  The IR and NMR data confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  The NMR data shows a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the provided data. The common name for this compound is Benzocaine. Spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate found in literature confirms these assignments.\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a propionyl group, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is a secondary amide, which does not match the IR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is a primary amide and has a 1,3 (meta) substitution pattern, which does not match the NMR aromatic signals.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Perfectly matches all spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
