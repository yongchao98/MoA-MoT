    "The provided information from the characterization techniques allows for the identification of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group present in all four possible compounds.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The absence of signals for vinyl hydrogens confirms that the molecule is saturated, which is consistent with all four options. The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns.\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one hydrogen (giving a doublet), two hydrogens (giving a triplet), and three hydrogens (giving a quartet).\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one hydrogen (giving a doublet), two hydrogens (giving a triplet), and another set of two hydrogens (giving another triplet).\n\n### Evaluation of Potential Compounds\n\nThe next step is to analyze the structure of each potential compound to determine which one would produce the observed ¹H NMR splitting patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    Let's analyze the protons on the main chain of the structure `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`.\n    *   The proton at position **(b)** is adjacent to the three protons of the methyl group (a), the single proton at position (c), and the two protons of the attached ethyl group's CH₂. This environment, with neighbors of 3H, 1H, and 2H, would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   The proton at position **(c)** is adjacent to the single proton at position (b), the two protons of the attached ethyl group's CH₂, and the two protons of the CH₂ group at position (d). This environment, with neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H, would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    This structure is the only one that perfectly matches both of the complex splitting patterns described in the problem.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    In this structure, `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`, one methine proton is coupled to a CH₂, a CH₃, and another CH, which would give a dtq. However, the second methine proton is only coupled to one CH and one CH₃, which would result in a doublet of quartets (dq), not a dtt.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:**\n    For the structure `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`, one methine proton is coupled to the six protons of the isopropyl group and one other methine proton, leading to a complex multiplet (a septet of doublets). The other methine proton is coupled to a CH, a CH₃, and a CH₂, which would give a dqt. Neither of these patterns matches the dtt signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:**\n    In the structure `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`, one methine proton is coupled to a CH₂, another CH, and a CH₂ from an ethyl group, which would produce a dtt. However, the other methine proton is only coupled to one CH and a CH₂ from an ethyl group, resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt), not a dtq.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the splitting patterns, compound A is the only structure consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
