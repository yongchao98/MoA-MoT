    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to consider the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their directing properties:\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. This category includes activating groups and halogens.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (Toluene):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** Activating, ortho/para-directing.\n    *   3) **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating, but ortho/para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   6) **-COOH (Benzoic acid):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while substances with ortho/para-directing groups will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order will begin with the meta-directing compounds and end with the ortho/para-directing compounds.\n\n### Analysis of Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest para-isomer yield)\n\nFor nitrobenzene (-NO2), benzoic acid (-COOH), and ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5), the substitution occurs predominantly at the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is very small.\n\n*   **4) Nitrobenzene (-NO2):** The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination requires harsh conditions, and the substitution is strongly directed to the meta position. The para-isomer yield is extremely low.\n*   **2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5):** The ester group is also strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Data for the nitration of a benzoic ester shows a para-isomer yield of 5%. The yield for bromination is expected to be similarly low.\n*   **6) Benzoic acid (-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivating and meta-directing group. Its deactivating strength is comparable to the ester group.\n\nAmong these three, the -NO2 group is the most strongly deactivating, leading to the lowest proportion of ortho/para products. The -COOC2H5 and -COOH groups are also strongly deactivating. Comparing the nitration data for a benzoic ester (5% para) and the general understanding of the powerful meta-directing effect of the nitro group, we can establish the beginning of the sequence. The deactivating strength generally follows -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOR. A stronger deactivating effect correlates with a lower proportion of the already disfavored para product. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Nitrobenzene < Benzoic Acid < Ethyl Benzoate.\n\nSo, the beginning of the order is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Analysis of Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (Highest para-isomer yield)\n\nFor toluene (-CH3), ethylbenzene (-C2H5), and chlorobenzene (-Cl), we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by both electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Steric Effects:** The para position is less sterically hindered than the two ortho positions. As the size of the substituent group increases, access to the ortho positions becomes more difficult for the incoming electrophile, thus increasing the proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** All three groups (-CH3, -C2H5, -Cl) have lone pairs or electron-donating ability that stabilizes the intermediate carbocation (arenium ion) for ortho and para attack.\n\nLet's compare the substituents:\n*   **1) Toluene (-CH3) vs. 5) Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** Both are alkyl groups that activate the ring. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions for ethylbenzene leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. Therefore, the para yield for toluene is less than for ethylbenzene (1 < 5).\n*   **3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens are deactivating overall due to their strong inductive electron withdrawal, but they are ortho/para-directing because of resonance stabilization from their lone pairs. In halogenated benzenes, the para-isomer is often strongly favored. For example, the nitration of chlorobenzene yields 70% of the para-isomer. This high preference for the para position is a known characteristic for halogens.\n\nComparing the alkyl groups to chlorine:\n*   Bromination of toluene gives a mixture of ortho and para products.\n*   The ethyl group's bulkiness increases the para-product yield relative to toluene.\n*   The chloro group in chlorobenzene strongly favors the para position, often more so than small alkyl groups.\n\nBased on typical isomer distributions, the steric hindrance of the ethyl group increases the para yield over the methyl group. The electronic and steric properties of the chloro substituent lead to a very high percentage of para substitution. Comparing typical yields, the order of increasing para-isomer fraction is generally Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n\nSo, the end of the order is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Arrangement\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
