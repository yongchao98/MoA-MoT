    "To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we use the relative entropy measure, which is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of a reference Gaussian state (τ) and the von Neumann entropy of the non-Gaussian state in question (ρ).\n\nThe formula is given by:\n`del_b = S(τ) - S(ρ)`\n\nHere, `ρ` is the density matrix of the Schrödinger cat state `|psi>`, and `τ` is the density matrix of a Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as `ρ`.\n\nThe state is defined as:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n\nFor the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state becomes an odd cat state.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the von Neumann Entropy of the state ρ**\n\nThe state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The density matrix for a pure state is `ρ = |psi><psi|`. The von Neumann entropy `S(ρ) = -trace(ρ * ln(ρ))` for any pure state is zero. This is because for a pure state, one eigenvalue of the density matrix is 1, and all others are 0, leading to `S(ρ) = -(1*ln(1) + 0*ln(0) + ...) = 0`.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity simplifies to `del_b = S(τ)`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reference Gaussian state τ**\n\nThe reference Gaussian state `τ` is defined by its first and second moments, which must match those of `ρ`.\n\n*   **First moment (mean amplitude):** For the odd cat state with `phi = -pi/4`, the mean amplitude `<a> = <psi|a|psi>` is zero. This means the reference Gaussian state is centered at the origin in phase space.\n*   **Second moments:** We need to calculate `<a^2>` and `<a_dag a>`. For an odd cat state, these are given by:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    *   `<a_dag a> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n\nFor `alpha = 0.5`:\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n*   `<a_dag a> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the von Neumann Entropy of the reference state τ**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `v`. The symplectic eigenvalue is calculated from the covariance matrix, which in turn depends on the second moments `<a_dag a>` (denoted as `N_s`) and `<a^2>` (denoted as `M_s`).\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `v` is given by:\n`v = sqrt((N_s + 1/2)^2 - |M_s|^2)`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   `N_s = 1.02075`\n*   `M_s = 0.25`\n*   `v = sqrt((1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25^2) = sqrt(1.52075^2 - 0.0625)`\n*   `v = sqrt(2.31268 - 0.0625) = sqrt(2.25018) ≈ 1.5`\n\nThe von Neumann entropy `S(τ)` is then calculated using the formula:\n`S(τ) = (v + 1/2) * ln(v + 1/2) - (v - 1/2) * ln(v - 1/2)`\n\nSubstituting `v = 1.5`:\n*   `S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n*   `S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   `S(τ) = 2 * 0.6931 - 0 = 1.3862`\n\nThe calculated amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.25\nB) 2.48\nC) 0\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
