    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and an evaluation of each statement:\n\n*   **Step 1: Compound A (C3H6) to Compound B** Compound A (C3H6) is propene. It undergoes bromination in carbon tetrachloride to yield 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Compound B to Compound C** Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a dehydrohalogenation reaction to form propyne (Compound C).\n\n*   **Step 3: Compound C to Compound D** When propyne (Compound C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes cyclic polymerization (trimerization) to produce 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene (Compound D).\n\n*   **Step 4: Compound D to Compound E** Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a nitrating mixture (concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid) to form 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene (Compound E).\n\n*   **Step 5: Compound E to Compound F** Compound E (2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene) is reduced using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to yield 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, also known as mesidine (Compound F).\n\n*   **Step 6: Compound F to Compound G** Compound F (2,4,6-trimethylaniline) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) in a diazotization reaction to form the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt (Compound G).\n\n*   **Step 7: Compound G to Compound H** Compound G (2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (upon warming with water) to produce 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Compound H).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne. Propyne is a colorless, highly flammable gas. This statement is correct.\n\n**B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is used to detect the presence of phenols, which typically form a complex with ferric ions, resulting in a red, blue, green, or purple coloration. A yellow color is not the characteristic result for a positive phenol test; in fact, ferric chloride solution itself is yellowish-brown. Therefore, this statement is likely incorrect as it does not describe the typical positive result for a phenol.\n\n**C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine). Aromatic amines like this are widely used as precursors in the manufacturing of dyes and pigments. This statement is correct.\n\n**D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and produce a single peak. Similarly, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also equivalent and give another single peak. Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of mesitylene shows two singlets. This statement is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the incorrect statement is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
