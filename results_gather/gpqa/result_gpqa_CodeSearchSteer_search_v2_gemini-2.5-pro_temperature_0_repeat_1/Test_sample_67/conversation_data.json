    "The problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" eigenstate with respect to the z-axis.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around this new axis. The Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of the system, becomes dependent on the interaction with the new magnetic field along the Y-axis (`H = -γ * B * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component).\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value (or average) of any spin component can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation. For the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, its rate of change is determined by the commutator of the Hamiltonian with the `Sz` operator. This leads to a set of coupled differential equations for the expectation values of the spin components.\n\nSolving these equations reveals that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and therefore the z-component of the magnetic moment `<μz(t)>`, oscillates. This oscillation is described by a cosine function:\n\n`<μz(t)> = (<μz(0)>) * cos(ωt)`\n\nThe angular frequency of this oscillation, `ω`, is known as the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field (B) and the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) of the particle. The formula for the Larmor frequency is:\n\n`ω = γ * B`\n\nThis frequency represents how fast the spin precesses around the new magnetic field direction. The expectation values of the spin components perpendicular to the magnetic field will oscillate at this frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
