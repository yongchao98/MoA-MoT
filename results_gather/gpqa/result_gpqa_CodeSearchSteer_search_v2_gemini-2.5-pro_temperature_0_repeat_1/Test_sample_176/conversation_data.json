    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law for luminosity.**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where:\n    *   R is the star's radius.\n    *   T is the star's effective surface temperature.\n    *   σ (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   π (pi) is a mathematical constant.\n\n2.  **Set up a ratio of luminosities.**\n    We want to find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) is greater than that of Star_2 (L₂). This is the ratio L₁ / L₂.\n    L₁ = 4πR₁²σT₁⁴\n    L₂ = 4πR₂²σT₂⁴\n\n    Dividing the first equation by the second gives:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Use the given information to find the ratio of the radii.**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n\n4.  **Use the given information to find the ratio of the temperatures.**\n    The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their peak emission wavelengths, λ_max) are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:\n    λ_max = b / T\n    where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n\n    Since λ_max₁ = λ_max₂, we have:\n    b / T₁ = b / T₂\n    This implies that the temperatures of the two stars are equal:\n    T₁ = T₂\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1\n\n5.  **Calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\n    Now, substitute the ratios for the radii and temperatures back into the simplified luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe information about the stars' masses and radial velocities is not needed for this calculation, as the luminosity can be determined directly from the radius and temperature using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<B>>>"
