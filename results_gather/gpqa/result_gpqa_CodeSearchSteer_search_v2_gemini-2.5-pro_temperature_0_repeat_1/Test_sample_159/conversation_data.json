    "An N-sided polygonal aperture with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circular aperture of radius 'a' as N becomes infinitely large. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field region is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (dark rings) in this diffraction pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the minima is given by:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (m * λ) / (π * D)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture (which is 2a in this case).\n*   m represents the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe first minimum corresponds to the first zero of J₁(x), which is approximately 3.8317. The angular position is:\n\nθ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (π * 2a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a\n\nThe second minimum corresponds to the second zero of J₁(x), which is approximately 7.0156. The angular position is:\n\nθ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (π * 2a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between these two angles:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.117 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.507 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\nBased on the calculations, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<D>>>"
