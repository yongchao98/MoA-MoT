    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (λ)**: The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of the target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), which is the effective area for a collision to occur. The general formula is λ = 1/(nσ).\n\n2.  **Analyzing λ1 (Gas Molecule-Gas Molecule Collisions)**:\n    *   **Collision Participants**: A gas molecule collides with other gas molecules.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ1)**: When two identical spherical molecules of diameter 'd' collide, the effective area for a collision is determined by a circle of radius 'd' (or diameter '2d'). Therefore, the collision cross-section is σ1 = πd².\n    *   **Relative Motion**: Since the target gas molecules are also in random thermal motion, a correction factor of √2 is introduced to account for the average relative velocity.\n    *   **Formula for λ1**: Combining these factors, the mean free path for a gas molecule is λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²).\n\n3.  **Analyzing λ2 (Electron-Gas Molecule Collisions)**:\n    *   **Collision Participants**: An electron from the beam collides with a gas molecule.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (σ2)**: The electron is a point-like particle, meaning its physical size is negligible compared to the gas molecule's diameter 'd'. The collision, therefore, occurs if the electron comes within the radius (d/2) of the molecule's center. The effective area for this collision is σ2 = π(d/2)² = πd²/4.\n    *   **Relative Motion**: The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them extremely high velocities, far exceeding the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Consequently, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets, and the √2 correction factor is not needed.\n    *   **Formula for λ2**: The mean free path for an electron is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2) = 1 / (n * πd²/4).\n\n4.  **Comparing λ2 and λ1**:\n    *   We have the two equations:\n        *   λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n        *   λ2 = 4 / (n * πd²)\n    *   To find the relationship, we can take the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n        *   λ2 / λ1 = [4 / (n * πd²)] / [1 / (√2 * n * πd²)]\n        *   λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n    *   Calculating the value: 4 * √2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is approximately 5.66 times larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). This is because the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule is significantly smaller than that for two molecules hitting each other. A smaller collision cross-section means a lower probability of collision, resulting in a longer average distance traveled between collisions.\n\nComparing our result (λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1) with the given options:\n*   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect.\n*   C) λ2 < λ1 - Incorrect.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - **Correct**, as 5.66 is greater than or equal to 1.22.\n\n<<<D>>>"
