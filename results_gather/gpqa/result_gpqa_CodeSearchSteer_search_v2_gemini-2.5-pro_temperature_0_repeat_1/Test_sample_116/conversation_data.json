    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. This property is typically observed in molecules that are chiral. Let's analyze each of the given compounds:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can result in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, thus making it chiral and optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center, which makes the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure of benzophenone features a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain a chiral center. In solution, the phenyl rings can rotate freely, and the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive. While it can form chiral crystals, the individual molecule itself is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid. It is a planar molecule and has a center of symmetry, which precludes chirality. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer (a type of diastereomer) of dimethyl maleate.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
