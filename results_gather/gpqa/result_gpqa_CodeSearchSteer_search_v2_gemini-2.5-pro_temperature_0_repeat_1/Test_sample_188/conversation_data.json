    "A) **Magnon:** Magnons, or their quanta, are spin waves that propagate in a magnetically ordered material. Their existence is a direct consequence of the spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational symmetry. In a ferromagnet, all spins align in a particular direction in the ground state, thus breaking the rotational symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian. The low-energy excitations from this ground state are magnons, which are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of this broken symmetry.\n\nC) **Phonon:** Phonons are quantized modes of vibration that occur in a rigid crystal lattice. The formation of a crystal spontaneously breaks the continuous translational and rotational symmetry of free space, as the atoms are fixed in a periodic array. Phonons are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons that arise from this spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry.\n\nD) **Pion:** Pions are subatomic particles that are understood in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of the strong interaction. This symmetry is not exact due to the small masses of the quarks, which is why pions have a small but non-zero mass, rather than being truly massless.\n\nB) **Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like soliton in a nonlinear field theory. In magnetic materials, skyrmions are localized, swirling magnetic textures. Their stability is due to their topological properties, and their existence is often enabled by the breaking of inversion symmetry, which is a discrete symmetry. While skyrmions are a result of symmetry breaking, they are not the Nambu-Goldstone bosons themselves. Goldstone's theorem applies to the breaking of *continuous* symmetries and predicts the existence of massless (or light) bosons (like magnons, phonons, and pions), whereas skyrmions are massive, localized configurations. Although a crystal made of skyrmions can have its own Goldstone modes corresponding to the breaking of translational symmetry, the individual skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not directly a Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
