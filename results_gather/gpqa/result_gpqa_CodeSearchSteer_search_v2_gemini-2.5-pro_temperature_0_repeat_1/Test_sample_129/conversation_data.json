    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds absorbing Lyman-alpha radiation so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we must consider the wavelength ranges involved.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nEarth's atmosphere blocks most UV radiation, making it impossible for ground-based telescopes to directly observe the Lyα line at its rest wavelength. The atmospheric optical window, the range of wavelengths that can penetrate the atmosphere and reach the ground, begins at approximately 3800 Å to 4000 Å. For a ground-based optical telescope to detect the absorption feature, the Lyα line must be redshifted from its original 1216 Å to a wavelength greater than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\nThe relationship between redshift (z), the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted), and the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given by the formula:\nz = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the lower limit of the optical window, approximately 4000 Å.\n\nz = (4000 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 3.29 - 1\nz ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculation indicates that a redshift of at least ~2.3 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the visible part of the spectrum.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A redshift of 1.2 would shift the line to 1216 * (1 + 1.2) = 2675 Å (still in the UV).\n*   A redshift of 1.9 would shift the line to 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526 Å (still in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere).\n*   A redshift of 2.4 would shift the line to 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134 Å. This wavelength is within the range detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n*   A redshift of 3 would shift the line to 1216 * (1 + 3) = 4864 Å, which is also detectable.\n\nBased on the calculation, a redshift of 1.9 is insufficient. The lowest value among the options that ensures the Lyman-alpha absorption is shifted into the optical window is 2.4. This is consistent with astronomical observations, which generally require a redshift of z > 2 for ground-based Lyman-alpha studies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
