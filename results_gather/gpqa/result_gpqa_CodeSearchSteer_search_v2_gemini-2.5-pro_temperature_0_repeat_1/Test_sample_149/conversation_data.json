    "The final product is identified by following a three-step reaction sequence starting from a compound identified by its molecular formula and NMR data.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the 1H-NMR data is as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is coupled to a neighboring methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons suggests a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material undergoes a series of three reactions:\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). This reaction forms 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). In the presence of a strong base like potassium hydroxide (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-aldol condensation. In this reaction, two molecules of the aldehyde react. One forms an enolate which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the second molecule. The \"Heat\" condition promotes a subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe self-aldol condensation of two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde results in the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
