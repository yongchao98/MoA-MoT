    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the properties of double-lined spectroscopic binary systems. For such systems, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = M₁ + M₂) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\nThe relationship is derived from Kepler's third law and is given by the formula:\nM_total = (P / (2πG * sin³(i))) * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nSince both systems are described as having eclipses, we can assume their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°, and therefore sin(i) is approximately 1.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total,1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total,2).\n\nM_total,1 / M_total,2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ / (2πG * sin³(i₁))] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ / (2πG * sin³(i₂))]\n\nAssuming sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂) ≈ 1 and noting that the constant term `2πG` cancels out, the ratio simplifies to:\n\nM_total,1 / M_total,2 = (P₁ / P₂) * [(K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) / (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)]³\n\nNow, let's plug in the values for each system.\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nM_total,1 / M_total,2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nM_total,1 / M_total,2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM_total,1 / M_total,2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total,1 / M_total,2 = 54 / 125\nM_total,1 / M_total,2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
