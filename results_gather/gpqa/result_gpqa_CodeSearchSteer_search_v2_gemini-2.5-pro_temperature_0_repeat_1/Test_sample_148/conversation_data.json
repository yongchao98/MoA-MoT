    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n**1. Analysis of the Â¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton. They have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H.\n*   **Interpretation:** The presence of two peaks for what should be a single proton indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since the integrals are roughly equal, the two species are present in a nearly 1:1 ratio. The fact that spin-spin coupling has been ruled out means the splitting is not due to neighboring protons.\n\n**2. Analysis of the LC-MS Data**\n\n*   **Observation:** The Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis shows two separate peaks in the chromatogram. Both peaks have identical mass spectra, which match the expected molecular weight of the synthesized peptide.\n*   **Interpretation:** The LC separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity). Two peaks mean there are two different compounds that can be separated under the given conditions. The identical mass spectra confirm that these two compounds are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and mass) and not an impurity with a different molecular weight, like a precursor. The elevated temperature in the LC method likely enhances the separation of these isomers, which might co-elute or show broad peaks at lower temperatures due to interconversion.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are mirror-image stereoisomers. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single peak in both the NMR and the LC. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would result in a side product with a higher molecular weight than the expected peptide. The MS data shows both peaks have the same, expected mass, which rules out this possibility.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **In NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers give different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in a pair of diastereomers will have different chemical shifts. This perfectly explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **In LC-MS:** Due to their different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This explains the two LC peaks. Since they are isomers, they would have the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **atropisomerism**, which is caused by hindered rotation around a single bond, such as the C-N amide bond, especially when proline or other N-substituted amino acids are involved. This restricted rotation can create stable, separable isomers that fit all the observations.\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor molecule from the synthesis would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different molecular weight. This is contradicted by the LC-MS data, which shows both separated compounds have the same mass as the target molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from NMR and LC-MS strongly supports the conclusion that the sample is a mixture of two diastereomers. They are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR in a standard achiral environment, and they have the same molecular mass.\n\n<<<C>>>"
