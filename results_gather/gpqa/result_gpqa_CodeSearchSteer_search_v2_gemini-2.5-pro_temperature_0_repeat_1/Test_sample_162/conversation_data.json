    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the final pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = Atomic Mass of Fe + 3 * (Atomic Mass of O + Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.845 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**2. Determine the required volume of strong acid**\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ by a monobasic strong acid (represented by H⁺) proceeds according to the following reaction:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ to dissolve completely.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ needed = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\nThe acid solution has a concentration of 0.1 M (or 0.1 mol/L). The volume needed is:\n\n*   Volume of acid (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n*   Volume of acid (L) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n\nConverting this volume to cubic centimeters (cm³):\n\n*   Volume of acid (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution**\n\nAfter dissolution, the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ forms 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ moles of Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n*   Concentration of Fe³⁺ = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M.\n\nThe Fe³⁺ ion hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak acid and producing H⁺ ions, which lowers the pH. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\nThe acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction at 25°C is approximately 6 x 10⁻³.\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium expression to find the concentration of H₃O⁺ (or H⁺):\n\nKa = [H⁺][Fe(OH)²⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n\nAssuming the initial concentration of H⁺ and Fe(OH)²⁺ is zero and letting 'x' be the change in concentration at equilibrium:\n\n6 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\n\nSince the Ka value is relatively large, we solve the full quadratic equation:\n\nx² = (6 x 10⁻³)(9.357 x 10⁻³ - x)\nx² = 5.6142 x 10⁻⁵ - 6 x 10⁻³x\nx² + 0.006x - 5.6142 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n\nx = [-0.006 ± √(0.006² - 4(1)(-5.6142 x 10⁻⁵))] / 2\nx = [-0.006 ± √(3.6 x 10⁻⁵ + 2.24568 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.006 ± √(2.60568 x 10⁻⁴)] / 2\nx = [-0.006 ± 0.01614] / 2\n\nSince concentration cannot be negative, we take the positive root:\n\nx = (0.01014) / 2 = 0.00507 M.\n\nSo, the equilibrium concentration of H⁺ is 0.00507 M.\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH:\n\n*   pH = -log[H⁺]\n*   pH = -log(0.00507) ≈ 2.29\n\nBased on the calculations, the required volume of acid is approximately 28.07 cm³ and the resulting pH is approximately 2.29. Comparing these values to the given options, option B is the closest match. The slight discrepancy in pH could be due to the use of a slightly different Ka value for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺.\n\n<<<B>>>"
