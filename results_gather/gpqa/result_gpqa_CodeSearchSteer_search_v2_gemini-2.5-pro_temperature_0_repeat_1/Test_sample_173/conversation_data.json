    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Initial and Final State Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV.\n    *   Its initial momentum is p_initial = 0.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   Let m₁ be the more massive fragment and m₂ be the less massive one.\n    *   We are given that m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses in terms of M:\n*   Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum equation: 2 * m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M, which gives 3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n*   Therefore, m₂ = 0.33 * M.\n*   And m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 0.66 * M.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁): E_rest₁ = m₁ * c² = 0.66 * (M * c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂): E_rest₂ = m₂ * c² = 0.33 * (M * c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = E_initial - (E_rest₁ + E_rest₂)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T_total = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation of T₁**\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n*   p₁ = p₂\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), rest-mass energy (E_rest), and momentum (p) is E² = (p*c)² + (E_rest)². The kinetic energy T is given by E = T + E_rest.\n*   Therefore, (p*c)² = (T + E_rest)² - E_rest² = T² + 2 * T * E_rest.\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²:\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * E_rest₁ = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * E_rest₂\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n*   T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)\n*   T₁² + 396 * T₁ = (9 - 6 * T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198 * T₁)\n*   T₁² + 396 * T₁ = T₁² - 204 * T₁ + 603\n*   396 * T₁ = -204 * T₁ + 603\n*   600 * T₁ = 603\n*   T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**5. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁**\n\nIn the classical approximation, kinetic energy is T_classical = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we can establish a ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n*   T₁_classical / T₂_classical = [p₁² / (2m₁)] / [p₂² / (2m₂)] = m₂ / m₁\n*   Since m₁ = 2 * m₂, the ratio is T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2, which means T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still the Q-value:\n*   T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\n*   T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n*   T₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n**6. Finding the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, we convert this difference to MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
