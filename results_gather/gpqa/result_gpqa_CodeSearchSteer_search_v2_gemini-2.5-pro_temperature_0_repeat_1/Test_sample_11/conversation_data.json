    "To solve this problem, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (π⁺) is initially at rest, so the initial momentum is zero, and the initial energy is its rest mass energy.\n\n**1. Initial State (Before Decay):**\n*   **Pion (π⁺) at rest:**\n    *   Initial Momentum (p_initial) = 0\n    *   Initial Energy (E_initial) = Rest mass energy of π⁺ = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\n**2. Final State (After Decay):**\n*   **Products: Muon (μ⁺) and Neutrino (ν)**\n    *   Let the momentum of the muon be p_μ and the momentum of the neutrino be p_ν.\n    *   From the **conservation of momentum**, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n        *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n    *   The total final energy (E_final) is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n        *   E_final = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   For the muon (a particle with mass): E_μ² = (p * c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   For the neutrino (assumed to be massless): E_ν = p * c. This also means the neutrino's kinetic energy (KE_ν) is equal to its total energy (E_ν).\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n\nWe can now solve for the energies of the product particles.\n\n1.  From the neutrino's energy-momentum relation, we have p * c = E_ν.\n2.  Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n    *   E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n3.  From the conservation of energy (Equation 1), rearrange to find E_μ:\n    *   E_μ = m_π * c² - E_ν\n4.  Substitute this expression for E_μ into the equation from step 2:\n    *   (m_π * c² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n5.  Expand the left side:\n    *   (m_π * c²)² - 2 * (m_π * c²) * E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n6.  The E_ν² terms cancel out. Now, solve for E_ν (the neutrino's energy):\n    *   E_ν = [(m_π * c²)² - (m_μ * c²)²] / [2 * (m_π * c²)]\n7.  Plug in the given rest mass values:\n    *   E_ν = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)\n    *   E_ν = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2\n    *   E_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n    *   E_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nSince the neutrino is considered massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy.\n*   **KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, find the total energy of the muon using the conservation of energy:\n*   E_μ = 139.6 MeV - E_ν\n*   E_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\n*   KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ * c²\n*   KE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n*   **KE_μ = 4.1 MeV**\n\nA more precise calculation yields KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV. The results match one of the given options.\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν).\n\n<<<C>>>"
