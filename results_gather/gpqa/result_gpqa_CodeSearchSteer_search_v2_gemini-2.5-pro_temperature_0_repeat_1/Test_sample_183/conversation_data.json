    "An analysis of the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, reveals a 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern on the benzene ring. Synthesizing such a structure with high yield is complex due to the directing effects of the substituents. A straightforward electrophilic substitution approach is unlikely to succeed because activating groups (like -OEt and -tBu) direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, while the desired substitution pattern requires placing a group at a meta position relative to another.\n\nThis challenge often necessitates a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups, which temporarily occupy a position to force a substitution elsewhere, and can be removed later. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an ideal blocking group because sulfonation is reversible.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed options based on a plausible synthetic route derived from established organic chemistry principles.\n\n**Plausible High-Yield Synthesis Strategy:**\n\nThe key to obtaining the 1,2,3-substitution pattern is to control the regiochemistry of the nitration steps. A logical approach involves using a sulfonic acid blocking group to create an ortho-substituted intermediate, which is otherwise a minor product.\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is alkylated with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3 to form tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** Tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but for steric reasons, the major product is the para-substituted isomer, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n3.  **First Nitration:** The blocked intermediate is nitrated. The tert-butyl group directs ortho, and the sulfonic acid group directs meta. Both effects guide the incoming nitro group to the same position: ortho to the tert-butyl group. This yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking):** The sulfonic acid group is removed by heating with dilute sulfuric acid. This step yields **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (*o*-tert-butylnitrobenzene) in high yield.\n5.  **Second Nitration:** The resulting *o*-tert-butylnitrobenzene is nitrated again. The tert-butyl group (at C1) is an o,p-director (directing to C4, C6), and the nitro group (at C2) is a m-director (directing to C4, C6). The directing effects are cooperative, leading to the formation of **1-tert-butyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene**.\n6.  **Selective Reduction:** One of the two nitro groups must be reduced to an amine. The nitro group at C4 is less sterically hindered than the one at C2 (which is next to the bulky t-butyl group). Selective reduction (e.g., using (NH₄)₂S, a common reagent for this purpose, though Fe/HCl is listed in the options) would yield **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n7.  **Diazotization:** The resulting aniline is treated with sodium nitrite and HCl to form a diazonium salt.\n8.  **Hydrolysis to Phenol:** The diazonium salt is heated in water (H₃O⁺, heat) to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Finally, the phenol is treated with a base (NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the target ether, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\nWhen we compare this logical synthesis with the provided options, we find that none of the sequences are entirely correct as written. However, we must identify the option that contains the necessary transformations.\n\n*   **Option A** lists the following reagents: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO₂/HCl; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄; vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat; viii) dilute H₂SO₄; ix) NaOH/EtBr. This option includes all the key reaction types required for the plausible synthesis outlined above: alkylation, sulfonation/desulfonation (blocking strategy), two nitrations, reduction, diazotization, conversion to phenol, and ether synthesis. Although the order presented in the option is scrambled and chemically nonsensical, it is the only option that contains the complete set of necessary reagents to achieve the target molecule via a complex, multi-step synthesis involving a blocking group. The initial three steps (alkylation, para-sulfonation, ortho-nitration) represent the correct start to a high-yield synthesis of a key intermediate.\n\n*   **Option B** proceeds via *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and ultimately leads to a 1,2,4-substituted product (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), which is the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Option C** attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is not a feasible reaction under these conditions, making the sequence incorrect from an early stage.\n\n*   **Option D** has an impossible step (diazotization without an amine) and is missing a key reduction step.\n\nTherefore, despite the incorrect ordering of the steps, Option A is the only one that represents a collection of reactions that could plausibly lead to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
