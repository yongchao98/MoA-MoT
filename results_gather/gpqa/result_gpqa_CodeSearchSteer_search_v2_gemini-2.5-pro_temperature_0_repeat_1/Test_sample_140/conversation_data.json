    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon.\n\nIn the case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine atom:\n*   **Position 6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible initial elimination pathways:\n\n**Pathway 1: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n1.  The amide anion removes the hydrogen from C6. This is kinetically favored because a C-H bond is weaker than a C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion, forming a **2-deuterobenzyne** intermediate. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at C2.\n3.  The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond:\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group attaches to C1, and the subsequent protonation (from the ammonia solvent) occurs at C6. This results in **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. When renumbered to prioritize the amino group, the deuterium atom is now at the 3-position. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n**Pathway 2: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2**\n1.  The amide anion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.\n2.  Elimination of the bromide ion results in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n3.  The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks this symmetrical intermediate at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation. Both attacks lead to the same single product: **aniline**.\n\nTherefore, the reaction yields a mixture of three possible organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
