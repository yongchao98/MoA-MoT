    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of the factor `1/(4π)` that appears in the expression for the diagram's amplitude. This factor arises from the integration over loop momenta in four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations, each loop integral over a four-dimensional momentum vector (`d⁴k`) typically introduces a factor of `1/(4π)²` after performing the integration over the angular components in Euclidean space (via Wick rotation).\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The contribution from the loop integrals will produce a factor of:\n\n`(1/(4π)²)^L = 1/(4π)^(2L)`\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nWe can identify the loop factor in this expression as `1/(4π)⁶`. By comparing this to the general formula, we can find the number of loops, `L`:\n\n`1/(4π)^(2L) = 1/(4π)⁶`\n\nEquating the exponents gives:\n\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other terms in the expression are consistent with a three-loop diagram:\n*   **`alpha³ * g²`**: This term represents the coupling constants associated with the vertices of the diagram. The powers indicate that there are a total of five vertices, three of one type (associated with coupling `alpha`) and two of another (associated with coupling `g`).\n*   **`sqrt(2) * 8`**: These are numerical factors that can arise from symmetry considerations of the diagram or from the specifics of the integration.\n*   **`(Q/M)²`**: This is a ratio of energy scales (`Q`) to mass scales (`M`), which is a typical result of evaluating loop integrals.\n\nBased on the loop factor `1/(4π)⁶`, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
