    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n**1. Analysis of Compound X's Structure using Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption band in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield due to the deshielding effect of the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, meaning these protons are ortho to the -COOH group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting these protons are ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) with adjacent protons on both sides.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton in the benzylic position (attached to the benzene ring) and adjacent to other protons.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The data points to a *sec*-butyl group attached to the benzene ring: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The proton of the CH group is the signal at 2.9 ppm, coupled to the CH₃ group (1.4 ppm) and the CH₂ group (1.7 ppm). The CH₂ group is also coupled to the terminal CH₃ group (0.9 ppm).\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined spectroscopic evidence, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Hydriodic Acid (HI):**\n\n*   The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent.\n*   This reagent is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to alkanes (in this case, a methyl group, -CH₃). For example, acetic acid is reduced to ethane. Aromatic acids can also be reduced; for instance, benzoic acid can be reduced to toluene.\n*   The alkyl group (sec-butyl) on the aromatic ring is stable and will not be affected by these reaction conditions.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product:**\n\n*   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   Reaction: Reduction of the carboxylic acid group.\n*   The -COOH group at position 1 is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n*   Final Product: The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy first elucidating the structure of the starting material as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and then considering the known reactivity of red phosphorus and HI as a strong reducing agent for carboxylic acids, the final product is identified as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
