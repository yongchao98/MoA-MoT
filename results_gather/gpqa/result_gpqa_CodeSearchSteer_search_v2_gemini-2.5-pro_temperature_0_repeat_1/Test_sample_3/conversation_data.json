    "In a hypothetical universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south magnetic poles—exist, two of the fundamental Maxwell's equations that describe electromagnetism would be altered. These equations, in their standard form, are based on the experimental observation that magnetic poles always come in pairs.\n\nThe introduction of magnetic monopoles would necessitate changes to the following:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In our universe, this law is expressed as the divergence of the magnetic field **B** being zero (∇ · **B** = 0). This mathematical statement is equivalent to saying there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks of the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges are sources or sinks of the electric field. Consequently, this law would be modified to state that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρm).\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (**E**), expressed as the curl of the electric field (∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t). To create a more symmetric set of equations that includes the movement of magnetic charges (a magnetic current, **J**m), Faraday's Law would be modified. The new form would include a term for the magnetic current, altering the circulation of the electric field.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
