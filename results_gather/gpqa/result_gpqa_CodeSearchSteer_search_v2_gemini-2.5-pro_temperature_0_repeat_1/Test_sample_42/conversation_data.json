    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, a systematic approach based on IUPAC nomenclature rules is necessary.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure:** The molecule is a benzene ring containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, when a -COOH group is attached to a benzene ring, the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the number 1 position (C1).\n\n2.  **Identify and Position the Substituents:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** At C1.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, formyl group):** This is meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5.\n    *   **Cyano group (-CN):** This is also meta to the carboxylic acid and the carbaldehyde. If the carbaldehyde is at C3, the cyano group must be at C5 to be meta to both C1 and C3.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH3):** This is para to the carboxylic acid, which places it at the C4 position.\n    *   **Hydroxyl group (-OH):** This is ortho to the carboxylic acid (C2 or C6). The problem states it is also ortho to the nitrile (cyano group). Since the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. As C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n    *   **Dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2):** This is also ortho to the carboxylic acid. With C6 being occupied by the hydroxyl group, the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n\n3.  **Final Placement of Substituents:**\n    *   C1: Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    *   C2: Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n    *   C3: Formyl (-CHO)\n    *   C4: Methoxy (-OCH3)\n    *   C5: Cyano (-CN)\n    *   C6: Hydroxyl (-OH)\n\n4.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:** The substituents must be listed in alphabetical order in the final name. The prefixes for the substituent names are:\n    *   Cyano\n    *   Dimethylamino\n    *   Formyl\n    *   Hydroxy\n    *   Methoxy\n\n    In alphabetical order, this is: **Cyano, Dimethylamino, Formyl, Hydroxy, Methoxy**.\n\n5.  **Construct the Final IUPAC Name:** Combine the positions and alphabetized names of the substituents with the parent name.\n    *   5-cyano\n    *   2-(dimethylamino)\n    *   3-formyl\n    *   6-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   benzoic acid\n\n    The complete and correct name is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Provided Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect positions and alphabetical order.\n    *   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches the derived name.**\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect positions and alphabetical order.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is the one provided in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
