    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must evaluate each star against two main criteria:\n\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure using a single 8m VLT telescope.\n\n### **ESPRESSO's Detection Limit**\n\nThe performance of ESPRESSO when coupled with a single VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode) indicates that a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 can be achieved for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of 17.1 in a one-hour exposure (three combined 20-minute exposures). Therefore, a star is considered \"detectable\" for this problem if its apparent magnitude is 17.1 or brighter (i.e., the numerical magnitude is less than or equal to 17.1) and it is visible from Paranal.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude dictates which stars are visible in its sky.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Star**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52 degrees. As a southern star, it is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent visual magnitude is -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky. This is significantly brighter than the V=17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89 degrees. Due to its extreme northern position in the sky, it is permanently below the horizon and thus invisible from the Paranal Observatory's southern latitude.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is approximately 1.98.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable** (due to not being visible).\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** With a declination of 0 degrees, this star lies on the celestial equator and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15.0`\n    An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 21.5`\n    An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable** (too faint).\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 13.5`\n    An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of 0 degrees makes it visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 18.5`\n    An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the 17.1 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable** (too faint).\n\n### **Summary**\n\nCounting the stars that meet the criteria:\n1.  Canopus: **Yes**\n2.  Polaris: **No**\n3.  Star at 10 pc: **Yes**\n4.  Star at 200 pc: **No**\n5.  Star at 5 pc: **Yes**\n6.  Star at 50 pc: **No**\n\nA total of **3** stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
