Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can see the spectral lines of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Use the Information Given**\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. An eclipsing binary system means that the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on from our perspective. Therefore, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees, which makes `sin(i)` approximately 1, and `sin³(i)` is also 1.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses: M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving a simpler ratio:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\n**4.

We can keep the units as years and km/s since they will be consistent in the numerator and denominator.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\n\n**5.

For such systems, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law relates the orbital period, the semi-major axis (a), and the total mass of the system.\n2.  **Radial Velocity Information**: For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, we can measure the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of both stars from the Doppler shift of their spectral lines.\n3.  **Inclination Angle (i)**: The observed radial velocities are the line-of-sight components of the orbital velocities and depend on the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight. However, the problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information, as eclipses only occur when the inclination angle *i* is close to 90 degrees (i.e., the system is viewed edge-on). For an inclination of 90°, sin(i) is 1, which simplifies the calculations significantly.\n\nFor a circular orbit in an eclipsing binary system (where sin(i) ≈ 1), the total mass of the system can be derived from the following formula:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2), we can set up a ratio of this equation for the two systems. The constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out.\n\nThe ratio is:\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nM1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.

The key relationship, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`. The fact that the systems are eclipsing tells us the inclination angle is close to 90 degrees, which simplifies the relationship and allows for a direct comparison.\n\n2.  **Set up the ratio.** We need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`. Using the proportionality from step 1, the ratio can be written as:\n    `Ratio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)`\n    Since this is a ratio, the constant of proportionality and the units will cancel out, so we can use the given values directly.\n\n3.  **Assign variables.** I will assign the given values for periods and radial velocities to variables in the Python code.\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `K1a = 10` km/s, `K1b = 5` km/s\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K2a = 15` km/s, `K2b = 10` km/s\n\n4.  **Calculate and print the result.** I will implement the formula in Python, calculate the final numerical value, and print it.

The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system is given by the mass function: `M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))) * (K1 + K2)^3`.\n2.  Since we are asked for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_total_1`) to system_2 (`M_total_2`), the constant term `(1 / (2 * π * G))` cancels out.\n3.  The problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and `sin^3(i)` is also 1 for both systems. This term also cancels out.\n4.  The ratio simplifies to `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`.\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n6.  The ratio is `(2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3) = 2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * (27/125) = 54/125 = 0.432`.\n7.

The mass of a double-lined, eclipsing spectroscopic binary system can be determined using the stars' radial velocities and the orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles\nFor a binary star system, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) through Kepler's Third Law. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the spectral lines of both stars are visible, the relationship is given by:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\nHere, 'G' is the gravitational constant, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. A crucial piece of information is that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on, so the inclination 'i' is approximately 90 degrees.

This requires calculating the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M₁) to the total mass of system_2 (M₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem describes two double-lined spectroscopic binary systems. The total mass of such a system (M_total = m₁ + m₂) is related to its orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of its components (K₁ and K₂) by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    M_total = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Analyze Careful Points & Simplifications:**\n    *   **The \"Eclipsing\" Clue:** This is the most crucial piece of information provided.

This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   **Mathematical Simplification:** When `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This allows us to remove the `sin³(i)` term from the equation, as it does not significantly affect the result.\n    *   **Ratio Calculation:** Since we are calculating a ratio (M₁ / M₂), the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will appear in both the numerator and the denominator and will cancel out.\n    *   **Consistent Units:** As long as the units for period (years) and velocity (km/s) are used consistently for both systems, they will also cancel out in the ratio, eliminating the need for conversion to SI units.\n\n4.  **Derive the Final Formula:** Based on the simplifications, the mass of each system is proportional to `P * (K₁ + K₂)³`.

Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can see the spectral lines of both stars), the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)\n\nwhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Use the Information Given**\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. An eclipsing binary system means that the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on from our perspective. Therefore, we can assume the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees, which makes `sin(i)` approximately 1, and `sin³(i)` is also 1.\n\nThe formula simplifies to:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses: M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving a simpler ratio:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]\n\n**4.

We can keep the units as years and km/s since they will be consistent in the numerator and denominator.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ 2 * (15)³ ] / [ 1 * (25)³ ]\n\n**5.

For such systems, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2).\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law**: This law relates the orbital period, the semi-major axis (a), and the total mass of the system.\n2.  **Radial Velocity Information**: For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, we can measure the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of both stars from the Doppler shift of their spectral lines.\n3.  **Inclination Angle (i)**: The observed radial velocities are the line-of-sight components of the orbital velocities and depend on the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight. However, the problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information, as eclipses only occur when the inclination angle *i* is close to 90 degrees (i.e., the system is viewed edge-on). For an inclination of 90°, sin(i) is 1, which simplifies the calculations significantly.\n\nFor a circular orbit in an eclipsing binary system (where sin(i) ≈ 1), the total mass of the system can be derived from the following formula:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K1 + K2)³\n\nWhere:\n*   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K1 and K2 are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2), we can set up a ratio of this equation for the two systems. The constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out.\n\nThe ratio is:\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n\nM1 / M2 = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.

The key relationship, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`. The fact that the systems are eclipsing tells us the inclination angle is close to 90 degrees, which simplifies the relationship and allows for a direct comparison.\n\n2.  **Set up the ratio.** We need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M_total_1 / M_total_2`. Using the proportionality from step 1, the ratio can be written as:\n    `Ratio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)`\n    Since this is a ratio, the constant of proportionality and the units will cancel out, so we can use the given values directly.\n\n3.  **Assign variables.** I will assign the given values for periods and radial velocities to variables in the Python code.\n    *   `P1 = 2` years\n    *   `K1a = 10` km/s, `K1b = 5` km/s\n    *   `P2 = 1` year\n    *   `K2a = 15` km/s, `K2b = 10` km/s\n\n4.  **Calculate and print the result.** I will implement the formula in Python, calculate the final numerical value, and print it.

The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system is given by the mass function: `M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))) * (K1 + K2)^3`.\n2.  Since we are asked for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_total_1`) to system_2 (`M_total_2`), the constant term `(1 / (2 * π * G))` cancels out.\n3.  The problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. Therefore, `sin(i)` is approximately 1, and `sin^3(i)` is also 1 for both systems. This term also cancels out.\n4.  The ratio simplifies to `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`.\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n6.  The ratio is `(2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3) = 2 * (15/25)^3 = 2 * (3/5)^3 = 2 * (27/125) = 54/125 = 0.432`.\n7.

This means they are \"double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries\".\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K1 and K2). The formula is:\n    M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2 * π * G * sin³(i)]\n    where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the line of sight and the axis of the orbit).\n\n4.  **Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The fact that the systems exhibit eclipses is crucial. It tells us that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°, and therefore `sin(i)` is very close to 1. For our calculation, we can assume `sin(i) = 1`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Mass Formula:** With `sin(i) = 1`, the formula for the total mass simplifies to:\n    M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2 * π * G]\n\n6.  **Set up the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M_system1 / M_system2.\n    M_system1 / M_system2 = { [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³] / [2 * π * G] } / { [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³] / [2 * π * G] }\n\n7.  **Cancel Constant Terms:** The term `2 * π * G` is a universal constant and appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.

Understand the Physics**\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law.

The mass of a double-lined, eclipsing spectroscopic binary system can be determined using the stars' radial velocities and the orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles\nFor a binary star system, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂) through Kepler's Third Law. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the spectral lines of both stars are visible, the relationship is given by:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / (2πG * sin³(i))\n\nHere, 'G' is the gravitational constant, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. A crucial piece of information is that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on, so the inclination 'i' is approximately 90 degrees.
