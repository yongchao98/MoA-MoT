    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the energy spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of the particle is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe options for the energy spectrum are given in terms of quantum numbers n_x and n_y. This is a strong hint that the problem is simpler to solve in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and that the Schrödinger equation will be separable in these coordinates.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nWe use the standard transformation relations between polar and Cartesian coordinates:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r² = x² + y²\n\nNow, we substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))²\nSince x = r cos(θ), we can replace (r cos(θ))² with x²:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\nNow, we group the terms with x² and y²:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n**Step 3: Recognize the Form of the Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx²\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Since the potential is a sum of two independent functions, one of x and one of y, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is separable. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Energy Spectrum for Each Dimension**\n\nWe need to find the energy eigenvalues for each one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). The standard potential for a 1D SHO is V(z) = 1/2 mω²z², and its energy eigenvalues are E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    We have V_x(x) = 2kx². We equate this to the standard form 1/2 mω_x²x² to find the angular frequency ω_x.\n    1/2 mω_x² = 2k\n    ω_x² = 4k/m\n    ω_x = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-motion are:\n    E_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2√(k/m))\n    E_nx = (2n_x + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    We have V_y(y) = 1/2 ky². We equate this to the standard form 1/2 mω_y²y² to find the angular frequency ω_y.\n    1/2 mω_y² = 1/2 k\n    ω_y² = k/m\n    ω_y = √(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion are:\n    E_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the independent motions in the x and y directions:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nNow, we combine the terms inside the brackets:\nE = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ√(k/m)\n\nThe quantum numbers n_x and n_y can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe derived energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ√(k/m).\nLet's compare this with the given choices:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur result matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  The form of the energy options (using n_x, n_y) is a crucial clue to switch from polar to Cartesian coordinates.\n2.  Be careful during the algebraic simplification of the potential after the coordinate transformation.\n3.  Remember the standard formula for the 1D SHO potential (V = 1/2 mω²z²) and its energy eigenvalues (E = (n + 1/2)ħω). A common mistake is to forget the factor of 1/2 or the mass 'm' when determining the frequency ω.\n4.  Correctly calculate the individual frequencies ω_x and ω_y by comparing the derived potential terms with the standard SHO potential form.\n5.  Sum the individual energies E_x and E_y to get the total energy E and simplify the final expression correctly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
