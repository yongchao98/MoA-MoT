    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative), 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is a known method for generating a reactive diene. The four bromine atoms are eliminated to form two new double bonds. The precursor, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, has two -CHBr₂ groups on the sp³-hybridized C5 and C6 atoms of a cyclohexadiene ring. The elimination reaction converts these groups into exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂).\n    2.  The reactive diene formed is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This molecule has a conjugated system of eight π-electrons.\n    3.  This diene then acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile is 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene, which has two strained and reactive double bonds.\n    4.  Since there are 2 equivalents of the diene precursor, two molecules of the generated diene will react with one molecule of the norbornadiene derivative in two successive Diels-Alder reactions, one at each double bond of the norbornadiene.\n*   **Product 1:** The result is a complex, symmetric polycyclic molecule (a bis-adduct) with a central 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Analysis:** Aqueous acid is a standard condition for the deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at the C7 position is cleaved to form a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2:** Product 2 is the same complex polycyclic molecule as 1, but with a secondary alcohol at the C7 position instead of the tert-butyl ether.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at C7 in product 2 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** Product 3 is the corresponding ketone, with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C7 position of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Analysis:** Diels-Alder reactions are often reversible. Heating a Diels-Alder adduct can cause a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking the adduct down into its original diene and dienophile components.\n    1.  Product 3, being a double Diels-Alder adduct, will fragment upon heating.\n    2.  The fragmentation will regenerate two molecules of the diene (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) and one molecule of the dienophile.\n    3.  The dienophile that is regenerated is the ketone version of the original norbornadiene derivative: **7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene** (or 7-oxonorbornadiene).\n    4.  7-oxonorbornadiene is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a further fragmentation (a retro-[4+2+1] cycloaddition) to extrude a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form **benzene**. This decomposition is very rapid at 150°C.\n*   **Final Products:** The final mixture contains benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for the analysis of \"final product 4\". Since benzene would give only 1 signal for its hydrogens (not an option) and CO has no hydrogens, product 4 must refer to the major organic product of interest, which is the diene.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with double bonds at C1=C2 and C3=C4, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at C5 and C6. There are a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2=C3 bond and the C5-C6 bond. This axis relates the left and right halves of the molecule.\n    *   The molecule is not planar due to the 8π-electron cyclic system (similar to cyclooctatetraene, it adopts a non-planar \"tub\" conformation). This lack of a mirror plane perpendicular to the C₂ axis means the point group is C₂.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** We can determine the number of distinct hydrogen environments by considering the C₂ symmetry.\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4. (1 set)\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3. (1 set)\n    3.  The C₂ axis makes the two methylidene (=CH₂) groups equivalent. However, within each =CH₂ group, the two hydrogens are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because the molecule as a whole is chiral (it belongs to the C₂ point group). Let's call them H_inner and H_outer.\n    4.  The C₂ rotation maps the H_inner of one CH₂ group to the H_inner of the other CH₂ group. So, the two H_inner protons are equivalent to each other. (1 set)\n    5.  Similarly, the two H_outer protons are equivalent to each other. (1 set)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** There are four distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n    1.  {H on C1, H on C4}\n    2.  {H on C2, H on C3}\n    3.  {The two \"inner\" hydrogens on the =CH₂ groups}\n    4.  {The two \"outer\" hydrogens on the =CH₂ groups}\n\nTherefore, there are 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
