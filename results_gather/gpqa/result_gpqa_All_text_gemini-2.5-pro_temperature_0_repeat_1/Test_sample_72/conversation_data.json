    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given information and what needs to be calculated.**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: `m₁ = 2m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: `v₁ = 0.6c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: `m₂ = 3m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: `v₂ = 0.5c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   We need to find the relative speed (`v_rel`) between the two astronauts and the total energy (`E_total`) of the system as observed from a stationary frame.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel).**\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we cannot simply subtract the velocities (`0.6c - 0.5c`). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n*   The formula for the relative velocity `v_rel` of an object with velocity `v₁` with respect to another object with velocity `v₂` (both moving in the same direction in a stationary frame) is:\n    `v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n*   Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n*   Simplify the numerator:\n    `0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`\n*   Simplify the denominator:\n    `1 - (0.30 * c²) / c² = 1 - 0.30 = 0.7`\n*   Calculate the final relative speed:\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c`\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total energy of the system (E_total).**\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is not just its kinetic energy but its total energy, which includes its rest mass energy. The formula is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n*   The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   First, calculate the energy of astronaut 1 (`E₁`):\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (`γ₁`):\n        `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v₁²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Calculate the energy of astronaut 1:\n        `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n*   Next, calculate the energy of astronaut 2 (`E₂`):\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (`γ₂`):\n        `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v₂²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   Calculate the energy of astronaut 2:\n        `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c² = (6 / sqrt(3)) * mc² = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc²`\n        `E₂ ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n*   Finally, calculate the total energy of the system by summing the individual energies:\n    `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 2 * sqrt(3) * mc²`\n    `E_total = (2.5 + 2 * sqrt(3)) mc²`\n    `E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc² ≈ 5.964 mc²`\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the results with the given options.**\n*   Our calculated relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n*   Our calculated total energy is `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n*   These values match option B.\n\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2 (Incorrect. Relative speed cannot exceed c.)\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2 (Correct.)\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2 (Incorrect. Uses non-relativistic velocity subtraction.)\nD) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2 (Incorrect. Energy calculation is based on rest mass only, `(2m+3m)c²`, which is wrong.)\n\n<<<B>>>"
