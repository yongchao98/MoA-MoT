    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Observability Criteria for Both Observatories**\n\nTo be observed by both instruments, a star must meet two criteria: it must be visible in the sky from both locations (a positional requirement), and it must be bright enough for both spectrographs (a magnitude requirement).\n\n**A. Positional Criterion (Declination)**\n\nA star's visibility from a specific latitude on Earth depends on its declination (DEC). A star is considered visible if it rises above the horizon.\n\n1.  **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Location: Atacama Desert, Chile.\n    *   Latitude: Approximately 24° South (L ≈ -24°).\n    *   A star is visible from Paranal if its declination `δ` is greater than the latitude minus 90° (`δ > L - 90°`) and less than the latitude plus 90° (`δ < L + 90°`). However, the practical limit for a star to rise above the horizon is that its declination must be less than `90° - |L|` in the opposite hemisphere.\n    *   The condition for a star to rise above the horizon at latitude L is `δ > L - 90°`. For Paranal, `δ > -24° - 90° = -114°`. Since declination is always between -90° and +90°, this condition is always met for the southern celestial hemisphere.\n    *   The northernmost declination visible is limited. A star at the north celestial pole (DEC = +90°) would be permanently below the horizon. A star is visible if its maximum altitude is greater than 0. The maximum altitude is `90° - |L - δ|`.\n    *   For Paranal: `90° - |-24° - δ| > 0` => `|-24° - δ| < 90°`. This inequality resolves to `-90° < -24° - δ < 90°`, which means **DEC < +66°**.\n\n2.  **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):**\n    *   Location: Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA.\n    *   Latitude: Approximately 20° North (L ≈ +20°).\n    *   Using the same logic, we find the southern declination limit.\n    *   For Keck: `90° - |+20° - δ| > 0` => `|+20° - δ| < 90°`. This inequality resolves to `-90° < 20° - δ < 90°`, which means **DEC > -70°**.\n\n3.  **Combined Criterion:**\n    *   For a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range.\n    *   **-70° < DEC < +66°**\n\n**B. Brightness Criterion (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\nThe star must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of both instruments. \"Brighter\" means a smaller magnitude value.\n\n1.  **ESPRESSO Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (V) < 17.0 mag.\n2.  **HIRES Limit:** Apparent V magnitude (V) < 16.0 mag.\n3.  **Combined Criterion:** To be detected by both, the star must satisfy the stricter limit.\n    *   **V < 16.0 mag**\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Star Against the Criteria**\n\nWe will now check each star's declination and apparent V magnitude.\n\n**Key Formula:** The apparent magnitude (V) is related to the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance in parsecs (d), and absorption in the V band (A_V) by the distance modulus formula:\n`V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`\nwhere `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star 1**\n*   DEC = -75°\n*   **Declination Check:** -75° is **not** within the required range of -70° to +66°. It is too far south to be seen from Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2**\n*   DEC = +55°\n*   Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag\n*   **Declination Check:** +55° is within the range -70° to +66°. (Pass)\n*   **Magnitude Check:** V = 16.5 mag is **not** brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 3**\n*   DEC = +48°\n*   Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag\n*   **Declination Check:** +48° is within the range -70° to +66°. (Pass)\n*   **Magnitude Check:** V = 15.5 mag is brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag. (Pass)\n    *   *Note: The problem provides an \"apparent V magnitude\", which by definition is the brightness as seen from Earth, including any extinction. The additional information about E(B-V) and distance is extraneous.*\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be detected by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Star 4**\n*   DEC = -48°\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag, distance (d) = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   **Declination Check:** -48° is within the range -70° to +66°. (Pass)\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude V.\n    *   First, calculate the absorption: `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   Next, use the distance modulus formula: `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(1) + 1.24`\n    *   `V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n    *   V = 16.74 mag is **not** brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5**\n*   DEC = +60°\n*   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag, distance (d) = 5 pc\n*   **Declination Check:** +60° is within the range -70° to +66°. (Pass)\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude V. (Assume A_V = 0 as no extinction is mentioned).\n    *   `V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5)`\n    *   `V = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301)`\n    *   `V = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995` mag.\n    *   V ≈ 15.0 mag is brighter than the required V < 16.0 mag. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be detected by both.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, **Star3** and **Star5** are the only stars that meet both the positional (declination) and brightness (apparent magnitude) requirements for observation with both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
