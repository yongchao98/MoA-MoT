    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In stellar abundance analysis, this is interpreted as the ratio of their number densities relative to hydrogen, which is the primary constituent of a star's photosphere. So, we need to calculate the ratio: `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Notation:** The notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance of element X relative to element Y in a star, compared to the Sun. The formula is:\n    `[X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )`\n    A useful property of this notation is that abundances can be combined. For any elements X, Y, and Z:\n    `[X/Z] = [X/Y] + [Y/Z]`\n\n3.  **Analyze Star_1:**\n    *   We are given the abundances for Star_1: `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`.\n    *   Our goal is to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`.\n    *   Using the property from Step 2, we can write: `[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`.\n    *   Substituting the given values: `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`.\n    *   Now, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_1`:\n        `[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = 0.3`\n    *   This can be rearranged to express the silicon abundance in Star_1 in terms of the Sun's silicon abundance:\n        `(n_Si / n_H)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n4.  **Analyze Star_2:**\n    *   We are given the abundances for Star_2: `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`.\n    *   Our goal is to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_2`.\n    *   Using the property from Step 2, we can write: `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`.\n    *   Substituting the given values: `0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2`.\n    *   Solving for `[Si/H]_2`: `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`.\n    *   Now, we use the definition of `[Si/H]_2`:\n        `[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) = -0.3`\n    *   This can be rearranged to express the silicon abundance in Star_2 in terms of the Sun's silicon abundance:\n        `(n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   We need to compute the ratio: `Ratio = (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions from Step 3 and Step 4:\n        `Ratio = ( 10^0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n    *   The term for the Sun's silicon abundance, `(n_Si / n_H)_sun`, cancels out.\n        `Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n    *   Using the rules of exponents (`a^x / a^y = a^(x-y)`):\n        `Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^(0.3 + 0.3) = 10^0.6`\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        `10^0.6 ≈ 3.981`\n\n6.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The masses of the stars (1.5 and 1.2 M_sun) and the absolute solar abundances (`12 + log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5` and `12 + log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7`) are not needed to solve this problem. They are included to make the problem appear more complex.\n    *   **Notation:** It is crucial to correctly understand and manipulate the `[X/Y]` notation. The key is realizing that `[X/Z] = [X/Y] + [Y/Z]`.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The \"ratio of silicon atoms\" is correctly interpreted as the ratio of their abundance fractions, `(n_Si/nH)`.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by the ratio of their silicon-to-hydrogen abundances.\n\nRatio = `(n_Si/nH)_1 / (n_Si/nH)_2`\n\nFrom the analysis above, we found:\n*   `(n_Si/nH)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/nH)_sun`\n*   `(n_Si/nH)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_Si/nH)_sun`\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\nRatio = `10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<A>>>"
