    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2. This can be expressed as the factor `F = M_system1 / M_system2`.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 1a (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 1b (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 2a (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of Star 2b (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles and Formulas:**\n    *   The problem describes spectroscopic binary systems. For such systems, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n    *   The formula for the total mass of a binary system is:\n        `M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ((K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i))`\n        where:\n        *   `P` is the orbital period.\n        *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n        *   `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n        *   `i` is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Careful Points\":**\n    *   **Eclipsing Systems:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. For an eclipse to be observed, the orbital plane must be aligned very closely with our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   **Simplification:** If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n    *   **Proportionality:** With `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`, the mass formula shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n        `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n    *   **Units:** Since we are calculating a ratio of two masses, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` will cancel out. We can work directly with the given units (years and km/s) as long as they are consistent for both systems.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Proportional Mass for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocities = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   `M_system1 ∝ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3`\n        *   `M_system1 ∝ 2 * (15)^3`\n\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocities = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n        *   `M_system2 ∝ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3`\n        *   `M_system2 ∝ 1 * (25)^3`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   The factor `F` is the ratio `M_system1 / M_system2`.\n    *   `F = (2 * 15^3) / (1 * 25^3)`\n    *   `F = 2 * (15 / 25)^3`\n    *   Simplify the fraction inside the parenthesis: `15 / 25 = 3 / 5`.\n    *   `F = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n    *   `F = 2 * (3^3 / 5^3)`\n    *   `F = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    *   `F = 54 / 125`\n    *   `F = 0.432`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated factor is 0.432.\n    *   A) ~ 0.6\n    *   B) ~ 1.2\n    *   C) ~ 0.7\n    *   D) ~ 0.4\n    *   The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTherefore, system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
