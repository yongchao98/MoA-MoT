    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   **Initial State Vector:** The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n*   **Operator P:** The matrix for the observable P is `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`.\n*   **Operator Q:** The matrix for the observable Q is `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`.\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nBefore calculating probabilities, the state vector must be normalized.\n*   Calculate the squared norm: `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n*   The normalized initial state is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n**3. First Measurement: Measuring P and getting the value 0**\n\nThis part involves two steps: finding the eigenvector for P=0 and then calculating the probability of measuring it.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for P=0:** We need to find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ=0` for the operator P. This means solving the equation `P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This leads to the system of equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]^T`. To normalize it, we set its length to 1: `c² + 0² + (-c)² = 1` => `2c² = 1` => `c = 1/√2`.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for P=0 is `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:** The probability is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector: `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) * ((1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n**4. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring P and getting the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n*   The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Measuring Q and getting the value -1**\n\nNow we perform the measurement of Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q=-1:** The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:** This is the conditional probability `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`. We calculate it by projecting the new state `|ψ'⟩` onto the eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩`: `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = ([0, 0, 1]) * ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T)`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the probabilities calculated in the steps above.\n*   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n*   `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   Always normalize the initial state vector before any calculations.\n*   The state of the system changes (collapses) after a measurement. Subsequent measurements are performed on this new state.\n*   The probability of a specific outcome is the squared magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the current state with the normalized eigenvector corresponding to that outcome.\n*   For a sequence of measurements, the total probability is the product of the probability of the first outcome and the conditional probability of the second outcome given the first.\n\nThe final answer is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
