    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept: Redshift**\n    The expansion of the universe causes light from distant objects to be \"stretched\" to longer wavelengths. This phenomenon is called redshift, denoted by 'z'. The relationship between the wavelength of light as it was emitted (the rest wavelength, λ_rest) and the wavelength we observe on Earth (λ_observed) is given by the formula:\n    λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information**\n    *   **Spectral Line:** The absorption is at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (λ_rest):** The rest wavelength of the Lyα line is given as ~1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Detection Method:** The detection is performed using \"optical ground-based telescopes\".\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Constraint**\n    The crucial part of the question is the term \"optical ground-based telescopes\". This imposes a physical limitation on what can be observed.\n    *   The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, primarily due to absorption by the ozone layer.\n    *   Light with wavelengths shorter than a certain \"atmospheric cutoff\" cannot reach a telescope on the ground.\n    *   The \"optical window\" for ground-based astronomy begins where the atmosphere becomes transparent. This happens in the near-ultraviolet, at a wavelength of approximately 3200 Å to 3500 Å. For a signal to be detected, its observed wavelength must be longer than this cutoff.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Problem**\n    We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift. This means we need to find the smallest value of 'z' that will shift the Lyα line from its rest wavelength of 1216 Å just enough so that it can pass through the atmosphere and be detected. In other words, we need to find the redshift 'z' that shifts the 1216 Å line to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n\n    Let's set the minimum observable wavelength (λ_observed_min) to be the atmospheric cutoff. A standard, practical value for this cutoff is around 3500 Å.\n    λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å\n\n5.  **Calculate the Redshift**\n    Now, we use the redshift formula to solve for 'z':\n    λ_observed_min = λ_rest * (1 + z_min)\n    3500 Å = 1216 Å * (1 + z_min)\n\n    To find z_min, we rearrange the equation:\n    1 + z_min = 3500 / 1216\n    1 + z_min ≈ 2.878\n    z_min ≈ 2.878 - 1\n    z_min ≈ 1.878\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The calculated lower limit for the redshift is z ≈ 1.88. Let's compare this with the given multiple-choice options:\n    A) 1.9\n    B) 1.2\n    C) 3\n    D) 2.4\n\n    Our calculated value of 1.88 is extremely close to option A, 1.9.\n\n### Careful Points and Verification\n\n*   **Why not the other options?**\n    *   **z = 1.2:** λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.2) = 2675 Å. This is deep in the UV and would be completely blocked by the atmosphere. Not detectable.\n    *   **z = 2.4:** λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 4134 Å. This is in the violet part of the visible spectrum and is easily detectable. However, since a lower redshift of z=1.9 is also detectable, z=2.4 cannot be the *lower limit*.\n    *   **z = 3:** λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 3) = 4864 Å. This is in the blue-green part of the spectrum and is also easily detectable. It is not the lower limit.\n\n*   **The choice of atmospheric cutoff wavelength:** The exact value of the atmospheric cutoff can vary depending on atmospheric conditions and the sensitivity of the instrument. However, a value between 3200 Å and 3500 Å is standard. Using 3500 Å leads directly to the answer 1.9. If we had used 3200 Å, we would get z ≈ 1.63, which is not among the options but still points towards 1.9 being the most plausible lower boundary among the choices.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Å must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than the atmospheric UV cutoff (~3500 Å) to be seen by a ground-based telescope. A redshift of z ≈ 1.9 shifts the line to ~3526 Å, which is just inside the observable window. This represents the smallest redshift, or the lower limit, among the given options that allows for detection.\n\n<<<A>>>"
