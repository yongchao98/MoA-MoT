    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy Components**\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical point charges.\n*   One charge, `q_c = 2e`, is fixed at a central point P.\n*   Twelve charges, `q_s = 2e`, are constrained to the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2` m, centered at P.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can divide this into two main parts:\n1.  `U_cs`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_ss`: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\n`U_total = U_cs + U_ss`\n\n**2. Analyze the Minimum Energy Condition**\n\n*   The distance between the central charge and any of the 12 sphere charges is always `R = 2` m. Therefore, the energy component `U_cs` is constant, regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere.\n*   To find the minimum total energy of the system, we need to find the configuration of the 12 sphere charges that minimizes their mutual potential energy, `U_ss`.\n*   Since all 12 charges are identical and repel each other, they will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This classic problem is known as the **Thomson problem**. For `N=12` charges on a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy `U_cs`**\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge `q_c` and one sphere charge `q_s` is `U_pair = k * q_c * q_s / R`.\nSince there are 12 such charges on the sphere:\n`U_cs = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e) / R) = 12 * (k * 4e² / R)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Potential Energy `U_ss`**\n\nFor 12 charges at the vertices of an icosahedron, we need to sum the potential energies for all pairs. The number of pairs is `12 * 11 / 2 = 66`.\nIn an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R`, there are three distinct distances between vertices:\n*   **Edge length (`a`):** Each vertex has 5 nearest neighbors. The total number of such pairs (edges) is `(12 * 5) / 2 = 30`.\n*   **Short diagonal (`d_2`):** Each vertex has 5 second-nearest neighbors. The total number of such pairs is `(12 * 5) / 2 = 30`. The distance is `d_2 = a * φ`, where `φ = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 ≈ 1.618` is the golden ratio.\n*   **Long diagonal (diameter, `d_3`):** Each vertex has 1 opposite (antipodal) vertex. The total number of such pairs is `(12 * 1) / 2 = 6`. The distance is `d_3 = 2R`.\n\nThe relationship between the edge length `a` and the circumradius `R` is:\n`a = R * sqrt((10 - 2*sqrt(5)) / 5)`\n\nNow, we can write the expression for `U_ss`:\n`U_ss = k * (2e)² * [ (30 / a) + (30 / (aφ)) + (6 / (2R)) ]`\n`U_ss = k * 4e² * [ (30/a) * (1 + 1/φ) + 3/R ]`\nUsing the property of the golden ratio `1 + 1/φ = φ`:\n`U_ss = k * 4e² * [ 30φ/a + 3/R ]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy `U_total`**\n\nNow, we sum the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_cs + U_ss`\n`U_total = (12 * k * 4e² / R) + k * 4e² * [ 30φ/a + 3/R ]`\n`U_total = k * 4e² * [ 12/R + 30φ/a + 3/R ]`\n`U_total = k * 4e² * [ 15/R + 30φ/a ]`\n\nTo simplify for calculation, we can factor out `1/R`:\n`U_total = (k * 4e² / R) * [ 15 + 30φ * (R/a) ]`\n\n**6. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's find the value of the geometric ratio `R/a`:\n`a/R = sqrt((10 - 2*sqrt(5)) / 5) ≈ sqrt((10 - 2 * 2.23607) / 5) ≈ sqrt(1.10557) ≈ 1.05146`\n`R/a = 1 / 1.05146 ≈ 0.95106`\n\nNow, calculate the dimensionless factor in the brackets:\n`[ 15 + 30φ * (R/a) ] ≈ [ 15 + 30 * 1.61803 * 0.95106 ] ≈ [ 15 + 46.165 ] = 61.165`\n\nNext, calculate the energy unit `k * 4e² / R`:\n*   `k` (Coulomb's constant) ≈ `8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   `e` (elementary charge) ≈ `1.60218 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `R = 2` m\n*   `4e² = 4 * (1.60218 × 10^-19)² ≈ 1.02679 × 10^-37 C²`\n\n`k * 4e² / R ≈ (8.98755 × 10^9 * 1.02679 × 10^-37) / 2`\n`≈ (9.2286 × 10^-28) / 2 ≈ 4.6143 × 10^-28 J`\n\nFinally, multiply the two parts:\n`U_total ≈ (4.6143 × 10^-28 J) * 61.165`\n`U_total ≈ 282.23 × 10^-28 J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8223 × 10^-26 J`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated minimum energy is `2.822 × 10^-26 J` when corrected to three decimals. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
