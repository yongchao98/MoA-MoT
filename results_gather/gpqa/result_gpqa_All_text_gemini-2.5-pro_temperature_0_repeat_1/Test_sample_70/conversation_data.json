    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, 'a'). The energy absorbed by the planet must equal the energy it radiates. This balance leads to the following relationship:\n    `T_eq^4 ∝ (1 - A) / a^2`\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n    `T_eq ∝ ((1 - A) / a^2)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / a^(1/2)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions:**\n    *   The problem states that all planets have the same albedo (A). This means the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term is a constant for all planets in the system.\n    *   Therefore, for the purpose of finding a ratio between two planets in the same system, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n    *   This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Radius (a) to Orbital Period (P):** We are given the ratio of orbital periods (P), not orbital radii (a). We need to connect these two quantities using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. For planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    `P^2 ∝ a^3`\n    To express 'a' in terms of 'P', we can rearrange this proportionality:\n    `a^3 ∝ P^2`\n    `a ∝ (P^2)^(1/3)`\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships to Express Temperature in Terms of Period:** Now we substitute the relationship from Step 4 into the simplified temperature relationship from Step 3.\n    *   We have `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n    *   And `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n    *   Substituting 'a' gives: `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n    *   Multiplying the exponents: `T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))`\n    *   `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    *   This crucial result shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Temperatures:** Now we can set up the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2 using the proportionality from Step 5.\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods: P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   From this, we can see that the ratio of the period of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is:\n        `P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n8.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** Substitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio equation.\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    First, simplify the fraction:\n    `2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4 / 7`\n    Now, calculate the cube root:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)`\n    `4 / 7 ≈ 0.5714`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n    Calculating the cube root gives:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.83. This matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** It is essential to correctly apply `P^2 ∝ a^3` to relate the given period data to the orbital radius needed for the temperature calculation.\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The key dependence is `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`. Forgetting the square root is a common mistake.\n*   **Simplification:** Recognizing that the star's luminosity and the planets' albedos are constant for the ratio calculation simplifies the problem significantly.\n*   **Ratio Order:** The question asks for T_eq4 / T_eq2, so the final ratio of periods must be set up correctly as `(P2 / P4)^(1/3)`. A common error would be to calculate `(P4 / P2)^(1/3)`, which would give the inverse result.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The TTV method and circular orbits are provided as context. While they confirm the physical scenario (gravitational interaction in a resonant system, simplified geometry), they are not directly used in the final calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
