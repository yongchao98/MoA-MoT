    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   **Interpretation of DoU:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is typically a double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide would also have bands in this region but other features would differ.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is too high for a simple amide (typically ~1680 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The data strongly suggests the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methyl group next to a methylene group (-CH₂-), which is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methylene group next to a methyl group. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). These protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening. This confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which corresponds to a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl). The doublet at 7.0 ppm is more upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Verify**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nLet's put these pieces together: The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Check against formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. The structure has a C₆H₄ ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -COOCH₂CH₃ group. Total atoms: (C₆+C₁+C₂) + (H₄+H₂+H₅) + N + O₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. The formula matches.\n*   **Check against spectra:** The structure has all the required functional groups and proton environments to explain the IR and NMR data perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the oxygen is attached to the ring, and the carbonyl is part of a propyl chain. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (CH₃CH₂C=O), with the -CH₂- appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. The IR would show one N-H band, and the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the analytical data derived above.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (C=O stretch would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
