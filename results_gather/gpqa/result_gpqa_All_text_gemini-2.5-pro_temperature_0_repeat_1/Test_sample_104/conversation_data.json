    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the scenario and identify the key physical principles.**\n\nThe problem describes a star with rotational modulation in its brightness caused by a hemisphere covered in starspots. This brightness variation is then compared to the dimming caused by a transiting exoplanet. The core physical principle is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the flux (energy radiated per unit area per unit time) of a blackbody to its temperature: F = σT⁴. The total brightness (luminosity) is the flux multiplied by the emitting area, L = AσT⁴. We will be comparing the relative change in brightness in two different scenarios.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the brightness variation due to the starspots.**\n\nWe need to find the maximum and minimum brightness of the star as it rotates. The amplitude of the variation is given by (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the observer sees the unspotted hemisphere. The entire visible disk of the star has a uniform temperature T_eff.\n    *   Let the radius of the star be R_star. The area of the visible disk is A_disk = πR_star².\n    *   The flux is proportional to the area multiplied by T⁴. So, F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴ = (πR_star²) * T_eff⁴.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the observer sees the spotted hemisphere. This hemisphere has a filling factor `f` of 0.20 (or 20%) for spots. This means 20% of the visible disk's area is covered by spots at temperature T_spot, and the remaining 80% is at the normal temperature T_eff.\n    *   Area of spots on the visible disk: A_spot = f * A_disk = 0.20 * (πR_star²).\n    *   Area of the unspotted part on the visible disk: A_unspot = (1 - f) * A_disk = 0.80 * (πR_star²).\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted parts.\n    *   F_min ∝ (A_unspot * T_eff⁴) + (A_spot * T_spot⁴)\n    *   F_min ∝ [(1 - f) * (πR_star²) * T_eff⁴] + [f * (πR_star²) * T_spot⁴]\n    *   F_min ∝ (πR_star²) * [(1 - f)T_eff⁴ + fT_spot⁴]\n\n*   **Calculate the Amplitude (A_spot):**\n    *   A_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    *   The term (πR_star²) is common to all terms and cancels out.\n    *   A_spot = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f)T_eff⁴ + fT_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n    *   A_spot = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + fT_eff⁴ - fT_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\n    *   A_spot = [fT_eff⁴ - fT_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\n    *   A_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n*   **Plug in the values:**\n    *   f = 0.20\n    *   T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   A_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\n    *   A_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n    *   A_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\n    *   A_spot = 0.20 * ((1296 - 625) / 1296)\n    *   A_spot = 0.20 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the brightness variation due to a transiting exoplanet.**\n\nThe problem asks for the size of a planet that would produce the *same amplitude* signal. The amplitude of a transit signal is the fraction of the star's light that is blocked by the planet.\n\n*   **Amplitude (A_planet):** This is simply the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    *   Area of the planet's disk: A_pl = πR_pl²\n    *   Area of the star's disk: A_star = πR_star²\n    *   A_planet = A_pl / A_star = (πR_pl²) / (πR_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**Step 4: Equate the two amplitudes and solve for the planet-to-star radius ratio (R_pl / R_star).**\n\nWe are given that the amplitudes must be the same: A_planet = A_spot.\n\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = A_spot\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n*   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n*   R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.3218 is very close to option B.\n\n*   A) ~0.11\n*   B) ~0.32\n*   C) ~0.07\n*   D) ~0.39\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The problem simplifies the situation by having one hemisphere fully spotted and the other fully clear, allowing us to easily define F_max and F_min.\n*   We assume the filling factor `f` applies to the projected disk area when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n*   We ignore effects like limb darkening, which would make the calculation more complex but would not drastically change the result for this kind of estimation.\n*   The temperature of the spots is T_eff minus the difference, not just the difference itself.\n*   The amplitude of a transit is proportional to the *area* ratio, which means it's the square of the *radius* ratio. This is a common point of error.\n\n<<<B>>>"
