    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. In the context of a bubble chamber, \"observing a decay\" means being able to see the track of the particle before it decays. If the particle travels a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not resolved, and the decay is not \"observed\" as happening at a distance from the creation point. Therefore, to observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance $d$ that is greater than the resolution, let's call it $L_{res}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physical Condition:** We need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ such that the fraction of particles that travel a distance $d > L_{res}$ is at least 30% (or 0.3).\n    The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $d$ or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(d > L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the lab frame (the bubble chamber).\n    So, the condition is:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length depends on the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$).\n    *   **Relativistic Parameters:** The particle is moving at relativistic speeds. We first need to calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n        Given:\n        Total Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n        Rest Mass $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n    *   **Lifetime in Lab Frame ($\\tau$):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n        Given:\n        Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        $\\tau = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying, $\\lambda = v \\tau$. A more direct way to calculate this without finding $v$ explicitly is using the particle's momentum ($p$).\n        The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0$.\n        First, find the momentum $p$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n        Now, calculate $\\lambda$:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Resolution ($L_{res}$):** Now we use the condition from Step 2 with our calculated mean decay length $\\lambda$.\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n    To solve for $L_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} \\ge \\ln(0.3)$\n    Multiplying by $-\\lambda$ reverses the inequality sign:\n    $L_{res} \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This is often interpreted as the boundary condition, i.e., the largest possible value for the resolution that still satisfies the requirement. Any resolution smaller than this value would also work (and would observe more than 30% of decays).\n    Let's calculate this maximum allowable resolution:\n    $L_{res, max} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(0.3)$\n    $L_{res, max} \\approx -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $L_{res, max} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. We need to find the closest option provided.\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-9 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\n    The value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is numerically closest to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (~9%) is likely due to rounding or slight inaccuracies in the problem's given values. Option C represents a resolution that is smaller than our calculated maximum ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} < 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$), so it satisfies the condition of observing *at least* 30% of the decays.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Proper Lifetime vs. Lab Lifetime:** It is crucial to use the time-dilated lifetime ($\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$) for calculations in the lab frame.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** Use the correct relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma m_0 c^2$) and momentum ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$). Do not use classical approximations.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Observe\":** Correctly interpret that observing a decay requires the track length to be greater than the detector's resolution.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The probability of a particle *surviving* for a distance $L_{res}$ is $P(d > L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda}$. This is the fraction of decays that are observable.\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Minimum Resolution\":** This term can be confusing. It does not mean the smallest possible number. In this context, it refers to the least stringent requirement for the detector, which corresponds to the largest numerical value of resolution that still meets the 30% observation criterion.\n\nFinal check: With a resolution of $L_{res} = 2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-2.08 \\times 10^{-6} / 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx e^{-1.103} \\approx 0.33$, which is indeed greater than 0.3 (30%).\n\n<<<C>>>"
