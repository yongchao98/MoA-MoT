    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Experimental Setup**\nThe primary goal is to overexpress a recombinant GADD45G protein in a mouse model to study its interactions. To facilitate purification and detection, the protein is engineered to have an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at its N-terminus. The experiment involves creating a plasmid with this modified gene, transfecting it into CHO cells, and then checking for protein expression.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Problem**\nThe experiment fails. The expected full-length, HA-tagged GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed. The key piece of evidence provided is the DNA sequence of the construct's plus strand (the coding strand).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence**\nThe sequence needs to be analyzed in the context of gene expression, specifically translation. Translation starts at a start codon (ATG) and proceeds by reading codons (groups of three nucleotides) until a stop codon is reached.\n\n*   **Identify the Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`. `ATG` codes for Methionine and is the universal start codon. This is correct.\n*   **Identify the HA Tag Sequence:** The problem states an HA tag is at the N-terminus. The peptide sequence for a standard HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate the DNA sequence following the `ATG` start codon to see if it matches.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The DNA sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for the HA tag peptide `YPYDVPDYA`. So, the tag sequence itself is correct.\n\n*   **Continue Translating Past the HA Tag:** Now, let's examine the nucleotides immediately following the HA tag sequence.\n    *   The sequence after `...GCC` is `AAA TGA...`.\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> **STOP**\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Cause of Failure**\nThe codon `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters this codon in the mRNA (transcribed as `UGA`), it does not add an amino acid. Instead, a release factor binds, and translation is terminated. The ribosome detaches from the mRNA, and the newly synthesized polypeptide is released.\n\nIn this case, translation will stop after the Lysine (K) codon. The resulting protein will be extremely short, consisting only of the start Methionine, the HA tag, and one Lysine residue (Met-YPYDVPDYA-Lys). The full-length GADD45G protein will never be synthesized. This directly explains why the researcher is \"unable to overexpress [the] protein as expected.\"\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what our analysis shows. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon causes early termination. This is the correct explanation.\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** Our analysis showed that the DNA sequence for the HA tag correctly codes for the YPYDVPDYA peptide. There is no mutation within the tag itself. This option is incorrect.\n*   **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important for proper protein folding, their absence does not directly cause proteolysis. The primary issue here is that the full-length protein is not even being synthesized in the first place, not that it's being made and then degraded. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is biologically incorrect. Stop codons (like UAA, UAG, and UGA) are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. Furthermore, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA` (mRNA: `UGA`), not `TAA` (mRNA: `UAA`). This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe definitive reason for the failed experiment, as revealed by the DNA sequence, is the presence of a premature stop codon that causes translation to halt before the GADD45G protein can be synthesized.\n\n<<<A>>>"
