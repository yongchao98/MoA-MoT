    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. The compounds given with specific stereochemical descriptors (like R, S) are considered as single enantiomers, which are optically active if the molecule is chiral.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Chirality:** A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Chiral Center:** A common source of chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Elements of Symmetry:** A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry (Ïƒ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   **Meso Compounds:** These are achiral molecules that contain chiral centers. They are achiral due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Stereochemical Descriptors (R/S):** If a name includes R/S descriptors, it refers to a specific stereoisomer. If this stereoisomer is one of a pair of enantiomers, it is optically active. If it describes a meso compound, it is optically inactive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms attached to the double bond carbons (C1 and C2) lie in the same plane.\n        ```\n            Cl   CH3\n             \\ /\n              C=C\n             / \\\n            H   CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)` specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of `R` and `S` confirms the existence of chiral centers. The parent structure without the `=CHCl` group is a meso compound, but the substituent on the methano-bridge (C8) destroys all planes of symmetry. Since the molecule has chiral centers and lacks internal symmetry, it is chiral. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as `(2R,3S)`. This particular combination of stereocenters results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry that lies between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n        H --- C --- CH3\n        ------|------  <-- Plane of symmetry\n        CH3 -- C --- H\n              |\n              COOH\n        (A possible conformation with a plane of symmetry)\n        ```\n    *   A molecule with chiral centers but also an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as `(2R,3R)`. This stereoisomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are a pair of enantiomers. As a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule, and the `(R)` designation refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This highly symmetrical molecule possesses three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one carbon bearing an -OH group and the carbon atom directly opposite it (e.g., a plane containing C1 and C4). The presence of even one plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The IUPAC name describes the following structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers or other elements of chirality. The only potential chiral center in the chain is C3, but it is bonded to two identical methyl groups (`(CH3)2CH-`), so it is not a chiral center. The cyclopentyl ring is also symmetrically attached. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the `H-C3-C2-C1=O` atoms and bisects the two methyl groups on C3 and the cyclopentyl ring. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Count**\n\nLet's summarize which compounds are optically active:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Active**\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
