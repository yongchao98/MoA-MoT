    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We have a solution containing Cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) and thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`).\n*   These ions react to form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`.\n*   The goal is to find the percentage of one specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex), relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Total Cobalt Concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M\n*   Thiocyanate Concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Overall Stability Constants (β):\n    *   `β₁ = 9` for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂ = 40` for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃ = 63` for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄ = 16` for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Define the Species in Solution**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Complex Concentrations using Stability Constants**\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the corresponding stability constant `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 4 into the equation from Step 3:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactor out the common term `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Formulate the Expression for the Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`**\n\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100%`\n\n**7. Simplify the Expression**\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial simplification.\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100%`\n\n**8. Careful Point: Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe problem states `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. We must consider if this is the *total* or *free* (equilibrium) concentration. The total cobalt concentration (0.01 M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the ligand is in large excess, and the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to `Co²⁺` will be small compared to the total amount of `SCN⁻`. Therefore, we can safely approximate the free ligand concentration at equilibrium as the given concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` (free) ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**9. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the denominator first. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1`.\n*   `β₁ * L¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃ * L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the value of the numerator:\nNumerator = `β₂ * L² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction and the percentage:\nFraction = `Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n**10. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is approximately 16.9%. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
