    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic bromination of substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield (weight fraction) of the para-substituted product (para-isomer).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-X) based on its electronic effect (activating or deactivating) and its directing effect (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Activating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive than benzene. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating (by induction and hyperconjugation).\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating (by induction and hyperconjugation), slightly more so than methyl.\n\n*   **Deactivating, Ortho/Para-Directing Groups:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (making it less reactive) but direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating (strong inductive withdrawal) but o,p-directing (resonance donation).\n\n*   **Deactivating, Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups strongly withdraw electron density from the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester)**: Deactivating (by resonance).\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating (by induction and resonance).\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating (by resonance).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Para-Isomer Yield for Each Group**\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6):**\n    *   These substances will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the para-isomer will be extremely low, close to zero.\n    *   To order them, we consider the strength of their deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, meaning it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5):**\n    *   These substances will produce a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   The ratio of para to ortho product is determined by steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene.\n        *   Order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. This, combined with the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. The para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (often ~90% yield). This percentage is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n        *   Order: **5 < 3**.\n    *   Combining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\nThe meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields, followed by the ortho/para-directing substances.\n\n1.  Start with the meta-directors, ordered from strongest to weakest deactivator: **4 < 6 < 2**\n2.  Continue with the ortho/para-directors, ordered by their increasing preference for the para position: **< 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
