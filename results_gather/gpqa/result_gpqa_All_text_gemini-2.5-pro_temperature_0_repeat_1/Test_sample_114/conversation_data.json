    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the angle between the two photons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Physical Principles**\n\n*   **System:** An electron and a positron are moving towards each other and will annihilate.\n*   **Electron:** Moves from left to right (we'll define this as the +x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   **Positron:** Moves from right to left (the -x direction). Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n*   **Annihilation:** The collision results in two photons.\n*   **Governing Principles:** The process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (as indicated by Lorentz factors > 1), we must use the formulas from Special Relativity.\n\n**2. Calculate the Initial Energy and Momentum**\n\nWe need to find the total energy and total momentum of the electron-positron system before the collision. Let $m_e$ be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron, and $c$ be the speed of light.\n\n*   **For the Electron:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: We can find the momentum using the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$.\n        *   $(4 m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $16 (m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $(p_e c)^2 = 15 (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $p_e = \\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n    *   Since it moves in the +x direction, its momentum is $p_{e,x} = +\\sqrt{15} m_e c$.\n\n*   **For the Positron:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: Using the same relation:\n        *   $(2 m_e c^2)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $4 (m_e c^2)^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $(p_p c)^2 = 3 (m_e c^2)^2$\n        *   $p_p = \\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n    *   Since it moves in the -x direction, its momentum is $p_{p,x} = -\\sqrt{3} m_e c$.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-direction): $P_{x, initial} = p_{e,x} + p_{p,x} = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-direction): $P_{y, initial} = 0$ (since both particles move along the horizontal axis).\n\n**3. Define the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **Properties:** They have the same energy, which we'll call $E_\\gamma$. For a photon, its momentum is $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n*   **Directions:** One moves upper-right, and the other lower-right. Because the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, the final y-momenta of the two photons must cancel out. Since their energies (and thus momentum magnitudes) are equal, their angles with the x-axis must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let's call these angles $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$.\n\n*   **Total Final System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{final} = E_\\gamma + E_\\gamma = 2 E_\\gamma$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-direction): The x-component of each photon's momentum is $p_\\gamma \\cos\\theta = (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n        *   $P_{x, final} = (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta + (E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta = 2(E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-direction): The y-components are $(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta$ and $(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin(-\\theta) = -(E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta$.\n        *   $P_{y, final} = (E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta - (E_\\gamma/c)\\sin\\theta = 0$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nNow we equate the initial and final properties.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $6 m_e c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$. This is the energy of each photon.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (x-direction):**\n    *   $P_{x, initial} = P_{x, final}$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2(E_\\gamma/c)\\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Now, substitute the value of $E_\\gamma$ we just found:\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2((3 m_e c^2)/c)\\cos\\theta$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta$.\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nWe can now solve the momentum equation for the angle $\\theta$.\n\n*   Cancel the common term $m_e c$ from both sides:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n*   Isolate $\\cos\\theta$:\n    *   $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n*   Calculate the numerical value:\n    *   $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n    *   $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n    *   $\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n*   Find the angle $\\theta$:\n    *   $\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$.\n\n**6. Find the Angle Between the Photons**\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons. One photon has a direction of $\\theta$ relative to the x-axis, and the other has a direction of $-\\theta$.\n\n*   Total Angle = $\\theta - (-\\theta) = 2\\theta$.\n*   Total Angle $\\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$.\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Relativistic Formulas:** It is crucial to use relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) and momentum ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$), not classical ones.\n2.  **Momentum Direction:** The direction of motion is critical. The positron's momentum is negative because it moves in the -x direction. A mistake here would lead to an incorrect total initial momentum.\n3.  **Symmetry in Final State:** The fact that the photons have equal energy and the initial transverse (y) momentum is zero forces the final state to be symmetric. The angles must be $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$.\n4.  **Final Question:** The question asks for the angle *between* the photons ($2\\theta$), not the angle of one photon with the axis ($\\theta$). This is a common trap.\n\nBased on the analysis, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>"
