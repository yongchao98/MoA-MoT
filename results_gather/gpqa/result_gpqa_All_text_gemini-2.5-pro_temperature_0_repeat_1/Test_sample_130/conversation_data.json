    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single `1H NMR` peak at 7 ppm and two `13C NMR` peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The single `1H NMR` peak at 7 ppm indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic (alkene) protons.\n    *   The two `13C NMR` peaks correspond to the alkene carbons (~137 ppm) and the carbonyl carbons (~165 ppm). The fact that there are only two peaks indicates high symmetry, with the two alkene carbons being equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons being equivalent.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of **maleic anhydride**, which is formed by the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid).\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bond carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n*   The reaction produces two stereoisomeric products: a major and a minor product. In Diels-Alder reactions, the major product formed under kinetic control is the **endo** product, while the minor product is the **exo** product. The endo product is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3 (C9H14 from the diene + C4H2O3 from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Endo (Major) and Exo (Minor) Products**\n\n*   In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system formed, the C7 carbon (from the CH2 group of the diene) forms a one-carbon bridge.\n*   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the two protons on the carbons where the anhydride is attached (let's call them `H_anhydride`) are on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system (pointing away from the C7 bridge).\n*   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. In this conformation, the `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face of the bicyclic system (pointing towards the C7 bridge).\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY NMR to Distinguish the Isomers**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Ã…). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially close.\n*   The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the endo isomer but far apart in the exo isomer.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Spatially Close Protons in Each Isomer**\n\nLet's identify the key protons and their locations:\n*   `H_anhydride`: The two equivalent protons on the saturated part of the anhydride ring.\n*   `Me_bridgehead`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). These are on the *exo* face.\n*   `Me_vinyl`: The two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (C2 and C3). These are on the *endo* face.\n*   `H_bridge`: The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge. One is *syn* to the double bond (`H_syn`, on the *endo* face) and one is *anti* to the double bond (`H_anti`, on the *exo* face).\n\nNow, let's analyze the proximities:\n*   **In the Major (Endo) Product:**\n    *   The `H_anhydride` protons are on the *exo* face.\n    *   They are close to other protons on the *exo* face: `H_anti` and the `Me_bridgehead` groups.\n    *   They are far from protons on the *endo* face: `H_syn` and the `Me_vinyl` groups.\n*   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:**\n    *   The `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face.\n    *   They are close to other protons on the *endo* face: `H_syn` and the `Me_vinyl` groups.\n    *   They are far from protons on the *exo* face: `H_anti` and the `Me_bridgehead` groups.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be between `H_anhydride` and either `H_anti` or `Me_bridgehead`.\n\n**Step 6: Assign NMR Signals and Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's assign the signals given in the options based on typical chemical shifts:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This corresponds to the two equivalent `H_anhydride` protons, which are alpha to carbonyl groups.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This corresponds to the `Me_vinyl` groups (methyls on a double bond).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** This corresponds to the `Me_bridgehead` groups (methyls on saturated carbons, more shielded).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This corresponds to one of the C7 bridge protons (`H_syn` or `H_anti`). Given its proximity to other groups on the exo face in the major product, this is likely `H_anti`.\n\nNow, let's check the options against the expected NOE for the major product (`H_anhydride` <-> `H_anti` or `H_anhydride` <-> `Me_bridgehead`):\n\n*   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`):** This interaction is strong in the *minor* (exo) product, not the major.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (`Me_vinyl`):** These groups are on opposite faces of the molecule and would not show a strong, distinguishing NOE.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_anti`) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (`H_anhydride`):** This corresponds to the `H_anti` <-> `H_anhydride` interaction. Both protons are on the *exo* face in the major (endo) product, so they are close. In the minor (exo) product, they are on opposite faces and far apart. This perfectly matches the description.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (`Me_bridgehead`) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (`H_anti`):** Both of these are on the *exo* face in both the major and minor isomers. An NOE would be expected in both products, so it is not a distinguishing cross-peak.\n\nThe only option that describes a cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
