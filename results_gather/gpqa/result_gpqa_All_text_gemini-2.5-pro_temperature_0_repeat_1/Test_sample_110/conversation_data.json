    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone (the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The Michael donor is the ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the C=O group at C1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a proton, the base will exclusively deprotonate at this position. This forms a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The enolate formed is the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is C6.\n    *   The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The electrophilic carbon is the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n    *   After the initial addition, the resulting intermediate is protonated (e.g., during aqueous workup) to give the final product. The group added to C6 is a -CH₂CH₂COOEt (3-ethoxy-3-oxopropyl) group.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the original cyclohexanone ring with the following substituents:\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) at C1.\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C2.\n        *   A methyl group and the newly added -CH₂CH₂COOEt group at C6.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we must identify the principal functional group. The ester (-COOEt) has higher priority than the ketone (=O).\n    *   Therefore, the parent chain is the propanoate chain. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   The substituent is attached at C3 of the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. Numbering of the ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   **New C1:** The original C6, which is the point of attachment. It has a methyl group.\n        *   **New C2:** The original C1, which has the oxo (C=O) group.\n        *   **New C3:** The original C2, which has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: 3-ethyl, 1-methyl, 3-methyl, 2-oxo. Combining these gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The nitroalkane is the Michael donor, the α,β-unsaturated nitrile is the Michael acceptor, and KOH is the base.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The Michael donor is 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an α-proton from 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion), [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the CH group bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   The structure of the product is:\n        ```\n              NO₂\n              |\n        CN - CH₂ - CH - CH - CH₂ - CH₃\n                   |\n                   CH₃\n        ```\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). This carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. Thus, the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon:\n        *   C1: -CN\n        *   C2: -CH₂-\n        *   C3: -CH(CH₃)-\n        *   C4: -CH(NO₂)-\n        *   C5: -CH₂-\n        *   C6: -CH₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   B) **Correct A, Correct B**\n*   C) Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   D) Correct A, Incorrect B\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
