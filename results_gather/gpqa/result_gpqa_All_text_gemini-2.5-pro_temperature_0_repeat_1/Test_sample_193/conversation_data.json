    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\n\n*   The system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can be either +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n*   The total number of possible configurations (states) of the system is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Understand the Energy Function**\n\n*   The energy of any given state is determined by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n*   We need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states.\n\n**3. Understand the Partition Function**\n\n*   The partition function (Z) is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n*   The formula is: Z = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\n*   A more efficient way to calculate this is to find the unique energy levels and their degeneracy (how many states have that same energy). Then, Z = Σ_levels g_i * e^(-βE_i), where g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: List all possible states and calculate their energies.**\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the term `S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3` for each.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 | S1*S3 | S2*S3 | Sum (S1S2+S1S3+S2S3) | Energy E = -J * (Sum) |\n|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 |   -1  |   -1  |   +1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 |   -1  |   +1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 |   +1  |   -1  |   -1  |          -1           |           +J            |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 |   +1  |   +1  |   +1  |          +3           |          -3J            |\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice the symmetry. The energy only depends on how many spins are aligned with each other.\n\n**Step B: Group states by energy level and find their degeneracy.**\n\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1: E₁ = -3J**\n    *   This occurs when all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is **g₁ = 2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2: E₂ = +J**\n    *   This occurs when one spin is flipped relative to the other two (two are +1 and one is -1, or two are -1 and one is +1).\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1).\n    *   The degeneracy for this energy level is **g₂ = 6**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of degeneracies must equal the total number of states: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8. This confirms we have accounted for all states.\n\n**Step C: Construct the Partition Function Z.**\n\nNow, we use the formula Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂).\n\n*   For the first energy level (E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2):\n    *   The term is: 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = **2 * e^(3Jβ)**\n\n*   For the second energy level (E₂ = +J, g₂ = 6):\n    *   The term is: 6 * e^(-β * (+J)) = **6 * e^(-Jβ)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs in the exponent. The formula has a negative sign, `e^(-βE)`. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the two negatives cancel, resulting in a positive exponent `e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n**Step D: Combine the terms to get the final answer.**\n\nAdding the terms for all energy levels gives the total partition function:\n\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
