    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Mechanism Analysis**\n\n**Step I: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediate(s)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr) to form a benzyne. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C6 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  The resulting negative charge on C2 causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Careful Point:** The C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond. This is known as the kinetic isotope effect. Therefore, Pathway A (abstraction of H) is the major pathway, and Pathway B (abstraction of D) is the minor pathway. However, the question asks for *all possible* products, so we must consider the products from both intermediates.\n\n**Step II: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe second step is the addition of a nucleophile to the benzyne intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as the nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂ adds to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂ adds to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH₂ group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ attacks either C1 or C2. The resulting carbanion is protonated. In either case, the final product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**3. Summary of All Possible Products**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
