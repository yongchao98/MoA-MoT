    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final pH of the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the components and their nature.**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** A weak acid.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid):** A strong acid. It dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide):** A strong base. It dissociates completely into Ba2+ and 2 OH-.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species.**\nThe formula to calculate moles is: Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxide base, meaning each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total moles of acid and base.**\n*   Total moles of acid species = Moles of H+ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol.\n*   Total moles of base species (OH-) = 0.180 mol.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nThe strongest acid will react with the strongest base first. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid (HCl) vs. Strong Base (Ba(OH)2)**\n    *   Initial moles H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H+ from HCl is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid (CH3COOH) vs. Remaining Strong Base (OH-)**\n    *   Now, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.050 mol.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final composition and calculate the pH.**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains:\n*   Excess OH- = 0.050 mol (This is a strong base and will dominate the pH).\n*   CH3COO- (acetate ion) = 0.050 mol (This is a weak base, but its contribution to the OH- concentration is negligible compared to the excess strong base).\n*   Spectator ions: Cl- and Ba2+.\n\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-).\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question asks for pH, not pOH. Remember the relationship: pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
