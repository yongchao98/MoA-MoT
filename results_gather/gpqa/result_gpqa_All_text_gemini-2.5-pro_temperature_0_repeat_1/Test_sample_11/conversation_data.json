    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\n*   **The Process:** A stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_{\\mu}$). The reaction is: $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_{\\mu}$.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In any particle decay, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since the initial pion is stationary, this is a two-body decay from rest.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The speeds of the resulting particles are significant compared to the speed of light, so we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Assumptions**\n\n*   Initial particle: Pion ($\\pi^+$) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of muon ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest mass of neutrino ($m_{\\nu}c^2$): The neutrino's mass is extremely small and is assumed to be zero for this calculation, which is a standard approximation in this context. So, $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   The initial momentum of the system is zero because the pion is at rest ($\\vec{p}_{\\pi} = 0$).\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n    Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as $p$:\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   The initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$.\n*   Therefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2}$\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies**\n\n*   Substitute the knowns into the energy equation. Since $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$ and $m_{\\nu} = 0$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0^2}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n*   **Careful Point:** For the massless neutrino, its total energy is $E_{\\nu} = pc$. Since its rest energy is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic energy. Thus, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$.\n*   Rearrange the equation to solve for $pc$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   The $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   Now, isolate the term $pc$:\n    $2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    As established, $KE_{\\nu} = pc$. Let's plug in the mass-energy values:\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}{2 \\times 139.6 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    The total energy released in the decay is converted into the kinetic energies of the products. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n    $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = E_{initial} - E_{final\\_rest}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2 + m_{\\nu}c^2)$\n    $KE_{\\mu} + 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - (105.7 \\text{ MeV} + 0)$\n    $KE_{\\mu} + 29.8 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.8 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 4.1 \\text{ MeV}$\n    Using the more precise value for $KE_{\\nu}$:\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 29.78 \\text{ MeV} = 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) is **4.12 MeV**.\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino ($\\nu$) is **29.8 MeV**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
