    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core physical principle:** The question involves uncertainty in position (Δx) and asks for the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two relevant forms:\n    *   Position-Momentum Uncertainty: Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2\n    *   Energy-Time Uncertainty: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n\n2.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   Speed of the electron, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s.\n    *   Uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx = 0.1 nm.\n    *   We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.\n\n3.  **Formulate a plan:** We can solve this problem in two equivalent ways.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Using Position-Momentum Uncertainty.**\n        a. Use the position-momentum uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).\n        b. Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n        c. Calculate the final value for ΔE.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Energy-Time Uncertainty.**\n        a. Relate the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in time (Δt) using the electron's velocity.\n        b. Use the energy-time uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The electron's speed (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is about 2/3 the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s). At such high speeds, relativistic effects are significant. This means we must use the relativistic relationship between energy and momentum, not the classical one.\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   Classical: E = p²/2m\n    *   Relativistic: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    The derivative dE/dp gives the particle's velocity, v. For the relativistic case, dE/dp = v, which leads to the simple relationship ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All values must be in standard SI units before calculation. The position uncertainty Δx = 0.1 nm must be converted to meters (1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m).\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Minimum Uncertainty:** The uncertainty principle gives a lower bound (≥). The question asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we can use the equality for our estimation: Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ/2. For order-of-magnitude estimates, even Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ is often sufficient and won't change the final answer choice.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will use the first method (Position-Momentum).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n\nAccording to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Δx = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nΔp_min ≈ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp_min ≈ 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Step 2: Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the relationship between energy and momentum is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². To find how a small change in momentum (dp) affects energy (dE), we differentiate this equation with respect to p:\nd(E²)/dp = d((pc)² + (m₀c²)²)/dp\n2E (dE/dp) = 2pc²\ndE/dp = pc²/E\n\nIt is a known result from special relativity that pc²/E = v, the velocity of the particle. Therefore:\ndE/dp = v\n\nWe can approximate the uncertainties using this relationship:\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\nUsing the values we have:\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δp_min ≈ 0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\nΔE_min ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) × (0.527 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe estimated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
