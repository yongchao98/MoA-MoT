    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Define Mean Free Path (MFP)**\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for the mean free path is given by:\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area of the target for a collision to occur.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze λ₁, the Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n*   λ₁ represents the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   In this case, both the projectile particle and the target particles are identical gas molecules, and they are all in motion. This requires a modification to the general formula.\n*   The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule among its own kind is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)\n*   Here, `n` is the number density of the gas molecules, and `σ_gas` is the kinetic collision cross-section for two gas molecules. This cross-section is determined by the physical size of the molecules and the short-range intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze λ₂, the Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n*   λ₂ represents the mean free path of an electron from the beam as it travels through the residual gas.\n*   In this case, the projectile is an electron, and the targets are the gas molecules.\n*   Since electrons are much lighter and faster (accelerated to 1000 kV) than the gas molecules, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor is not used.\n*   The formula for the mean free path of an electron in the gas is:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n*   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before. `σ_e-gas` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gas vs. σ_e-gas)**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to compare the effective \"target size\" a gas molecule presents to another gas molecule versus the size it presents to an electron.\n\n*   **σ_gas (Gas-Gas Collision):** This interaction is governed by short-range forces. The molecules are electrically neutral overall, so they must get very close to each other to interact significantly. The cross-section is related to the physical, kinetic diameter of the molecules.\n*   **σ_e-gas (Electron-Gas Collision):** This interaction is fundamentally different. The electron is a charged particle. It interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range Coulomb force. The electron is scattered by the electric fields of both the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron cloud of the gas molecule. Because the Coulomb force has a long range, an electron can be significantly deflected (a \"collision\" or \"scattering event\") even when it passes far from the center of the gas molecule.\n\n**Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** The long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction means that the effective target area a gas molecule presents to an electron (σ_e-gas) is much larger than the kinetic target area it presents to another neutral gas molecule (σ_gas).\nTherefore, we can conclude: **σ_e-gas > σ_gas**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\nNow we can compare the two mean free paths using their formulas:\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n\nSince we established that σ_e-gas is significantly larger than σ_gas, the denominator in the expression for λ₂ (n * σ_e-gas) is larger than the denominator in the expression for λ₁ (√2 * n * σ_gas).\n\nA larger denominator results in a smaller value for the fraction. Therefore, the mean free path for the electron (λ₂) must be smaller than the mean free path for the gas molecule (λ₁).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe probability of an electron interacting with a gas molecule is higher than the probability of a gas molecule interacting with another gas molecule. A higher interaction probability (larger cross-section) leads to a shorter average distance traveled between interactions (shorter mean free path). Thus, λ₂ is shorter than λ₁.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
