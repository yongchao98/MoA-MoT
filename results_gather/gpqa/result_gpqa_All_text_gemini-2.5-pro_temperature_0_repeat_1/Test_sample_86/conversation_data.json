    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided about the compound.**\n*   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two groups attached to it.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compound contains 8 carbon atoms in total. A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the structure of the compound.**\n*   From the FTIR data, we know the two substituents are a halogen atom (-X) and a group containing a carbonyl.\n*   The halogen substituent (-X) contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only possible structure for a two-carbon group with a carbonyl is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\n*   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-C(=O)CH3.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the possible substitution patterns and their expected 1H NMR spectra.**\nThe two substituents, a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3), can be arranged in three ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n*   **Ortho (1,2-disubstituted):** This isomer would have no symmetry. All four protons on the aromatic ring would be chemically different, leading to four distinct and complex signals (multiplets) in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Meta (1,3-disubstituted):** This isomer would also have no symmetry. It would also show four distinct and complex signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Para (1,4-disubstituted):** This isomer possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the two substituents. Due to this symmetry, the four aromatic protons are divided into two chemically equivalent sets. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent. This results in a very characteristic and simple 1H NMR pattern in the aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given 1H NMR options against the deduced structure.**\nWe are looking for a spectrum that matches a haloacetophenone, most likely the para isomer, as its spectrum is simple and often appears in such problems. The spectrum should show:\n1.  Two doublets in the aromatic region (approx. 7.0-8.0 ppm), each for 2H.\n2.  A singlet for the methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent, integrating to 3H, typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The signals are in the correct chemical shift range for aromatic protons attached to a ring with two electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which is exactly what is expected for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The chemical shift is also in the correct range.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the structure of para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has incorrect chemical shifts for aromatic protons and incorrect integrations for the substituents. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The problem states the compound has 8 carbons, but a halobenzaldehyde would only have 7. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compound is para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly represents the structure, showing the characteristic para-substitution pattern on the aromatic ring and the singlet for the acetyl methyl group.\n\n<<<A>>>"
