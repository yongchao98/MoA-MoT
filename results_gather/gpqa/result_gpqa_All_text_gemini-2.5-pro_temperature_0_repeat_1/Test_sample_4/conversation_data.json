    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the normalized eigenvector.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the quantum mechanical operators**\n\nThe problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ in terms of 2x2 matrices. Let's write them down. These are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle, commonly denoted by $\\vec{S}$.\n\n*   The X-component is $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ times the Pauli matrix $\\sigma_x$.\n*   The Y-component is $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ times the Pauli matrix $\\sigma_y$.\n*   The Z-component is $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ times the Pauli matrix $\\sigma_z$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe problem states that the direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is given by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. Assuming an arbitrary direction (not just along the z-axis, so $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi=0$ or $\\phi=\\pi$. We can choose $\\phi=0$ without loss of generality, as $\\theta$ can range over the plane.\nSo, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Set up the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 5: Solve the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n$\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n\nThe unnormalized eigenvector can be written as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To make it look simpler, we can choose $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ for some normalization constant $C$. Then $b = (C \\cos(\\theta/2)) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nThe eigenvector is thus proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 6: Normalize the eigenvector**\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the inner product of the state with itself is 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\nLet $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The corresponding bra is $\\langle\\psi| = C^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$, we get:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\nWe can choose the simplest value for the constant, $C=1$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\nComparing this with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The operators $P_x, P_y, P_z$ are the spin angular momentum operators, not the Pauli matrices themselves. They differ by a factor of $\\hbar/2$.\n*   The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, which simplifies the problem by setting the y-component to zero and $\\phi=0$.\n*   The eigenvalue is given as $+\\hbar/2$. The other possible eigenvalue is $-\\hbar/2$.\n*   Using half-angle identities is a key step to simplify the relationship between the components of the eigenvector.\n*   The final eigenvector must be normalized. Eigenvectors (state vectors) are dimensionless, so options containing $\\hbar$ (like A and D) are incorrect on dimensional grounds alone.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Contains $\\hbar$, incorrect.\nB) Matches our derived result.\nC) This is a general form for a qubit, but for our specific operator with $\\phi=0$, the components are functions of $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\nD) Contains $\\hbar$ and is constant, incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
