    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nWe are given a series of reactions and properties for several unknown substances (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H).\n\n1.  **Reaction 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n2.  **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n3.  **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A(s) + F(acid, strong) + G(acid, weak)\n4.  **Reaction 4:** D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n5.  **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? The options are A) D∞h, B) C2, C) D4h, D) C2v.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Most Constraining Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 3 (Hydrolysis of C):** This is the most chemically specific clue. The reaction of C with water regenerates the solid starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).\n    *   The fact that A is reformed suggests that A is an element (likely a metal or metalloid) that is part of a complex or unstable compound C, and is released in its elemental form upon hydrolysis.\n    *   The formation of two different acids implies that the part of C that is not A (which comes from gas B) must contain at least two different non-metal elements that form acids upon hydrolysis.\n\n*   **A Plausible Chemical System for Clue 3:** A well-known reaction that fits this description is the hydrolysis of iodine trichloride (ICl₃).\n    *   5 ICl₃ + 9 H₂O → I₂(s) + 15 HCl(aq) + 3 HIO₃(aq)\n    *   In this reaction:\n        *   **A = I₂** (Iodine is a solid at standard conditions). A is reformed.\n        *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid).\n        *   **G = HIO₃** (Iodic acid is a weaker acid than HCl).\n    *   This system perfectly matches the description in Clue 3. Let's tentatively identify these substances.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Hypothesis with Other Clues**\n\nIf A = I₂, F = HCl, and G = HIO₃, then C must be an iodine chloride. The formula for iodine trichloride is ICl₃, which exists as a dimer, **I₂Cl₆**, a bright yellow solid. We will assume \"bright red\" is a slight inaccuracy or refers to a similar compound, and proceed with C = I₂Cl₆.\n\n*   **Clue 1 (Formation of C):** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C\n    *   I₂(s) + B(g) → I₂Cl₆(s)\n    *   The balanced reaction is I₂(s) + 3 Cl₂(g) → I₂Cl₆(s).\n    *   This implies that **B = Cl₂** (Chlorine gas).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The stoichiometry in the problem is 1:8, while the reaction requires a 1:3 ratio. This is a significant discrepancy. In such puzzles, sometimes the numbers are incorrect or refer to something non-obvious. We will note this discrepancy but continue, as the chemical fit of the hydrolysis reaction is very strong.\n\n*   **Clue 4 (Formation of H):** D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1)\n    *   D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)\n    *   There are two common reactions that fit this pattern:\n        *   CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l) (Phosgene, a solvent and reagent).\n        *   SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l) (Sulfuryl chloride, a solvent and reagent).\n    *   So, D is either CO or SO₂.\n\n*   **Clue 2 (Formation of E):** C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)\n    *   We need to test both possibilities for D.\n    *   **Case 1: D = CO.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 CO → E. This reaction is not standard and is unlikely to produce a single, well-known hazardous product.\n    *   **Case 2: D = SO₂.** The reaction is I₂Cl₆ + 2 SO₂ → E. I₂Cl₆ (or ICl₃) is a strong oxidizing agent. SO₂ is a reducing agent. However, the reaction 2ICl₃ + 2SO₂ → I₂ + 2SO₂Cl₂ produces two products, not a single product E.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluation and Alternative Hypotheses**\n\nThe I₂/ICl₃ hypothesis, while fitting Clue 3 perfectly, runs into significant problems with stoichiometry and the reaction to form E. Let's consider another approach, starting from the possible answers for the symmetry of E.\n\n*   The option **D4h** corresponds to a square planar geometry. The most famous example of a simple, neutral, extremely hazardous molecule with D4h symmetry is **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**.\n*   Let's assume **E = XeF₄**.\n    *   **Clue 2:** C + 2 D(g) → XeF₄. The most direct synthesis is Xe(g) + 2 F₂(g) → XeF₄(s). This would imply **C = Xe** and **D = F₂**.\n    *   **Let's test this:**\n        *   **Clue 1:** A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(Xe). This reaction to produce Xenon from a solid A is highly exotic (nuclear or decomposition of a complex compound). Also, C is described as a \"bright red product,\" whereas Xenon is a colorless gas. This is a major contradiction.\n        *   **Clue 3:** C(Xe) + H₂O → A(s) + F(strong) + G(weak). Xenon does not react with water to produce acids and a solid. This is a fatal flaw in the hypothesis.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion Path**\n\nBoth of the most promising chemical pathways lead to contradictions, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. This suggests either the problem statement is flawed, or it relies on very obscure chemistry. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\n*   The hydrolysis reaction (Clue 3) has a near-perfect chemical match with the iodine chloride system. The issues with this path are stoichiometry and the final reaction to make E.\n*   The final product properties (hazardous, D4h symmetry) have a near-perfect match with XeF₄. The issues with this path are the formation and reaction properties of C.\n\nIn such puzzles, the question being asked is often the most reliable clue. The question is about the **molecular symmetry of E**. The D4h option points strongly to XeF₄. It is plausible that the puzzle was constructed around this specific molecule, and the other clues were created to be challenging, even to the point of being slightly inconsistent. Given that XeF₄ is the canonical example of a hazardous D4h molecule, it is the most probable intended identity for E.\n\nTherefore, assuming E is XeF₄, its molecular symmetry group is D4h.\n\nFinal check of the geometry of XeF₄:\n*   Xenon is the central atom.\n*   It has 4 bonding pairs (to F) and 2 lone pairs.\n*   VSEPR theory predicts an octahedral arrangement of electron pairs.\n*   To minimize repulsion, the two lone pairs occupy opposite (axial) positions, forcing the four fluorine atoms into a square planar arrangement in the equatorial plane.\n*   This geometry belongs to the D4h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
