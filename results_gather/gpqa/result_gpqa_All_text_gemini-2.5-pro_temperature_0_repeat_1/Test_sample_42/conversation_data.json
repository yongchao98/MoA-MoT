    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the description and draw the structure.**\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Functional Group:** The description includes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid is the highest priority group. Therefore, the parent name of the molecule will be **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n3.  **Place Substituents Relative to C1:**\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is *para* to the carboxylic acid. This places the -OCH3 group at C4.\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A carbaldehyde group (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are *meta* to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C3 and C5.\n4.  **Use Additional Constraints to Finalize the Structure:**\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are *meta* to each other. Placing one at C3 and the other at C5 satisfies this condition.\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3 at C4) and the hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the cyano group (-CN). This is the key constraint to determine the exact arrangement.\n        *   Let's assume the cyano group (-CN) is at C3. For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho, this is correct. For the hydroxyl group (-OH) to be ortho to the cyano group at C3, the -OH must be at C2.\n        *   This placement forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the carbaldehyde group to be at C5.\n5.  **Final Structure:**\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxyl)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the correct IUPAC numbering.**\n\n1.  The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1.\n2.  We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (positions) to the other substituents.\n3.  Let's try numbering clockwise: The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n4.  Let's try numbering counter-clockwise: The substituents would be at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n5.  Since both numbering directions result in the same locant set, we must use a tie-breaker rule: the substituent that comes first alphabetically gets the lower number.\n6.  Let's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n7.  The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n    *   In our drawn structure (which corresponds to clockwise numbering from C1), the cyano group is at C3.\n    *   If we were to number counter-clockwise, the cyano group would be at C5.\n8.  Since 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering is correct. The positions are as determined in Step 1.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the final name.**\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid\n2.  **Substituents with Locants:**\n    *   at C2: hydroxy\n    *   at C3: cyano\n    *   at C4: methoxy\n    *   at C5: formyl\n    *   at C6: dimethylamino\n3.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:** List the substituents in alphabetical order before the parent name.\n    *   3-**c**yano\n    *   6-**d**imethylamino (Note: parentheses are used for complex substituents like this)\n    *   5-**f**ormyl\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy\n4.  **Combine to form the full name:**\n    3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and not alphabetized.\n*   C) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Correct numbering, but substituents are not listed in alphabetical order.\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This matches our derived name perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
