    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which can be written as L₁ / L₂.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  or  R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    *   M₁ = 1.5 * M₂ (This information is not directly needed for the luminosity calculation but is part of the problem description).\n*   **Peak Wavelengths:** The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same.\n    *   λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2\n*   **Black Body Radiation:** Both stars are assumed to radiate as perfect black bodies.\n*   **Radial Velocities:**\n    *   Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s (at rest relative to the observer).\n    *   Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s (moving away from the observer, causing a redshift).\n\n**3. Identify Relevant Physical Principles and Formulas**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law describes the total power (luminosity) radiated by a black body. The formula is:\n    *   L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    *   Where L is luminosity, R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the surface temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (the peak wavelength). This peak wavelength is the *emitted* wavelength, not the observed one.\n    *   λ_em * T = b\n    *   Where λ_em is the emitted peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and b is Wien's constant. This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_em (T ∝ 1/λ_em).\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This describes how the observed wavelength of light changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.\n    *   λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r / c)\n    *   Where λ_obs is the observed wavelength, λ_em is the emitted wavelength, v_r is the radial velocity, and c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁵ km/s or 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Set up the luminosity ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂).**\n    From Wien's Law, temperature is inversely proportional to the *emitted* peak wavelength (T = b / λ_em). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = (b / λ_em,1) / (b / λ_em,2) = λ_em,2 / λ_em,1\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate emitted wavelengths to observed wavelengths using the Doppler effect.**\n    The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2). We need to find the relationship between the *emitted* wavelengths.\n    *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0. So, λ_obs,1 = λ_em,1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_em,1.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. So, λ_obs,2 = λ_em,2 * (1 + v_r2/c).\n    Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set the two expressions equal:\n    λ_em,1 = λ_em,2 * (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio of emitted wavelengths.**\n    From the equation in Step 3, we can find the ratio λ_em,2 / λ_em,1, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_em,2 / λ_em,1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n\n*   **Step 5: Substitute the wavelength ratio into the temperature ratio.**\n    From Step 2, T₁/T₂ = λ_em,2 / λ_em,1. So:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)\n    This shows that Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2. This makes sense: for Star_2's light to be redshifted to the same observed wavelength as Star_1, it must have started at a shorter (bluer) wavelength, which corresponds to a higher temperature.\n\n*   **Step 6: Combine everything and calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\n    Substitute the known ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio formula from Step 1:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r2/c)]⁴\n\n*   **Step 7: Plug in the numerical values.**\n    *   R₁ / R₂ = 1.5  => (1.5)² = 2.25\n    *   v_r2 = 700 km/s\n    *   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n    *   v_r2 / c = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 ≈ 0.002333\n    Now, calculate the ratio:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009355...\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n*   **Step 8: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value of ~2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
