    "An analysis of the question and the provided options is performed step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of optical isomerism.**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like restricted rotation in certain molecules (axial chirality) or specific planar structures (planar chirality), as long as the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, meaning two benzene rings are connected by a single C-C bond. The name indicates the following substituents:\n    *   Two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   Two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is hindered. This steric hindrance can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar. The resulting twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We need to check for the presence of a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Thus, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. Its structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We need to check for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two identical phenyl groups (C6H5). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Geometric vs. Optical Isomerism and Symmetry):** This molecule is a geometric isomer (*trans*). We need to determine if it is also optically active. We must check for symmetry elements.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
