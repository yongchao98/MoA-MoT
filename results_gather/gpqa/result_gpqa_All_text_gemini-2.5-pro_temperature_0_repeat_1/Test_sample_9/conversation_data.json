    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of density and its relation to planetary mass and composition.**\n*   **Density** is defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V).\n*   For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n*   A key principle for planets with similar compositions is **gravitational compression**. As a planet's mass increases, its gravitational pull becomes stronger. This stronger gravity compresses the materials the planet is made of, squeezing them into a smaller volume than they would otherwise occupy. This compression leads to an increase in overall density.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each option based on this principle.**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This is our baseline, representing Earth itself.\n    *   Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.**\n    *   The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   This is essentially the same as Earth's density. (Note: For a planet with twice Earth's mass to have the same density, its composition would have to be of lighter elements than Earth's, but we only need to consider the value given).\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   This planet is a \"Super-Earth\".\n    *   It has the **same composition** as Earth, meaning it's made of the same ratio of iron, silicates, etc.\n    *   Because it is 5 times more massive, its internal gravity is much stronger.\n    *   This stronger gravity will cause significant **gravitational compression**, squeezing the materials more tightly than in Earth.\n    *   Therefore, its density will be **higher** than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This planet is a \"sub-Earth\".\n    *   It has the **same composition** as Earth.\n    *   Because it is less massive, its internal gravity is weaker.\n    *   This weaker gravity will result in **less compression** of its materials compared to Earth.\n    *   Therefore, its density will be **lower** than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the densities of all options.**\n\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to high mass and compression)\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to low mass and less compression)\n\n**Step 4: Conclude which planet has the highest density.**\n\nComparing the results, the planet in option (c) is the only one with a density definitively greater than Earth's. The planets in options (a) and (b) have densities approximately equal to Earth's, and the planet in option (d) has a density lower than Earth's.\n\nTherefore, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass has the highest density. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
