    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting material.**\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\nLet's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This indicates a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde), which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\nLet's count them for the starting material:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of π bonds:\n    *   1 from the C=C in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 from the C=C in the vinyl group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 from the C=O in the formyl group.\n    *   Total π bonds = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the IHD of the starting material is:\nIHD (start) = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and the reagent.**\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**.\nThis combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes. The oxygen atoms are removed.\n    *   -CHO (formyl group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n    *   -COOH (carboxylic acid group) is reduced to -CH3 (methyl group).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C) by adding hydrogen across them.\n*   It does not break stable ring structures like cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product and its IHD.**\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the starting material:\n*   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=O bond in the formyl group will be reduced (and the oxygen removed).\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced (and both oxygens removed).\n\nEssentially, all the π bonds in the molecule are eliminated by the reduction. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the ring structure itself, as the cyclohexane ring is not opened by this reagent.\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the final product.**\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings in product) + (Number of π bonds in product)\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains)\n*   Number of π bonds = 0 (all C=C and C=O bonds are reduced)\n\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe final product is a substituted alkane with a single ring, so its index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Starting Material: C10H12O3. IHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5. Correct.\n*   Product: All functional groups and double bonds are reduced. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   IHD of Product: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1. The calculation confirms the result.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
