    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**\nThe problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax (`plx`). The mathematical relationship is given as:\n`N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx^(-5)`\nHere, `N` represents the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value `plx`. This is equivalent to counting all stars within a certain distance.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Parallax to Distance**\nParallax (`plx`) is the primary method for measuring the distance to nearby stars. The relationship between parallax and distance (`r`) is inversely proportional:\n`plx ∝ 1/r`\nThis means that a larger distance corresponds to a smaller parallax, and vice versa. For our analysis, we can write `r = 1/plx`.\n\n**Step 3: Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance**\nWe want to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, not parallax `plx`. We can substitute the relationship from Step 2 into the equation from Step 1.\nGiven: `N ∝ plx^(-5)`\nSubstitute `plx = 1/r`:\n`N ∝ (1/r)^(-5)`\n`N ∝ r^5`\nThis equation tells us that the total (cumulative) number of stars within a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Distance**\nThe question asks for how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is asking for the density of stars at a given distance, not the cumulative total. In mathematical terms, this is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of `N` with respect to `r`, or `dN/dr`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Derivative**\nWe have the proportionality `N ∝ r^5`. Let's write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`:\n`N = k * r^5`\nNow, we take the derivative with respect to `r`:\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\nUsing the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n`dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n`dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n**Step 6: Find the Final Proportionality**\nFrom the result in Step 5, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r^4`:\n`dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Cumulative vs. Differential Count:** It is crucial to understand that the initial information (`N ~ 1/plx^5`) refers to a cumulative count of stars up to a certain distance (or down to a certain parallax). The question asks for a differential count (number of stars *per unit distance*), which requires taking a derivative.\n2.  **Parallax-Distance Relationship:** The inverse relationship `plx ∝ 1/r` is fundamental to solving the problem.\n3.  **Power Rule:** Correctly applying the power rule for differentiation is the key mathematical step.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the fourth power of the distance, `r^4`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
