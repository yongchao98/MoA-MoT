    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (DBE=4) and one additional double bond or ring (DBE=1). The presence of an oxygen atom suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with the -CH₂-CHO fragment, where the methylene protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is appropriate for a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (less than 7.0 ppm), which suggests the ring is substituted with an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CHO, -CH₂-, a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, and -NH₂), we can assemble the structure. The -CH₂-CHO group and the -NH₂ group are the two substituents on the benzene ring in a para arrangement.\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + C₂H₃O (-CH₂CHO) + NH₂ = C₈H₉NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   Intermediate 1: **2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride**\n\n2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water (usually with gentle heating). This is a **hydrolysis** reaction where the diazonium group, an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas), is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Intermediate 2: **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde with two acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl). Aldehydes with α-protons undergo a **self-aldol condensation** in the presence of base and heat.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product of the aldol condensation.**\n\nThe reaction is a self-condensation of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde.\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form the aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n4.  **Dehydration:** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-proton (at C-2) is removed, and the -OH group on the β-carbon (C-3) leaves. This forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nLet's trace the structure of the final condensation product:\n*   The main chain is a butanal skeleton.\n*   Dehydration creates a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n*   The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after the complete aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration). This is the expected final product under heating conditions.\n*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and double bond position.\n*   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; would result from a different reaction.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. Given the \"Heat\" condition, it will dehydrate to form the final condensation product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
