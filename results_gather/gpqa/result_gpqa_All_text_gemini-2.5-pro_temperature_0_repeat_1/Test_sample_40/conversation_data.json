    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup and Frames of Reference**\n\n*   We have two frames of reference:\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the frame of the observer, who is at rest. In this frame, the glass is moving.\n    *   **The Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame moving along with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n**2. Identify the Velocities**\n\n*   **v:** The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam. Let's define this direction as the positive x-axis. So, the velocity of S' relative to S is `v`.\n*   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame, is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is also in the positive direction.\n*   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n\n*   The problem involves speeds that can be close to the speed of light, so we must use the Einstein (relativistic) velocity addition formula, not the classical Galilean one.\n*   The formula for adding velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n\n*   We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n*   Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\n*   First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n*   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n*   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: `n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v`\n    *   Denominator: `n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v`\n*   So, the final expression for `u` is:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n*   Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n*   Our result matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Choice of Formula:** It is crucial to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, as classical (Galilean) addition (`u = u' + v = 1/n + v`) would be incorrect.\n2.  **Definition of u':** The speed of light in the medium, `c/n` (or `1/n` here), is its speed *in the rest frame of that medium*. This is `u'`, not `u`.\n3.  **Signs of Velocities:** The glass and the light beam are moving in the same direction. Therefore, both `v` and `u'` should have the same sign in the formula. We chose positive for both. If they were moving in opposite directions, one would be negative.\n4.  **Value of c:** The problem simplifies the calculation by setting `c=1`. Remember to use this value consistently.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification:** Be careful when simplifying the complex fraction. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` is a clean way to do this.\n\n<<<A>>>"
