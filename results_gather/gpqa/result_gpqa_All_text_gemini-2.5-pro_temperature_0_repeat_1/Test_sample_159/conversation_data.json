    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided regular polygon. A key piece of information is that all its apothems have the same length, 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides. For a regular polygon, all apothems are indeed equal. The apothem is also the radius of the inscribed circle of the polygon.\n\nThe problem asks us to consider the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases infinitely, while keeping the apothem constant, the polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The radius of this limiting circle will be equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the limiting shape. An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a' as N → ∞. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Theory of Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\nWhen a monochromatic plane wave of light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far field known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe intensity distribution I(θ) as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin θ) / (k * a * sin θ)]²\n\nWhere:\n*   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   k = 2π/λ is the wave number.\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (the dark rings) occur at angles θ where the intensity I(θ) is zero. This happens when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sin θ) = 0.\n\nThe minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x). We need to find the angular positions corresponding to the first two zeros (excluding the trivial zero at x=0, which corresponds to the central maximum).\n\nThe first few zeros of J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   First zero (for the first minimum): x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second zero (for the second minimum): x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Angular Position of the First Minimum (θ₁)**\nThe first minimum occurs when:\nk * a * sin θ₁ = x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n\nSubstituting k = 2π/λ:\n(2π/λ) * a * sin θ₁ ≈ 3.8317\n\nThe problem states we can use the small angle approximation (tan θ ≈ θ, which also implies sin θ ≈ θ for small angles).\n(2π/λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317\n\nSolving for θ₁:\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)\nθ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This value, approximately 0.610 λ/a, corresponds to option A. However, this is the position of the *first* minimum, not the distance between the first two minima.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂)**\nThe second minimum occurs when:\nk * a * sin θ₂ = x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nUsing the same substitutions and approximations:\n(2π/λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nSolving for θ₂:\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)\nθ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.6098 * (λ / a)]\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The final calculation requires subtracting the angular position of the first minimum from that of the second minimum. It is a common mistake to report only the position of the first minimum or the diameter of the central disk.\n\n**Step 7: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\nOur calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a).\nLet's compare this with the options provided:\nA) 0.610 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value 0.5068 * (λ / a) is best matched by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
