    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System and Key Principles:**\n    *   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This is the most crucial point. No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers. In this case, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number `n` (for the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (spin up or spin down).\n    *   **Energy Levels:** For a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are given by:\n        $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    *   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n        *   and so on.\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (spin up, $m_s = +1/2$ and spin down, $m_s = -1/2$), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** fermions.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    *   To find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We can place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   All four particles are now placed in the lowest possible energy configuration.\n    *   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the occupied single-particle states:\n        $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n        $E_{ground} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n3.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n    *   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2 (Energy 4E).\n    *   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3 (Energy 9E).\n    *   We move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n        *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy E)\n        *   One particle in n=2 (Energy 4E)\n        *   One particle in n=3 (Energy 9E)\n    *   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n        $E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy increase.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n    *   **First Excitation (already found):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy cost is $E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E$. Total energy is $10E + 5E = 15E$.\n    *   **Consider other excitations:**\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from a lower level. Move a particle from n=1 to the lowest empty level, n=3. The energy cost is $E_3 - E_1 = 9E - E = 8E$. The total energy would be $10E + 8E = 18E$. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote a particle to a higher level. Move a particle from n=2 to n=4. The energy cost is $E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E$. The total energy would be $10E + 12E = 22E$.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote two particles. For example, move both particles from n=2 to n=3. The energy cost is $2 \\times (E_3 - E_2) = 2 \\times 5E = 10E$. The total energy would be $10E + 10E = 20E$.\n    *   Comparing the possible total energies above the ground state: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...\n    *   The lowest is 15E (the first excited state).\n    *   The next lowest is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
