    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5.\n    *   The carbon at position 5 is a chiral center with an (S) configuration. This means the starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH, LiAlH4), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The reagent itself is achiral.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This non-selective attack on the C3 carbonyl will produce both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged (it keeps its S configuration).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols. The reagent is achiral.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of both ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, this pair of enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: the (R,R) enantiomer, the (S,S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and **will be separated** from the enantiomeric pair's peak.\n    *   This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are structurally very different (different molecular formulas and weights) and will be easily separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1, will be separated)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3, will be separated by the chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 & 4, will be separated)\n*   Since all five compounds are unique stereoisomers, a chiral column is capable of resolving all of them.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
