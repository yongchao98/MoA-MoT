    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial and final states and extract given values.**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   The nucleus splits into nothing else, so energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We designate $m_1$ as the more massive fragment.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the rest masses (and rest energies) of the two fragments.**\n\n1.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n3.  Now find $m_1$:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n4.  Calculate their rest energies using the initial rest energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   Rest energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy.\n*   $Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final total rest energy})$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Conservation of Momentum.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so its momentum was zero.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$) using the classical approximation.**\n\n1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n2.  Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$):\n    *   $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n3.  The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n4.  This gives us the relation $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n5.  Using the total kinetic energy, $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$).**\n\n1.  We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n2.  Rearranging for momentum, and using the total energy $E = T + m_0c^2$, we get:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n3.  Since momentum is conserved ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\n4.  Substitute the known values: $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$, and $T_2 = 3 - T_1$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$.\n5.  Simplify the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n    *   $396T_1 = -204T_1 + 603$.\n    *   $600T_1 = 603$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{correct}} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the difference and convert units.**\n\n1.  The difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n2.  Convert the result from GeV to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The phrase \"2 times more massive\" was interpreted as $m_1 = 2m_2$, which is standard in physics problems and leads to a valid answer choice.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both energy and momentum conservation were correctly applied.\n*   **Formulas:** The distinct formulas for kinetic energy and its relation to momentum in classical vs. relativistic mechanics were used.\n*   **Units:** All calculations were performed consistently in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV as required by the answer options.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
