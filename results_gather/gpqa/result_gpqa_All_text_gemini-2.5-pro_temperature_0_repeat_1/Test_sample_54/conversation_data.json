    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the number of signals and their integrations.**\nThe spectrum shows four distinct signals, which means there are four chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n*   Signal at 7.0 ppm: 1H (one proton)\n*   Signal at 5.5 ppm: 1H (one proton)\n*   Signal at 2.1 ppm: 3H (three protons, likely a methyl group)\n*   Signal at 1.6 ppm: 3H (three protons, likely a methyl group)\nThe total number of protons is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nLet's check the molecular formulas of the options:\n*   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): 3 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from CH) + 3 (from acetate CH3) = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): This would have 10 protons. This does not match the integration data.\nTherefore, we can immediately eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the chemical shifts and multiplicities of each signal.**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the acetyl methyl group present in all propenyl acetate options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond (C=C-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with a -CH=CH-CH3 structure, where the methyl group is split by the adjacent vinylic proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal is the methyl group of the propenyl chain.\n\n*   **Signal 3 & 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** Both signals are in the vinylic region (4.5-7.5 ppm), confirming they are protons on a C=C double bond. The proton at 7.0 ppm is more deshielded, likely because it is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom (O-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity of 7.0 ppm signal (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton. This would be the other vinylic proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity of 5.5 ppm signal (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. The \"d\" (doublet) comes from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm). The \"q\" (quartet) comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm), following the n+1 rule (3+1=4 lines, a quartet).\n    *   **Conclusion:** These two signals represent the two protons on the double bond in the structure -O-CH=CH-CH3.\n\n**Step 3: Use the coupling constant (J) to determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans).**\nThe most critical piece of information for distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   For vinylic protons:\n    *   A **trans** coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   A **cis** coupling constant (³J_cis) is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe data indicates an acetate group (2.1 ppm, s), a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), and a trans geometry for the double bond (J = 16.0 Hz). This perfectly matches the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
