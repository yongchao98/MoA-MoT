    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a type of lactone (a cyclic ester). The specific name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   A \"pyran-2-one\" ring is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (at position 1) and a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds in the ring).\n*   \"4-ethyl\" means there is an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) at position 4 of the ring.\n*   The molecule has a chiral center at C4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. The reactions specify the stereochemistry as (R) for the first reaction and (S) for the second.\n\nA lactone like this is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. Specifically, a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone) is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The linear precursor to 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2OH`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's decode this name to determine the structure.\n\n*   \"Pentanoic acid\" indicates a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n*   \"3-ethyl\" means an ethyl group is at C3.\n*   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\" describes a substituent at C5. This is an isobutyl ester group, `-C(=O)O-iBu`.\n*   Combining these pieces, the structure is: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`.\n*   This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It has a chiral center at C3, the carbon with the ethyl group.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Structural Mismatch and Correction**\nThere is a discrepancy. The starting material has the ethyl group at C3, which would lead to a `3-ethyl` lactone. The product is named as a `4-ethyl` lactone. This is a very common type of typo in chemistry problems. The most logical assumption is that the product name has a typo and should be **3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. With this correction, the carbon skeleton of the starting material matches that of the product, and the problem becomes a test of reagent selectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting Material A)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Reagent Selectivity of LiBH₄.** LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent. It is strong enough to reduce esters to primary alcohols, but it does *not* reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Stereochemistry.** The reduction and cyclization reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting Material B)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-3-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Reagent Selectivity of BH₃.** Borane is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it does *not* typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) at C1 of the starting material to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate (`HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`).\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Stereochemistry.** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting Material A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
