    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics and Mathematics of Radioactive Decay:**\n    *   Radioactive decay is a random process. The probability of a single atom decaying does not depend on its age. This is known as the **memoryless property**.\n    *   This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n    *   The problem is mathematically described by the exponential decay law. The probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n    *   Using the formula: `P(decay, 100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   This equation relates the decay constant `λ` to the given time and probability. We don't necessarily need to solve for `λ` itself, but we can use this relationship.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question Mathematically:**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n    *   Because of the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a newly observed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n    *   So, we need to calculate `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use the information from Step 2: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n    *   Let's use the rules of exponents to relate the two expressions:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * (150/100)) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(1.5)`.\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found in Step 2:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Let's calculate `(0.68)^1.5`:\n        `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   This value, `0.5607`, is the probability that the atom will *survive* for 150 minutes.\n    *   The probability that it will *decay* in 150 minutes is:\n        `P(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is 43.93%.\n    *   Looking at the given options:\n        A) 48%\n        B) 44%\n        C) 40%\n        D) 52%\n    *   The value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical concept. Forgetting this would lead to a much more complicated (and incorrect) conditional probability calculation. The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information designed to test this understanding.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (`1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`e^(-λt)`). The initial information is about decay, and the final calculation requires finding the decay probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation is made simpler by manipulating the exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating `λ`, which would involve logarithms and could introduce rounding errors.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Probability of survival for 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n2.  Let S(t) be the survival probability for time t. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n3.  We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of decay, this is simply the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - S(150).\n4.  S(t) = e^(-λt). Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (S(100))^1.5.\n5.  S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n6.  Probability of decay in 150 minutes = 1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.\n7.  0.4393 is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
