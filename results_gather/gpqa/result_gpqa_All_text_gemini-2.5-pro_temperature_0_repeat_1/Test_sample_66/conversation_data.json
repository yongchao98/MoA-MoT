    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, both in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The system is described in the coupled basis, where the individual angular momenta are combined to form a total angular momentum.\n    *   The specific state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and the Final State:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   This measurement projects the system onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by kets of the form $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$, so getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$, so getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the specific final state we are interested in is $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   A crucial principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   This is expressed by the relation: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   This relation must hold for any component of the coupled state when expressed in the uncoupled basis. In other words, a coupled state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of only those uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ for which $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   For the **initial state** $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total z-component quantum number is $m_{initial} = -1$.\n    *   For the **desired final state** $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The probability of finding the system in the final state after the measurement is the squared magnitude of the inner product (projection) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    *   Probability $P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case, $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m>$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2>$). The connection between them is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **Conservation of $m$:** The most direct way to solve this problem is to recognize the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$. Since these eigenvalues are different, the states are orthogonal, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is zero.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** A measurement cannot change the value of a conserved quantity. Since the system is in a state with a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$, any measurement of the individual components must yield a pair $(m_1, m_2)$ such that their sum is $-1$. The outcome $(m_1=-1, m_2=-1)$ has a sum of $-2$, which is physically impossible for this initial state.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum quantum number $m = -1$. The measurement outcome being considered corresponds to a state with individual quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which gives a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since the total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved ($m_{initial} = m_{final}$), the probability of this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
