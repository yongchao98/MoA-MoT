    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Understanding the Core Concept: The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe impulse approximation is a fundamental tool in nuclear and particle physics for describing the scattering of a probe (like an electron or neutrino) from a composite target (like a nucleus). The core idea is to simplify a complex many-body interaction into a more manageable form. The name \"impulse\" comes from the physical picture that the interaction happens so quickly that the target particle doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors. It receives an \"impulse\" and behaves, for that brief moment, as if it were free.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Statement**\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the most fundamental assumption. It posits that the total interaction with the nucleus can be treated as an incoherent sum of interactions with each of the constituent nucleons. This allows us to write the total interaction operator as a sum of single-nucleon operators. It explicitly neglects more complex interactions, such as \"meson-exchange currents\" (MEC), where the probe interacts with the virtual particles (mesons) being exchanged between nucleons, or any other two-body (or many-body) current effects.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the starting point for simplifying the many-body problem into a set of one-body problems.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a core assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This assumption deals with what happens to the probe and the struck nucleon *before* and *after* the primary interaction. It assumes that the incoming probe interacts with only one nucleon and that the outgoing probe and the struck nucleon leave the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining \"spectator\" nucleons. This is known as neglecting \"Final State Interactions\" (FSI) and \"Initial State Interactions\" (ISI).\n    *   **Careful Point:** In reality, the nucleus is not perfectly transparent, and FSIs are an important correction to the simple impulse approximation, especially at lower energies. However, for the approximation itself to hold in its simplest form, this transparency is assumed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a core assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing the behavior of its constituent quarks. The impulse approximation, as it is typically applied in many-body nuclear physics, treats nucleons (protons and neutrons) as the fundamental degrees of freedom. It does not generally make assumptions about the sub-nucleon level (quarks and gluons).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question of whether quarks are relativistic is a matter for models of nucleon structure (like the MIT Bag Model or other quark models) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It is a separate layer of approximation from the impulse approximation, which deals with the behavior of nucleons within a nucleus.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is **not** an assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the essence of the \"impulse\" idea and the \"free nucleon\" behavior. It assumes that the interaction time is much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus. Therefore, during the brief moment of the collision, the potential energy from the binding forces of surrounding nucleons is negligible compared to the energy transferred. This allows the calculation to use the properties of a free nucleon (e.g., its mass and electromagnetic form factors) for the struck nucleon.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The nucleon is not truly free; it has a specific momentum distribution within the nucleus before the collision. The impulse approximation accounts for this initial state momentum but treats the interaction vertex itself as if the nucleon were free and on-shell.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a core assumption of the impulse approximation.\n\n**Final Synthesis**\n\nThe impulse approximation is defined by a set of simplifying assumptions that allow us to treat a complex nuclear interaction as a sum of simpler, free-nucleon interactions. Based on the analysis:\n*   Assumption 1 is essential (defines the one-body nature of the interaction).\n*   Assumption 2 is essential (neglects initial/final state interactions).\n*   Assumption 4 is essential (treats the nucleon as free *during* the interaction).\n*   Assumption 3 is not relevant to the impulse approximation at the nucleon level.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
