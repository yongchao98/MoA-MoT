    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2 and find the ratio between them to select the better observation target.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `Probability (P_transit) = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Relate the Semi-Major Axis (`a`) to Known Quantities:** We are not given the semi-major axis (`a`) directly. However, we are given the orbital period (`P`) and the stellar mass (`M_s`). We can use Kepler's Third Law to connect these variables.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law: `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n        *   `a³ ∝ P² * M_s`\n        *   `a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Create a Proportionality for Transit Probability:** Now, substitute the expression for `a` back into the transit probability formula.\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_s / a`\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_s / (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n    *   This can be rewritten as: `P_transit ∝ R_s * P^(-2/3) * M_s^(-1/3)`\n\n5.  **List the Given Information and Relationships:**\n    *   **Stellar Radii:** The host stars have the same radii. `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n    *   **Stellar Masses:** The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the star hosting Planet_2. `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    *   **Orbital Periods:** The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. `P_1 = P_2 / 3`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Information about the planets' masses being equal is not needed for this specific calculation, as the planet's mass is negligible in Kepler's Third Law and does not appear in the geometric transit probability formula.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to find the ratio `P_transit,1 / P_transit,2`.\n    *   `Ratio = (R_s1 * P_1^(-2/3) * M_s1^(-1/3)) / (R_s2 * P_2^(-2/3) * M_s2^(-1/3))`\n    *   We can group the terms: `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Known Relationships into the Ratio Formula:**\n    *   `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n    *   `P_1 / P_2 = (P_2 / 3) / P_2 = 1/3`\n    *   `M_s1 / M_s2 = (2 * M_s2) / M_s2 = 2`\n    *   Now, plug these values in: `Ratio = (1) * (1/3)^(-2/3) * (2)^(-1/3)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Remember the rules of exponents: `(x/y)^(-n) = (y/x)^n` and `x^(-n) = 1/x^n`.\n    *   `(1/3)^(-2/3) = (3/1)^(2/3) = 3^(2/3)`\n    *   `(2)^(-1/3) = 1 / 2^(1/3)`\n    *   So, `Ratio = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   `3^(2/3)` is the cube root of `3²`, which is the cube root of 9. `(9)^(1/3) ≈ 2.08`.\n    *   `2^(1/3)` is the cube root of 2. `(2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.26`.\n    *   Alternatively, we can combine the terms under the cube root: `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`.\n    *   Calculating the cube root of 4.5: `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096...`\n    *   Therefore, the ratio is approximately **1.65**.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n    *   The ratio `P_transit,1 / P_transit,2 ≈ 1.65`.\n    *   This means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting.\n    *   Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
