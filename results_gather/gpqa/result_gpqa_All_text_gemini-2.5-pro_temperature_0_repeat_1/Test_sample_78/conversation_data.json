    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product's Structure from the NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra of the product formed from the reaction of Compound X. We must first deduce the structure of this product. The molecular formula is C11H12O.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in a ketone or aldehyde.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C):** These six signals are in the aromatic/alkene region (100-150 ppm). The presence of two signals corresponding to two carbons each (126.9 and 129.1) strongly suggests a symmetrically substituted benzene ring, most likely para-substituted.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C) and δ 28.4 (1C):** These are in the aliphatic region. δ 21.3 is typical for a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (like in toluene). δ 28.4 is consistent with a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** A singlet for 3 protons is a methyl group with no adjacent protons. Its chemical shift is consistent with a methyl group on a benzene ring. This confirms the presence of a para-substituted tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-).\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** Another methyl singlet. Its chemical shift is consistent with a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (CH₃-CO-), confirming the presence of an acetyl group. This aligns with the ketone signal in the ¹³C NMR.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These two signals are doublets, each for one proton, in the vinylic region. This indicates a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-), where the two protons are coupled to each other.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A para-tolyl group (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-)\n    2.  An acetyl group (CH₃-CO-)\n    3.  A vinylene group (-CH=CH-)\n\n    Connecting these pieces logically, the only structure that fits is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one (also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n\n    Structure: **CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃**\n\n    This structure is an α,β-unsaturated ketone and is fully consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization, meaning Compound X must be an isomer of the product, with the same molecular formula C11H12O. The reaction is carried out with DABCO (a base) at high temperature, suggesting a base-catalyzed or thermal rearrangement.\n\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The product contains a p-tolyl group. It is extremely unlikely that this group was formed during the reaction from a simple phenyl group. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must also contain a p-tolyl group.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** Formula is C₁₀H₁₀O. Incorrect molecular formula. It also contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n    *   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The name indicates a 4-methyl group on the styryl (phenylethenyl) moiety, which is a p-tolyl group. The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a styryl group, which is derived from benzene (phenyl group), not toluene (tolyl group). Therefore, it cannot be the starting material.\n    *   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound also contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be the starting material.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBy deducing the structure of the product from the NMR data, we identified a key structural feature: the p-tolyl group. Only one of the provided options for the starting material, Compound X, contains this group. Therefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The reaction is a known type of rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
