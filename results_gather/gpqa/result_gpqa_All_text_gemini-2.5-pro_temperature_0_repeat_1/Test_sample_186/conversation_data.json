    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Detection Criteria\nThe problem defines a star as \"detectable\" if the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with a single 8m VLT, can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO\nWe need to find the faintest apparent magnitude (V) a star can have and still meet the detection criteria. The provided ESO link for ESPRESSO has a performance table.\n\n*   **Reference:** The \"Performance and ETC\" section on the ESPRESSO overview page provides a table for the expected S/N for a 1-hour exposure using one Unit Telescope (1-UT).\n*   **Table Data (S/N at 550 nm for 1-hour exposure):**\n    *   V = 9 mag -> S/N = 230\n    *   V = 12 mag -> S/N = 80\n    *   V = 16 mag -> S/N = 15\n    *   V = 19 mag -> S/N = 3\n*   **Analysis:** The required S/N is 10.\n    *   A star with V = 16 mag gives an S/N of 15, which is greater than 10. So, a V=16 star is detectable.\n    *   A star with V = 19 mag gives an S/N of 3, which is less than 10. So, a V=19 star is not detectable.\n    *   The limiting magnitude is therefore between 16 and 19. Any star with an apparent magnitude V <= 16 is certainly detectable, and any star with V >= 19 is certainly not. Stars between V=16 and V=17.5 are very likely detectable.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Observatory Location\nThe VLT is located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n*   **Observability Constraint:** Stars very far in the northern celestial hemisphere cannot be observed from a southern latitude. Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89°. For an observer at 24.6° S, the North Celestial Pole is 24.6° below the northern horizon. Therefore, Polaris is never visible from Paranal.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Star Individually\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** -0.74. This is extremely bright.\n*   **Declination:** Approximately -52°. This is in the southern sky and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** It is far brighter than the limiting magnitude and is in an observable part of the sky. **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** +1.98. This is very bright and well within the magnitude limit.\n*   **Declination:** Approximately +89°.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to its extreme northern declination, Polaris is permanently below the horizon at Paranal and cannot be observed. **Not Detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Declination is 0° (on the celestial equator), which is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):** We use the distance modulus formula: `V = Mv - 5 + 5 * log10(d)`.\n    *   `V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(10)`\n    *   `V = 15 - 5 + 5 * 1 = 15`\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 15 is brighter than the limit (V=16 gives S/N=15). **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):**\n    *   `V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(200)`\n    *   `V ≈ 10 + 5 * 2.301 = 10 + 11.5 = 21.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 21.5 is much fainter than the limit (V=19 gives S/N=3). **Not Detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):**\n    *   `V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(5)`\n    *   `V ≈ 10 + 5 * 0.699 = 10 + 3.5 = 13.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 13.5 is significantly brighter than the limit. **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with Mv = 15 at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (V):**\n    *   `V = 15 - 5 + 5 * log10(50)`\n    *   `V ≈ 10 + 5 * 1.699 = 10 + 8.5 = 18.5`\n*   **Conclusion:** V = 18.5 is fainter than the limit. It falls between V=16 (S/N=15) and V=19 (S/N=3). Its S/N would be well below the required 10. **Not Detectable.**\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\nLet's tally the detectable stars:\n1.  **a) Canopus:** Yes\n2.  **b) Polaris:** No\n3.  **c) Star at 10 pc:** Yes\n4.  **d) Star at 200 pc:** No\n5.  **e) Star at 5 pc:** Yes\n6.  **f) Star at 50 pc:** No\n\nThe total number of detectable stars is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
