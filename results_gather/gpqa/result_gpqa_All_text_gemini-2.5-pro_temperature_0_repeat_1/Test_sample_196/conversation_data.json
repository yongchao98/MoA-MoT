    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its spectral data.**\n\n**A. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**B. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\nLet's analyze each signal to piece together the structure.\n\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent (which must be an electron-donating alkyl group).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (to identify the second substituent):**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests a `-CH₂-CH₃` (ethyl) fragment.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to the terminal methyl group (3H) and the methine proton (1H), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). Its chemical shift around 2.9 ppm is typical for a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This proton is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the adjacent methylene group (2H), leading to a complex multiplet.\n\n**C. Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n1.  We have a benzoic acid core.\n2.  It is para-substituted.\n3.  The other substituent is an alkyl group. Let's assemble it:\n    *   We have a `CH` group directly attached to the ring.\n    *   This `CH` is attached to a `-CH₃` group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet).\n    *   This `CH` is also attached to a `-CH₂CH₃` group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n4.  Putting it all together, the alkyl group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\nTherefore, the structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Compound X)\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)\n\nThe combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce many oxygen-containing functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically for this reaction:\n*   It reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The aromatic ring and the alkyl substituent are stable under these conditions and will not be changed.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nWe start with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 4 to a methyl group.\n\n*   Starting material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   The -COOH group is converted to a -CH₃ group.\n*   The sec-butyl group at position 1 remains unchanged.\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 4: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.** This matches our deduced final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
