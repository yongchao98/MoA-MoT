    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) for the given organic molecule, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n**2. List Careful Points:**\n*   **Correctly interpret the chemical structure:** The condensed formula must be translated into a full structural formula to accurately count the bonds.\n*   **Determine the molecular formula:** Count the total number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to find the molecular formula (CxHy).\n*   **Accurately count all bonds:** Systematically count the number of C-H, C-C (single), and C=C (double) bonds in the molecule. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Understand the definition of enthalpy of formation:** The enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The formation reaction is:\n    `x C(s, graphite) + (y/2) H2(g) → CxHy(g)`\n*   **Apply Hess's Law:** The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the given bond energies and enthalpy of atomization data via a thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law). The formula is:\n    `ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]`\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the product:** This is the sum of all the bond energies in one mole of the product molecule.\n*   **Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states to gaseous atoms. For `x C(s)` and `(y/2) H2(g)`, this is `[x * ΔH_atom(C)] + [(y/2) * BE(H-H)]`.\n*   **Check the units:** The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. The initial calculation will yield a result in kJ/mol. If this doesn't match an option, it must be converted to kJ/g by dividing by the molar mass of the compound.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure, Molecular Formula, and Bond Count**\n\n*   **Structure:** Let's draw the molecule from the formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    ```\n         CH3         CH3             CH3\n          |           |               |\n       H3C-C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C-CH3\n                          |\n                          CH3\n    ```\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=C<) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 1 (in CH3) + 1 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 1 (=C<) + 2 (in (CH3)2) = 12 Carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (=CH-) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (-CH<) + 3 (in CH3) + 2 (-CH2-) + 1 (=CH-) + 6 (in (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the main chain. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds (single):**\n        *   Bonds from methyl groups to the chain: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\n        *   Bonds within the main chain: 4\n        *   Total C-C bonds = 5 + 4 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product (C12H22)**\n\nThis is the sum of the energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n`ΔH_atom(product) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C))`\n`ΔH_atom(product) = (22 × 400 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (9 × 200 kJ/mol)`\n`ΔH_atom(product) = 8800 + 600 + 1800`\n`ΔH_atom(product) = 11200 kJ/mol`\n*(Note: This value matches option B, which is a common distractor. This is the enthalpy of atomization, not formation.)*\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`\nThe reactants are 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas.\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = [12 × ΔH_atom(C)] + [11 × BE(H-H)]`\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)`\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 + 1100`\n`ΔH_atom(reactants) = 13100 kJ`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol**\n\n`ΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]`\n`ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol`\n`ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol`\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options and Convert Units if Necessary**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. This value is not present in the options with the correct units (Option A is 1900 kJ/g). We must convert our answer to kJ/g and check again.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:**\n    *   `ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)`\n    *   `ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166`\n    *   `ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g`\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculated value of **11.44 kJ/g** matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
