    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2.\n    *   A magnetic field `B` is applied in the `+Z` direction.\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z B = -γ S_z B`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming the gyromagnetic ratio `γ` is positive (like for a positron), the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`. If `γ` were negative (like for an electron), the spin-down state would be lower energy, but the final result for the frequency remains the same. We will proceed assuming the initial state is `|+z>`.\n    *   So, at `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **The Change (at t = 0):**\n    *   The magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   In quantum mechanics, a \"sudden\" change means the process happens so quickly that the state vector of the system does not have time to change. Therefore, the state of the system immediately after the switch (at `t=0+`) is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n3.  **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):**\n    *   For `t > 0`, the magnetic field is `B` in the `+Y` direction.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B = -μ_y B = -γ S_y B`.\n\n4.  **Time Evolution (t > 0):**\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (since `S_z` and `S_y` do not commute). Therefore, the state is not stationary and will evolve in time.\n    *   The expectation value of any observable that does not commute with `H_new` will change with time. We are interested in `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`.\n    *   The time evolution of the system will be a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The frequency of oscillation of the expectation values is determined by the energy difference between the energy levels of `H_new`.\n\n5.  **Energy Levels of the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   The energy levels of `H_new = -γ S_y B` are determined by the eigenvalues of the `S_y` operator.\n    *   The `S_y` operator has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n        *   `E'_1 = -γ B (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n        *   `E'_2 = -γ B (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    *   The energy difference (or splitting) between these two levels is:\n        `ΔE = E'_2 - E'_1 = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   For any two-level quantum system, if the state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the expectation values of observables will oscillate with an angular frequency `Ω` given by the Bohr frequency relation:\n        `Ω = ΔE / ħ`\n    *   Substituting the energy difference we found:\n        `Ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Sudden\" Approximation:** This is crucial. It establishes that the initial state for the new dynamics is the final state of the old dynamics (`|+z>`).\n*   **\"Aligned with the field\":** This specifies the initial state as the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian.\n*   **Oscillation Frequency:** The question asks for the oscillation frequency. In this context, it refers to the angular frequency `Ω` (in radians per second), not the linear frequency `f = Ω/2π`. The units of the given options confirm this.\n*   **Larmor Precession:** This result is a direct consequence of Larmor precession. A magnetic moment in a magnetic field precesses around the field direction with the Larmor frequency, `Ω_L = γB`. Here, the initial spin is along Z, and the field is along Y, so the spin vector (and its expectation value) precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis with frequency `γB`. The Z-component of the spin will therefore oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe oscillation frequency `Ω` is determined by the energy splitting `ΔE` of the new Hamiltonian `H_new = -γ S_y B`.\n1.  Energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are `E = -γB * (eigenvalues of S_y)`.\n2.  Eigenvalues of `S_y` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n3.  Energy levels are `E_1 = -γBħ/2` and `E_2 = +γBħ/2`.\n4.  Energy splitting is `ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = γBħ`.\n5.  Oscillation frequency is `Ω = ΔE / ħ = γBħ / ħ = γB`.\n\nThe average of the z-component of the particle's moment will oscillate with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
