    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required energy difference.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and the ability to distinguish their energy levels. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) is bounded by the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The relation is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Terms:**\n    *   **Lifetime (τ):** This is the average time a quantum state exists before it decays. In the context of the uncertainty principle, the lifetime of the state is the uncertainty in time, so Δt = τ.\n    *   **Energy Uncertainty (ΔE):** Due to its finite lifetime, a quantum energy level is not perfectly sharp. It has a natural \"width\" or \"spread\" in energy, which is the energy uncertainty ΔE. This is also known as the natural linewidth.\n    *   **Resolvability:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two broadened levels will overlap too much to be seen as distinct.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty (Linewidth) for Each State:**\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s:\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime, τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty, ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n    *   We have two energy levels with widths ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   Notice that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (it is a \"broader\" line). This broader line is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n    *   For the two levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths. A more stringent condition is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the widths, but being greater than the dominant (larger) width is a necessary minimum condition.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is: |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n    *   |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We need to find the option for the energy difference |E1 - E2| that satisfies the condition |E1 - E2| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would be indistinguishable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is even smaller and thus not resolvable.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). This energy separation is large enough for the two broadened energy levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) is approximately 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this uncertainty. Among the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough.\n\n<<<D>>>"
