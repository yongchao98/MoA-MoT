    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents performs an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid (the CH3 group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile. It will displace the bromide ion from the alpha-carbon via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step alkylation process leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon alpha to both the cyano and ester groups, which is highly acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This forms NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining alpha-hydrogen. The resulting carbanion then performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis (other than the trivial C1 axis). The molecule is chiral, with C1 being the stereocenter.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons that are not interchangeable by rapid bond rotation (like in a methyl group) are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The five CH2 groups of the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in different chemical environments because there is no plane of symmetry.\n        *   Within each CH2 group, the two protons (one axial and one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic because they are on a ring with a stereocenter. They are not interchangeable and are chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 distinct CH2 groups, each contributing 2 distinct proton signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 × 2 = 10 signals.\n    *   **Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH2CH3) Protons:**\n        *   **-CH3 group:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to fast rotation around the C-C bond. This gives 1 signal.\n        *   **-CH2- group:** The two protons of the methylene group are technically diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Rigorously, they should give two distinct signals. However, in the context of typical spectroscopy problems, the effect of a chiral center that is several bonds away is often considered negligible, and these protons are treated as chemically equivalent. If we follow this common simplification, they give 1 signal.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the most rigorous chemical principles, the count would be 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 1 (ethyl CH3) = 13. This is not an option.\n    *   Applying the common simplification that the diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group are not resolved:\n        *   Signals from the ring = 10\n        *   Signals from the ethyl group = 1 (for -CH2-) + 1 (for -CH3-) = 2\n        *   Total signals = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nThis count matches one of the provided options.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n-   Ring protons: 10 distinct signals (5 CH2 groups, each with 2 diastereotopic protons).\n-   Ethyl group protons: 2 distinct signals (1 for the CH2 group, 1 for the CH3 group, applying the common simplification).\n-   Total = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\n<<<D>>>"
