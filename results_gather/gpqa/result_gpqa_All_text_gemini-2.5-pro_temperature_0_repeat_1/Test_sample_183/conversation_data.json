    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's examine the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)** at position 2. This is a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-directing group. It is very bulky.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n\nThe key relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Develop a General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis of polysubstituted benzenes requires careful consideration of the order of substitution and the directing effects of the groups.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The -OEt group is an ether. Ethers are commonly formed via the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting an alkoxide with an alkyl halide. This suggests the final step is the reaction of a phenol with a base and an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This means the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **The Main Challenge:** The core of the problem is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol. Let's analyze its structure:\n    *   -OH at C1\n    *   -tBu at C2\n    *   -NO2 at C3\n    The -OH group (a strong *o,p*-director) is *meta* to the -NO2 group. This is a very difficult arrangement to achieve through direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on a phenol, as the -OH group would direct nitration to the *ortho* (C2, C6) and *para* (C4) positions.\n\n*   **Plausible Strategy:** To overcome this directing group conflict, a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and/or the conversion of one functional group into another is necessary. The use of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a temporary blocking group is a common and powerful technique. It can be introduced to block a reactive position (like the *para* position) and then removed later in the synthesis (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (ii) produces p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Step (iv) attempts to react this with NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is for the diazotization of primary aromatic amines (-NH2), not nitro compounds (-NO2). This sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    Step (v) creates a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to sulfonate this diazonium salt using fuming sulfuric acid. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would decompose under these harsh conditions. This step is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This sequence includes sulfonation (step viii) followed immediately by desulfonation (step ix). This is a redundant and pointless pair of steps. The sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    Let's analyze this sequence carefully. It appears complex and contains a strange step, but let's trace the logic.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** The bulky t-Bu group directs the incoming -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, nitration occurs. The -tBu group directs *ortho*, and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step.\n    *   **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-Butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Diazonium salt:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   **Steps vi, vii, viii:** This is the most complex part. The sequence as written has a problematic step (vi, nitrating a diazonium salt). However, it's highly likely there is a typo in the order of these steps. A chemically logical sequence would be to first convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, then nitrate, then desulfonate. Let's see if that works:\n        *   **Let's assume the intended order was (v) → (vii) → (vi) → (viii):**\n        *   **(vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this phenol. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   -OH (at C2) is a strong *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -tBu (at C4) is an *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   -SO3H (at C1) is a *m*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n            *   Remarkably, all three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5. This would be a highly selective nitration. Let's assume substitution occurs at C3. The product is **3-nitro-4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        *   **(viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step causes desulfonation, removing the -SO3H group from C1. The resulting molecule has -OH at C2, -NO2 at C3, and -tBu at C4. Renaming this according to IUPAC rules (phenol is the parent), we get **3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Wait, this is an isomer of our target precursor!** The target precursor is 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This means even with a logical reordering, sequence A does not produce the exact target molecule.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the steps of the correct option. However, when forced to choose the best option among the given choices:\n*   Options B, C, and D contain clear, fundamental chemical errors that make them invalid.\n*   Option A outlines a sophisticated and strategically sound plan: it uses a blocking group to control regiochemistry, followed by functional group interconversions. While it contains a questionable step (vi) as written, and even a logical reordering leads to an isomer, its overall framework is far superior to the other options. In the context of a multiple-choice question, one must select the \"most plausible\" or \"least incorrect\" pathway. The strategy employed in option A is the only one that demonstrates a correct approach to solving this type of complex synthesis problem.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the intended answer, despite its apparent flaws.\n\n<<<A>>>"
