    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Specifically, it deals with the concept of **time dilation**. When an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer, the observer will measure time passing more slowly for the moving object than for themselves.\n\n*   **Inertial Frames of Reference:** The problem states that both the Galaxy and the ejecta are inertial frames. This is a key condition for applying the formulas of special relativity.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** This is the time measured in the rest frame of an event. In this case, the 50 seconds is measured by a clock on the ejecta, so it is the proper time.\n*   **Dilated Time (Δt):** This is the time measured by an observer in a different frame of reference that is moving relative to the event. In this case, it's the time that passes in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This is the factor by which time, length, and mass are altered for a moving object. It is always greater than or equal to 1.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   Relative velocity of the ejecta (v): 60,000 km/s\n*   Speed of light (c): approximately 300,000 km/s\n*   Proper time in the ejecta's frame (Δt₀): 50 s\n\n**3. Identify the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the **Galaxy's reference frame**. Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.**\n    To use the relativity formulas, we need the ratio `v/c`.\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    Substitute the value of `v/c`:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    For calculation purposes, we can use the binomial approximation for `γ` when `v` is much smaller than `c`, which is `γ ≈ 1 + (v²/2c²)`.\n    `γ ≈ 1 + (0.04 / 2) = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n    This approximation is very accurate for this speed and often intended for such problems.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    This is the dilated time, found using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    Using the approximated `γ`:\n    `Δt ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n    So, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy measures 51 seconds passing.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).**\n    The distance is the velocity (as measured in the Galaxy frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (also in the Galaxy frame).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s`\n    `d ≈ 3,060,000 km`\n\n**5. Review and Final Check**\n\n*   The question asks for distance in the Galaxy frame. This requires using the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`), not the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`).\n*   A common mistake would be to calculate `d = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option D). This is the non-relativistic answer and is incorrect because it ignores time dilation.\n*   Our calculation, which correctly applies time dilation, gives 3,060,000 km, which matches option B exactly.\n*   (Self-Correction Check): If we use the more precise value for `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206`, the distance would be `d = 60,000 * (1.0206 * 50) ≈ 3,061,800 km`. This value is extremely close to 3,060,000 km, confirming that B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
