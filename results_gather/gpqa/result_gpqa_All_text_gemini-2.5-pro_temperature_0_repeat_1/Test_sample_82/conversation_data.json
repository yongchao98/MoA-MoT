    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Final volume of the solution (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n*   (0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\n*   M₂ = (0.05 × 20.00) / 40.00 = 1.00 / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   **Careful Point:** The concentration of the acetic acid solution being titrated is 0.025 M, not the initial 0.05 M.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.**\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1.\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n*   Moles of acetic acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\n*   Let V_eq be the volume of NaOH at the equivalence point.\n*   Moles of NaOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × V_eq.\n*   0.001 mol = 0.1 mol/L × V_eq\n*   V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   **Careful Point:** This volume is essential for calculating the conditions at different stages of the titration.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n*   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is converted to base, and 75% remains as acid. The ratio of moles [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 4.26.\n*   **Careful Point:** In a buffer region, the ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the most direct method here.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n*   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid solution plus the volume of NaOH added: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] is: Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, making the solution basic: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We use the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n*   Now, calculate pOH: pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n*   Finally, calculate pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is 8.52.\n*   **Careful Point:** At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH is greater than 7 due to the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. Remember to use the total volume to calculate the concentration of this base.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n*   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
