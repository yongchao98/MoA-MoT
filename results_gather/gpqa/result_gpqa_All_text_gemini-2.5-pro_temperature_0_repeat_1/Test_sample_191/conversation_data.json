    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n*   We have a spherical conductor that is initially uncharged. Its radius is $R$ and its center is at a point we'll call $O_c$.\n*   Inside this conductor, there is a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is $r$ and its center, $O_v$, is at a distance $s$ from the conductor's center $O_c$.\n*   A positive point charge $+q$ is placed at some arbitrary location inside this cavity.\n*   We need to find the electric field at a point P, which is located outside the conductor.\n*   The distance from the conductor's center $O_c$ to point P is $L$.\n*   The distance from the cavity's center $O_v$ to point P is $l$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Effect of the Charge Inside the Cavity (Charge Induction)**\n*   The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract free electrons within the conductor.\n*   These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). This creates an induced negative charge on the inner surface.\n*   A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero.\n*   To achieve a zero field inside the conductor, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be exactly $-q$. This induced charge $-q$ will distribute itself on the cavity wall in such a way that its electric field perfectly cancels the electric field of the point charge $+q$ for all points outside the cavity.\n\n**3. Analyze the Charge on the Outer Surface**\n*   The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0).\n*   A charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface.\n*   To maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n**4. Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding**\n*   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced only by the charges on its outer surface (and any other charges that might be outside the conductor, but there are none in this problem).\n*   The charges inside the cavity (the original $+q$ and the induced $-q$ on the inner surface) are \"shielded\" from the outside. Their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, including at point P.\n*   Therefore, to find the field at P, we only need to consider the field produced by the $+q$ charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n**5. Determine the Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface**\n*   We have a total charge of $+q$ on the outer surface, which is a sphere of radius $R$.\n*   Since there are no external electric fields, and the internal charges are shielded, this charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer spherical surface. This is the lowest energy configuration for the charges.\n\n**6. Calculate the Electric Field at Point P**\n*   According to the Shell Theorem (a consequence of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere.\n*   In our case, the outer surface is a sphere centered at $O_c$. The total charge on it is $+q$.\n*   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center $O_c$.\n*   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge $+q$ located at $O_c$.\n*   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**7. Evaluate the Given Options**\n*   The result from our analysis is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n*   This matches option C.\n*   The other options involve distances like $l$ (distance from the cavity's center) and geometric combinations involving $s$ and $\\theta$. This information is extraneous and serves as a distractor. The shielding property of the conductor makes the exact location of the cavity and the charge within it irrelevant to the external electric field.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The conductor is initially uncharged. If it had an initial charge $Q$, the charge on the outer surface would be $Q+q$.\n*   The outer surface of the conductor is spherical. This is crucial for the charge to distribute uniformly and for the simple $1/L^2$ formula to apply.\n*   The point P is outside the conductor ($L>R$). Inside the conductor's material, the field is zero.\n*   The principle of electrostatic shielding is the key concept. The conductor isolates the \"outside world\" from the electrostatic details of what's happening inside the cavity. The only information that gets \"communicated\" to the outside is the net total charge inside the cavity.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1.  Charge $+q$ is placed in the cavity.\n2.  This induces $-q$ on the inner surface and leaves $+q$ on the outer surface.\n3.  The field outside is due only to the $+q$ on the outer surface.\n4.  The outer surface is a sphere of radius $R$ centered at $O_c$. The charge $+q$ spreads uniformly on it.\n5.  The field at an external point P (distance $L$ from $O_c$) is as if all the charge $+q$ were a point charge at the center $O_c$.\n6.  Therefore, $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
