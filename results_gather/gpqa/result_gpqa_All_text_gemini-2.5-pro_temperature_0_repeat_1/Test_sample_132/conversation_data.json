    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Chemical Species and Reactions**\n*   The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O) in water.\n*   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely in water to give K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely in water to give 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2H₂O.\n*   The key species are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which form a conjugate acid-base pair. This means the solution is a buffer.\n*   The relevant equilibria for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) are:\n    1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ ; Ka₁ = 7.5x10⁻³\n    2.  H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    3.  HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n*   The buffer system is based on the second equilibrium (governed by Ka₂). The ion we want to find, the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻), is produced in the third equilibrium (governed by Ka₃).\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of the Buffer Components**\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol H₂PO₄⁻\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol HPO₄²⁻\n\n**3. Calculate the Initial Concentrations of the Buffer Components**\n*   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³. We must convert this to liters.\n*   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 200.00 mL = 0.20000 L\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺] of the Buffer**\n*   The [H⁺] is determined by the buffer equilibrium involving H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by Ka₂.\n*   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   We can rearrange this equation to solve for [H⁺]:\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**\n*   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by Ka₃.\n*   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   We rearrange this equation to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   We use the [H⁺] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]. This is a valid approximation because Ka₃ is extremely small, meaning very little HPO₄²⁻ will actually dissociate.\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (5.0562 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n*   The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n*   Comparing this result to the given options:\n    *   A) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   B) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   C) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n    *   D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n*   The calculated value matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Correct Molar Mass:** Ensure you use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form.\n*   **Volume Conversion:** Always convert the volume from cm³ or mL to L for molarity calculations.\n*   **Identifying the Buffer System:** Recognize that H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ form the primary buffer. This means Ka₂ is used to find the system's [H⁺].\n*   **Identifying the Target Equilibrium:** The question asks for [PO₄³⁻], which is a product of the third dissociation step, governed by Ka₃.\n*   **Approximation Validity:** The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations is valid because they are part of a buffer and their concentrations are much larger than the Ka values. Similarly, the change in [HPO₄²⁻] due to the third dissociation is negligible because Ka₃ is very small.\n\n<<<A>>>"
