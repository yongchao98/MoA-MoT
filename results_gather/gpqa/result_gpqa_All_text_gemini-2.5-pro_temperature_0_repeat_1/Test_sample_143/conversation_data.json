    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Given Information\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance ($L$)** of a particle in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n*   Total energy of the particle X: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle X: $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (This implies the rest energy is $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$)\n*   Decay width of the particle X: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### Step 2: Identify Necessary Physical Concepts and Formulas\n1.  **Proper Mean Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is called the proper lifetime. It is inversely related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. The lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau$) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $t_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The distance the particle travels in the lab frame is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$):\n    $L = v \\cdot t_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau$\n\n4.  **Relativistic Kinematics:**\n    *   The velocity is often expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   The formula for the decay distance can be written as $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$.\n    *   A more direct calculation can be done using the relativistic momentum ($p_X$). The energy-momentum relation is $E_X^2 = (p_X c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n    *   The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be expressed as $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   Substituting these into the formula for $L$, we get:\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\tau = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n        This final formula is very convenient as it uses the given energy/mass values directly and the well-known constant $\\hbar c$.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n**Careful Point:** Ensure all units are consistent. We will work with GeV for energy, mass, and width.\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV} = 0.320 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   We will use the value of the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm} = 0.197327 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$, where 1 fm (femtometer) = $10^{-15}$ m.\n\n**Sub-step 3.1: Calculate the momentum term, $p_X c$.**\nFrom the energy-momentum relation:\n$(p_X c)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2$\n$(p_X c)^2 = (8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$p_X c = \\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 7.9095 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Sub-step 3.2: Calculate the mean decay distance, $L$.**\nUsing the formula derived in Step 2:\n$L = \\left(\\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nPlug in the values:\n$L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\frac{0.197327 \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\nThe GeV units cancel out, leaving the result in femtometers (fm).\n$L = \\left(\\frac{7.9095}{1.2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.197327}{0.320}\\right) \\text{ fm}$\n$L \\approx (6.59124) \\times (0.616647) \\text{ fm}$\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n**Sub-step 3.3: Convert the result to meters.**\nSince 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m:\n$L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Answer\nThe calculated mean decay distance is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nOur calculated value matches option C exactly.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   Distinguish between proper lifetime ($\\tau$) and lab-frame lifetime ($t_{lab}$). The decay distance is calculated in the lab frame.\n*   Use the full relativistic expression for the decay distance, $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$, not a non-relativistic approximation or an incorrect simplification like $L = c\\tau$ or $L = \\gamma c\\tau$.\n*   Maintain consistent units throughout the calculation (e.g., convert MeV to GeV).\n*   Using the combined constant $\\hbar c$ simplifies the calculation and reduces rounding errors from using separate values for $\\hbar$ and $c$. The formula $L = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$ is the most efficient for this problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
