    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept: Regularization at high energies.**\n\n*   **What is it?** In physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), when we try to calculate physical quantities (like the mass or charge of a particle), our calculations sometimes give an infinite result. This usually happens when we consider processes involving virtual particles with extremely high energy (or equivalently, interactions at extremely short distances). This problem is known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence\".\n*   **Regularization** is a mathematical technique used to manage these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory to make the calculations give a finite, albeit physically incorrect, answer. This is often done by introducing a \"cutoff\" parameter that limits the maximum energy allowed in the calculations.\n*   **Why is it needed?** Regularization is the first step in a two-step process called renormalization. After regularizing, physicists redefine the \"bare\" parameters of the theory (like mass and charge) to absorb the infinite parts. The final result for observable quantities becomes finite and independent of the artificial cutoff.\n*   **The question asks:** Which of the listed theories is fundamentally constructed in such a way that these high-energy infinities never appear in the first place, making the process of regularization unnecessary?\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each option.**\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It describes the interaction between charged particles (like electrons) and photons. When calculating corrections to properties like the electron's mass or charge, loop diagrams in QED lead to divergent integrals (infinities). QED is a \"renormalizable\" theory, which means the process of regularization and renormalization works successfully to yield finite, highly accurate predictions. However, the key point is that it **does require** regularization.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. While it is not a quantum theory, it has its own infinity problem. If you model an electron as a true mathematical point with zero size, the energy stored in its own electric field (its \"self-energy\") becomes infinite. To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the problem, for instance, by assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius. This is a classic problem that shows even classical theories can have divergences at short distances (high energies) that need to be handled. Therefore, it **does require** a form of regularization.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of the strong force, which governs quarks and gluons. Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory. Calculations involving loop diagrams also lead to UV divergences. Like QED, QCD is a renormalizable theory, and the procedure is essential for making predictions. Therefore, QCD **does require** regularization.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a candidate for a \"theory of everything.\" Its fundamental premise is that elementary particles are not point-like, but are instead tiny, vibrating, one-dimensional \"strings.\" This seemingly small change has a profound consequence. In QFT, infinities arise from interactions happening at a single point in spacetime. In string theory, interactions are \"smeared out\" because the strings themselves are extended objects. When two strings interact, they merge or split over a small region, not at a single point. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the interactions at very short distances (high energies) and eliminates the UV divergences that plague QFTs. As a result, calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory yield finite results without the need for an ad-hoc regularization and renormalization procedure. The theory is considered to be \"UV-finite.\"\n\n**Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n\n*   QED, QCD, and even Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities related to high-energy/short-distance behavior that must be dealt with using some form of regularization.\n*   Superstring Theory is specifically formulated in a way that avoids these high-energy infinities from the outset, due to the extended nature of strings.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the one theory on the list that never requires regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
