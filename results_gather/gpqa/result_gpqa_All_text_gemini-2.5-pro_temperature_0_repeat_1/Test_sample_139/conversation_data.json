    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between G and B**\nPrecipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This means that G is a deuterated hydrate, a compound that incorporates D₂O into its structure, which is released upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, would decompose upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. Its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some common gases:\n*   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). **(p = n)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O.\n*   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\nGiven the context of deuterium, D₂ is the most likely candidate for W.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Substance X and the reaction**\n*   Substance X contains a heavier isotope. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits the description perfectly. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. It is logical to assume the reaction here is between LiAlD₄ (X) and D₂O (Y, a liquid that fits the context).\n*   Let's write the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n*   Let's check if this reaction matches the clues:\n    *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of metal hydrides/deuterides with water/heavy water is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As determined in Step 3, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the final clue**\n*   The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group. It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n*   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (excess) → (workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH.\n*   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue confirms our identification of X.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer**\nWe have identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within this substance.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Hydrogen (H, Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Al, Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   Lithium (Li, Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Sum the masses of these elements as they appear in the molecule:** The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" instructs us to count all atoms of the specified elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of Al is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative mass:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from lightest element's atoms) + (Mass from heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
