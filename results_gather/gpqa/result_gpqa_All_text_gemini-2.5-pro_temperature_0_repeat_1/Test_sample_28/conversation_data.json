    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find a mutation that will most likely render the gene non-functional. A non-functional gene will not produce the active enzyme responsible for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to achieve this is through a mutation that either drastically alters the protein's structure or, more definitively, prevents its full synthesis.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nFirst, we need to determine the reading frame and the initial amino acid sequence of the functional gene. The genetic code is read in triplets (codons) starting from the start codon `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’\n*   **Breaking it into codons:**\n    *   `ATG` - Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` - Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` - Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` - Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` - Glycine (Gly)\n    *   `ACT` - Threonine (Thr)\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Individually**\nWe will now compare each mutant sequence to the intact sequence, identify the type of mutation, and predict its effect on the resulting protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’\n    *   Comparison with Intact:\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein will have one amino acid different from the original. This *might* affect the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The impact depends on how critical that specific Leucine residue is for the protein's structure and function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’\n    *   Comparison with Intact:\n        *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a **silent mutation** (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence (at the 3rd amino acid position). Translation will terminate here, producing a tiny, non-functional peptide of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This will almost certainly eliminate the enzyme's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’\n    *   Comparison with Intact:\n        *   Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**.\n        *   Codon 6: `ACT` (Threonine) -> `GTC` (Valine). This is also a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein will have two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of disrupting function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’\n    *   Comparison with Intact:\n        *   Intact: `...GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant: `...GCT --- ACT...`\n        *   The codon `GGT` (coding for Glycine) has been deleted. A deletion of three nucleotides is an **in-frame deletion**.\n        *   Additionally, Codon 3: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). Because the deletion is \"in-frame\" (a multiple of 3), the reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. This might disrupt the protein's function, but it is not as disruptive as a frameshift or a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nComparing the potential effects of the four mutations:\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in proteins with one or two amino acid changes or a single amino acid deletion. These proteins might still retain some or all of their function.\n*   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most likely to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by knocking out the function of the responsible enzyme.\n\n<<<A>>>"
