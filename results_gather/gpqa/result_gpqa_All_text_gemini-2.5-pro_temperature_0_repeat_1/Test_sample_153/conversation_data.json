    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound. So, MW = 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity of this M+2 peak is 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M:M+2 intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8% and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%).\n*   **Careful Point:** The molecular weight of 156 corresponds to the molecule containing the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive and broad absorption band. It is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region (C=O). A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch (often obscuring the C-H stretches) and a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**).\n    *   **Integration:** The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting:** It is a singlet (s), which is typical for acidic protons that exchange rapidly and do not show coupling to adjacent protons.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Both signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), indicating the presence of a benzene ring. The downfield positions suggest the ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Integration:** There are a total of 2H + 2H = 4 aromatic protons. This means the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   **Splitting:** The pattern consists of two doublets (d). This specific pattern, where two signals each account for two protons, is a classic signature of a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-isomer makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Careful Point:** An ortho (1,2) or meta (1,3) disubstituted ring would give a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets for 2H each.\n\n**4. Synthesis of Information and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Summary of Findings:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156, contains one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Proposed Structure:** The only structure that fits all these criteria is a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Let's verify the options:**\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: Incorrect functional groups. Lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group seen in IR and NMR.\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Incorrect functional groups (aldehyde and phenol, not carboxylic acid) and would have a different NMR splitting pattern for the 3 aromatic protons.\n    *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n        *   MW = 156.5 g/mol (for ³⁵Cl). **Matches MS.**\n        *   Contains one Cl. **Matches MS.**\n        *   Is a carboxylic acid. **Matches IR and NMR (11.0 ppm signal).**\n        *   Is para-disubstituted. **Matches the ¹H NMR aromatic pattern (two doublets, 2H each).**\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho-substitution pattern would lead to a complex ¹H NMR spectrum for the 4 aromatic protons, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe spectral data unambiguously points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
