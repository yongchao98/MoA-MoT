    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state |alpha>**\n\nThe state of the electron is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's call this unnormalized state `|ψ>`.\n`|ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`\n\nIn matrix notation, using `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, we have:\n`|ψ> = [ (1+i), (2-i) ]`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find its norm squared, `<ψ|ψ>`, and then divide the state by the square root of this norm. The bra vector `<ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ>`:\n`<ψ| = [ (1-i), (2+i) ]`\n\nNow, calculate the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`:\n`<ψ|ψ> = [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `N = 1 / sqrt(<ψ|ψ>) = 1 / sqrt(7)`.\nThe normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * ( (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ) = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]`\n\n**Step 2: Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij`:\n*   `Aij = 0` if `i = j` (diagonal elements are zero)\n*   `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` (off-diagonal elements are `hbar/2`)\n\nFor a 2-state system (spin up/down), the matrix representation of A is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nNote that `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` is the Pauli matrix `σ_x`. So, `A = (hbar/2) * σ_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (let's call them `λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det( [[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]] ) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (hbar/2)²`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\nFor `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n`(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0`\n`[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [x, y] = 0`\nThis gives the equation `- (hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = y`.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`. Normalizing it gives:\n`|v₁> = (1/sqrt(1²+1²)) * [1, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`\n\nFor `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n`(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0`\n`[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [x, y] = 0`\nThis gives the equation `(hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -y`.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`. Normalizing it gives:\n`|v₂> = (1/sqrt(1²+(-1)²)) * [1, -1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|vi>` (and thus obtaining the eigenvalue `λi`) is given by `P(λi) = |<vi|alpha>|²`.\n\nProbability for `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n`P₁ = |<v₁|alpha>|²`\n`<v₁|alpha> = ( (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] ) * ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ] )`\n`<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * ( 1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i) )`\n`<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n`P₁ = |3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\nProbability for `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n`P₂ = |<v₂|alpha>|²`\n`<v₂|alpha> = ( (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] ) * ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ] )`\n`<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * ( 1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i) )`\n`<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n`P₂ = |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average (expectation) value of the operator A**\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\nMethod 1: Using the probabilities and eigenvalues.\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\nMethod 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\n`A|alpha> = ( (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] ) * ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ] )`\n`A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ]`\nNow, calculate `<alpha|A|alpha>`:\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] ) * ( (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [ (2-i), (1+i) ] )`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * ( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) )`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * ( (2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) )`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * ( (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) )`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * ( (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) )`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar / 14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same average value: **hbar/7**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
