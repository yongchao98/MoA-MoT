    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond. This is a classic example of a **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic Attack):** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. The pi electrons of the C=O bond move to the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The negatively charged alkoxide intermediate is a base. It needs to be protonated by a proton source (an acid) to form the final stable cyanohydrin product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        `CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2-CH3 + H⁺ → CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3`\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:**\n    *   Reagent A's role is to provide the proton (H⁺) for the second step. This is typically done by adding an acid to the reaction mixture.\n    *   H₃O⁺ represents a hydronium ion, which is the form an acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ takes in water. It is an excellent proton source for this step.\n    *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is used for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction (bisulfite addition) and would not lead to the desired cyanohydrin product.\n    *   Therefore, **A must be an acid source, represented by H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water. This is a **hydrolysis of a nitrile**. The rest of the molecule, including the hydroxyl group, remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The process involves the addition of two molecules of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. After a series of steps, the nitrile is converted first to an amide, which is then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** A strong base (like NaOH) can also be used, but it would produce a carboxylate salt, which would then require a separate acidification step to form the final carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:**\n    *   Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and is a standard and effective reagent for catalyzing the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a single step.\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to efficiently drive the hydrolysis to completion. Strong mineral acids are required.\n    *   Therefore, **B is a strong acid catalyst, like HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, Reagent A is an acid source for protonation, making **H₃O⁺** the correct choice.\n*   For the second reaction, Reagent B is a strong acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis, making **HCl** the correct choice.\n\nMatching these findings with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  -> **This matches our analysis.**\n*   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH -> Incorrect.\n*   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH -> Incorrect, as CH₃COOH is a poor catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n*   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl -> Incorrect.\n\nThe most suitable reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
