    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the molecular symmetry group of the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically the nitration of toluene.\n    *   **Reagents:** Nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generate the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n    *   **Substrate:** Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring. The methyl group is an activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of *ortho*-nitrotoluene and *para*-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group at the *ortho* position, the *para* isomer is the major product. We will assume the reaction proceeds to give the major product.\n    *   **Product 1 is para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an oxidation reaction.\n    *   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of a strong acid like sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   **Substrate:** Product 1 is *para*-nitrotoluene. This molecule has a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. The carbon of the methyl group is a benzylic carbon.\n    *   **Transformation:** Strong oxidizing agents like MnO₂ or KMnO₄ oxidize alkyl groups at the benzylic position to carboxylic acids, provided there is at least one benzylic hydrogen. The methyl group (-CH₃) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO₂) is resistant to these oxidation conditions.\n    *   **Product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).**\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the most complex step. We have a nitroaromatic compound (*p*-nitrobenzoic acid), a base (NaOH), and a compound that can act as a reducing agent (acetone, via its enolate).\n    *   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base. It will deprotonate the carboxylic acid to form sodium *para*-nitrobenzoate. It will also deprotonate acetone to form its enolate (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The conditions are suitable for the reductive coupling of the nitro group. The acetone enolate acts as the reducing agent (it gets oxidized in the process), and the basic medium facilitates the coupling of two nitroaromatic molecules. This reaction forms an azo compound.\n    *   **Product 3:** Two molecules of *para*-nitrobenzoic acid are coupled at the nitrogen atoms to form 4,4'-azodibenzoic acid. The N=N double bond can exist as two stereoisomers: (E) and (Z). The (E)-isomer (trans) is significantly more stable and is the expected major product.\n    *   **Product 3 is (E)-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid.**\n\n**Analysis of Molecular Symmetry**\n\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** (E)-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid. The structure consists of two *para*-substituted benzene rings linked by a trans -N=N- group.\n    HOOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COOH\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's analyze the symmetry of this molecule, assuming its most stable, planar conformation.\n    1.  **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule is centrosymmetric. There is a center of inversion at the midpoint of the N=N double bond. Inverting any atom through this point leads to an identical atom.\n    2.  **Axis of Rotation (C₂):** There is a two-fold axis of rotation (C₂) that is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passes through the inversion center. Rotating the molecule by 180° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    3.  **Plane of Symmetry (σh):** There is a mirror plane that contains the entire planar molecule. Since this plane is perpendicular to the principal C₂ axis, it is designated as a horizontal plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses an identity element (E), a single C₂ axis, a center of inversion (i), and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) belongs to the **C₂h** point group.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   The regiochemistry of the initial nitration must be correctly identified as *para* being the major product.\n*   The oxidation in the second step must be recognized as specific to the benzylic position, leaving the nitro group intact.\n*   The third reaction is the most challenging to identify. Recognizing the reductive coupling of nitroarenes to form azo compounds under basic conditions with a suitable reducing agent is key. Other possibilities like nucleophilic aromatic substitution are less likely and lead to products with lower symmetry that do not match the options as well.\n*   The final symmetry analysis must be performed on the correct and most stable isomer, which is the (E)-isomer of the azo product. It is important to correctly identify all symmetry elements to assign the point group and distinguish it from similar groups like D₂h (which would require more C₂ axes) or C₂ᵥ.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Product 3 is (E)-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid, which has a C₂h point group. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
