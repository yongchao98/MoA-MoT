    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the starting material and its stereochemistry.**\nThe starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.\n*   The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   The carbon atom at position 3 (C3) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂), a methyl group (-CH₃), an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and a hydrogen atom (-H).\n*   \"Racemic\" means it is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's denote them as (R)-alkene and (S)-alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction.**\nThe reaction is with Grubbs catalyst, which catalyzes olefin metathesis. Since only one type of alkene is present, it will undergo self-metathesis (also called homodimerization).\nThe general reaction for a terminal alkene is:\n2 R-CH=CH₂  ⇌  R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\nIn our case, the 'R' group is the sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\nThe reaction is:\n2 CH₂(CH₃)CH-CH=CH₂  ⇌  CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃ + CH₂=CH₂\nThe product we need to analyze is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The question asks to exclude ethene.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the stereochemistry of the product.**\nThe product molecule, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a new double bond (at C4) which can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry. We need to consider all possible combinations that can be formed from the racemic starting mixture.\n\n**Step 5: Consider all possible reaction combinations from the racemic mixture.**\nSince the starting material contains both (R)-alkene and (S)-alkene, three different reaction pairings are possible:\n1.  (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene\n2.  (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n3.  (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the products from each reaction pairing.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene**\n    This reaction will produce 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene where both chiral centers have the (R) configuration. The product is (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The new double bond can be E or Z, leading to two distinct products which are diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n    *   Product 2: (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene**\n    This reaction will produce 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene where both chiral centers have the (S) configuration. The product is (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, both E and Z isomers are possible.\n    *   Product 3: (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of Product 1)\n    *   Product 4: (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, enantiomer of Product 2)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene**\n    This cross-reaction will produce 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene with one (R) and one (S) chiral center. The product is (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Because the molecule's carbon skeleton is symmetrical, a compound with (3R, 6S) configuration is a meso compound (it is achiral due to internal symmetry). The E/Z isomerism of the double bond results in two different meso compounds, which are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   Product 5: (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral)\n    *   Product 6: (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral)\n\n**Step 7: Count the total number of unique products.**\nBy listing all the possible stereoisomers formed, we have:\n1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n2.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n3.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n5.  (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n6.  (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\nAll six of these are distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers) and are all possible products of the reaction. Therefore, there are a total of 6 possible products.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Reaction of (R) with (R) gives two products (E and Z isomers of the (R,R) product).\n*   Reaction of (S) with (S) gives two products (E and Z isomers of the (S,S) product). These are the enantiomers of the (R,R) products.\n*   Reaction of (R) with (S) gives two products (E and Z isomers of the (R,S) meso product).\n*   Total products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
