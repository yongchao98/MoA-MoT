    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and the Method of Images**\n\n*   **System:** We have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   **Condition:** The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V = 0).\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n*   **Method:** This is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the \"method of images.\" The effect of the grounded sphere on the external charge `q` can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing an \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the original sphere's volume. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (measured from the center, along the same line as `d`) are given by the standard formulas:\n\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The image charge is located inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`. This ensures an attractive force.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force (Work Done)**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against the electric force from the sphere.\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n\n*   **Force `F(x)`:** The force on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n    *   `q'(x) = -q * (R / x)`\n    *   `b(x) = R^2 / x`\n    *   Distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R/x * 1/((x^2-R^2)/x)^2`\n    *   `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2/(x^2-R^2)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n*   **Integration:** Now we integrate to find the work.\n    *   `U = - ∫[∞, d] (-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`. The integral becomes `∫(1/u^2) (du/2) = -1/(2u)`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    *   `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    *   The term with infinity goes to zero.\n    *   `U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2)) = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n*   **`V_induced`:** This is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all *other* charges, which in this case are the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charges (and the potential they create) are themselves proportional to `q`. The energy is not simply `qV` as it would be for a test charge in a fixed external potential.\n*   **Calculation:** The potential from the induced charges at distance `d` is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'` at that point.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    *   Distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   **Final Energy:** Substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Answer Analysis**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, has `R^2` instead of `R`.\nB) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` - Incorrect, missing the `1/2` factor and has `d` instead of `R`.\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` - **This matches our result.**\nD) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` - Incorrect numerator and denominator.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is negative, which makes physical sense because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive. Work is done by the field as the charge is brought from infinity, so the potential energy of the system decreases from its zero reference at infinity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
