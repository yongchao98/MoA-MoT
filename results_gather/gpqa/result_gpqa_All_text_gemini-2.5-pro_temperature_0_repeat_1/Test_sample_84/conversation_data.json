    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_eff_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_eff_star and R_star are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), so the (1 - A)^(1/4) term also cancels out.\n    *   The constant '2' inside the square root cancels out.\n    This simplifies the expression significantly:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    This means we only need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Find the Semi-Major Axes (a) from Radial Velocity Data:** The semi-major axis is not given directly, but we can derive it from the radial velocity (RV) data.\n    *   First, relate the given Doppler shift (Δλ) to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star). The Doppler effect formula is Δλ / λ_0 = v_r / c. The maximum shift corresponds to K_star.\n        K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    *   Since c (speed of light) and λ_0 (rest wavelength) are constants, K_star is directly proportional to Δλ. Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocities is:\n        K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n6.  **Relate K_star to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (assuming sin(i) ≈ 1, which is a valid assumption for a system detected by both transit and RV) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital distance (a) by the following relation, derived from conservation of momentum and Kepler's laws:\n    K_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    (This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which is true here).\n\n7.  **Isolate the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K_star^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):** Now we can form the ratio a_2 / a_1 using the expression from the previous step.\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]\n    *   The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and cancel out.\n    This leaves:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n9.  **Substitute the Known Ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n    *   Velocity ratio: K_star1 / K_star2 = 3/4\n    Substitute these values into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now we substitute this result back into our simplified temperature ratio formula from Step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Final Value:**\n    15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides many values that are not needed for the final calculation, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, the planets' radii, and the specific wavelength of the spectral line. These values cancel out when forming the ratios.\n*   **Key Relationships:** The solution hinges on understanding the proportional relationships: T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) and K_star ∝ M_p / sqrt(a).\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the orbits being circular and viewed nearly edge-on (sin(i)≈1), which is justified by the problem statement (\"circular orbits\" and detection via both transit and RV).\n*   **Index Tracking:** It is crucial to keep track of which planet is '1' and which is '2' throughout the derivation to ensure the final ratio is T_eq1/T_eq2 and not its inverse.\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
