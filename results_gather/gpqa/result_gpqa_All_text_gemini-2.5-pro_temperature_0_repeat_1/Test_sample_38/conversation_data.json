    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the value of \"a\".\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The fundamental principle we need to use is the **normalization condition** of a wave function in quantum mechanics. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    The integral is taken over all space.\n\n2.  **Define the Integration Limits:** The problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. This means the wave function ψ(x) is zero everywhere else. Therefore, our integration limits are from 1 to 3. The normalization condition becomes:\n    ∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²:**\n    The wave function is given as a complex function:\n    ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n    The probability density, |ψ(x)|², is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate, ψ*(x). To find the complex conjugate, we replace 'i' with '-i':\n    ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\n    Now, we multiply them:\n    |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n    |ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n\n    This is in the form (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B².\n    Here, A = a / sqrt(1 + x) and B = 0.5*i.\n    |ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\n\n    Since i² = -1:\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n4.  **Set up and Solve the Normalization Integral:**\n    Now we substitute the expression for |ψ(x)|² into our normalization integral:\n    ∫₁³ ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫₁³ ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **Part 1: Integrate the first term.**\n        Since 'a²' is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n        a² ∫₁³ ( 1 / (1 + x) ) dx\n        The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n        a² * [ ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3\n        = a² * [ ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1) ]\n        = a² * [ ln(4) - ln(2) ]\n        Using the logarithm rule ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n        = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Part 2: Integrate the second term.**\n        ∫₁³ 0.25 dx\n        = [ 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3\n        = (0.25 * 3) - (0.25 * 1)\n        = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    Now, we combine the results of the two parts and set the sum equal to 1:\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n    Isolate the term with a²:\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\n    Solve for a²:\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n    Using the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\n    a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\n    a² ≈ 0.7213\n\n    Finally, take the square root to find \"a\" (we take the positive root by convention):\n    a = sqrt(0.7213)\n    a ≈ 0.8493\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value a ≈ 0.8493 is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The information about the \"large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems\" is extra information. The normalization constant 'a' is a property of the wave function for a single particle and does not depend on the number of systems.\n*   A common mistake is to calculate ψ(x)² instead of |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x)ψ(x). Since the wave function is complex, this distinction is crucial.\n*   The limits of integration are explicitly defined by the physical constraint that the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3.\n*   Remember the basic rules of integration and logarithms to solve the definite integral correctly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
