    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, `S_y`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Formula for Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ>` is given by the formula:\n`<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`\nIn our case, the operator is `S_y` and the state is `|χ> = (3i, 4)`. So we need to calculate:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n\n**Step 2: Define the State Vector (ket) and its Conjugate Transpose (bra)**\n\n*   The given spin state is `(3i, 4)`. In column vector (ket) notation, this is:\n    `|χ> = [ 3i ]`\n    `      [ 4  ]`\n*   The corresponding bra vector, `<χ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|χ>`.\n    1.  Transpose `|χ>`: `[3i, 4]`\n    2.  Take the complex conjugate of each element: `[-3i, 4]`\n    So, `<χ| = [-3i, 4]`\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget to take the complex conjugate when forming the bra vector. Remember that `(i)* = -i`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Normalization Factor `<χ|χ>`**\n\nThis is the denominator in our expectation value formula.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [ 3i ]`\n`                  [ 4  ]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)*(3i) + (4)*(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16`\nSince `i² = -1`, we have:\n`<χ|χ> = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Careful Point:** The inner product of a state with itself, `<ψ|ψ>`, must always be a real, non-negative number. Our result of 25 confirms this.\n\n**Step 4: Define the Operator `S_y`**\n\nThe spin operator `S` is related to the Pauli matrices `σ` by `S = (ħ/2)σ`.\nTherefore, `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\nUsing the given `σ_y` matrix:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]`\n\n**Careful Point:** Do not forget the `ħ/2` factor. The Pauli matrices themselves are dimensionless, but the spin operator has units of angular momentum.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Numerator `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\n\nTo make the calculation easier, we first compute the action of the operator on the ket, `S_y|χ>`.\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]`\n`            [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) ]`\n`            [ (i)*(3i) + (0)*(4)  ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ 3i² ]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]`\n`            [ -3  ]`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\nLet's pull the constant `(ħ/2)` to the front:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ] )`\n`                                [ -3  ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3) )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( 12i² - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -12 - 12 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * ( -24 )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = -12ħ`\n\n**Careful Point:** Be very careful with the matrix multiplication and the arithmetic involving the imaginary unit `i`.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Answer**\n\nNow we combine the numerator and the denominator to find the expectation value:\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
