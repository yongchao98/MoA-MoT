    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the relationship between the substituents. The acetyl group is at position 1. The bromo group is at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group). The nitro group is at position 5 (also meta to the acetyl group). The bromo and nitro groups are meta to each other. This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative.\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is crucial, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new incoming groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** Deactivating (weakly) and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Correct reduction of a nitro group.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction does not work on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-). This complex is very strongly deactivating, preventing the acylation of the ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene → Bromobenzene:** Correct bromination.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene:** Correct nitration. The -Br group is an o,p-director, giving a mixture of ortho and para products, with para being the major one.\n*   **iii) 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group (-NO2). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not proceed on rings bearing a nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence fails at step (iii).\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.**\n*   **iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene:** This is a deamination reaction. Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is illogical for synthesizing the target molecule.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product, acetophenone, has a meta-directing acetyl group. This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct and high-yield.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** The ring now has a strong meta-director (-COCH3 at position 1) and a weak o,p-director (-Br at position 3). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group dominates, directing the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (position 5). This gives the desired target molecule. This is a known and effective transformation.\n*   **Steps iv) - vii):** These steps are performed on the final product. They involve reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence is nonsensical for the synthesis of the target molecule and appears to be included as a distractor. The synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii).\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, only sequence D provides a chemically sound and high-yield route to the target molecule in its first three steps. The other options contain steps that are either impossible under the given conditions or are logically flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
