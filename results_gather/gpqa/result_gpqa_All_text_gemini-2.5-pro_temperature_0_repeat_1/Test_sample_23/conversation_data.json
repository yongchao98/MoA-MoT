    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its general formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7.\n*   Mass % H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) = 0.1428 ≈ 1/7.\n*   So, y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n*   7y = 12x + y\n*   6y = 12x\n*   y = 2x\n*   The molecular formula of Z is of the form CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let's verify the mass percentage for C6H12: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is consistent with the given value. So, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both C and D, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say D is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Now we need to identify C. C must be a compound that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. Aromatic compounds fit this description. Benzene (C6H6) does not react with bromine water and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12).\n*   So, a plausible composition for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze mixture X and the reaction.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B are C6 cyclic compounds that can be hydrogenated to form a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The overall reaction is: A + B → C + D\n*   Substituting the identified compounds: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Since the reactants (A, B) and products (C, D) are all in equimolar ratios, we can balance the atoms.\n*   Total atoms in products = (C6H6) + (C6H12) = C12H18.\n*   Therefore, the total atoms in reactants must also be C12H18. So, A + B = C12H18.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   We are looking for two unsaturated, non-conjugated C6 cyclic compounds, A and B, whose elemental formulas sum to C12H18.\n*   The most common unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, so it is ruled out.\n*   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is not conjugated.\n*   Let's test the combination of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n*   Let's check the sum of their atoms: C6H10 + C6H8 = C12H18. This matches the products.\n*   The reaction is:\n    Cyclohexene (C6H10) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   In this reaction, cyclohexa-1,4-diene acts as a hydrogen donor (is oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as a hydrogen acceptor (is reduced to cyclohexane). This is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer, a type of disproportionation.\n*   This identification of A and B fits all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid A is cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
