    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). This process converts the mass of the initial particles into the mass and kinetic energy of the final particles. The reaction is:\n    $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information. In particle physics problems, this phrase usually implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is at rest (as in a fixed-target experiment) and the antiproton's velocity is close to zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is approximately zero ($\\vec{P}_{initial} \\approx 0$). This is the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the mass of each of these particles is the same: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total energy from the annihilation is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of these four particles.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles.\n    *   The relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$, and $v_A$ is the velocity of particle A.\n    *   Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero to conserve momentum. The simplest and most symmetric way for this to happen is for the energy to be distributed equally among the four final particles. This means they all will have the same speed, $v_A$.\n    *   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma_A (m_A c^2)$\n    Substituting the given value for $m_A c^2$:\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma_A (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma_A$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   We need to solve this equation for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma_A$ we found:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Initial State Approximation:** The interpretation of \"slowly moving\" is key. Assuming it means the initial kinetic energy is negligible simplifies the problem to an annihilation from rest, making the initial momentum zero and the initial energy purely rest mass energy.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The fundamental principles applied are the conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The particles produced are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) must be used.\n*   **Symmetry:** The problem asks for \"the velocity\", implying a single speed for all final particles. This is justified by the symmetry of the initial state (zero momentum) and the fact that all final particles have the same mass.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Initial Energy: $E_{in} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n2.  Final Energy: $E_{out} = 4 \\times \\gamma_A m_A c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma_A \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma_A \\text{ MeV}$.\n3.  Equate Energies: $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma_A \\implies \\gamma_A \\approx 1.5638$.\n4.  Calculate Velocity: $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma_A^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.5638)^2} \\approx 0.769$.\n5.  Result: $v_A \\approx 0.77c$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
