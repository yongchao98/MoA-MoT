    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it and the planet orbit their common center of mass. This wobble causes the star's light to be blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away. The amplitude of this periodic shift in wavelength is the key piece of information.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_s$) of the star: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_s}{c}$.\n    *   The maximum periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as $K_s$.\n    *   Therefore, $K_s$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We are given:\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom for planet #1's system.\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom for planet #2's system.\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude ($K_s$) and Orbital Period ($P$):**\n    *   The velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n        $K_s = \\frac{2 \\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{P}$\n        where $P$ is the orbital period, $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass, we have $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$, where $M_s$ and $m_p$ are the masses of the star and planet, and $a_p$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the planet's semi-major axis $a_p$ is nearly identical to the total separation $a$. So, we can write $a_s \\approx a \\frac{m_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period $P$ to the semi-major axis $a$:\n        $P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n        Solving for $a$, we get $a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_s + m_p) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$. This shows that $a$ is proportional to $P^{2/3}$ ($a \\propto P^{2/3}$), since $G$, $M_s$, and $m_p$ are constants for a given system.\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ back into the formula for $K_s$:\n        $K_s \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   We have established the key relationship: $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   This proportionality holds because other factors are constant between the two systems. The problem states that the star masses ($M_s$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are the same.\n    *   We must also assume that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same for both systems. In the absence of information to the contrary, this is a standard assumption for such comparative problems.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   Using the proportionality $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}}\\right)^3$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s1}}{K_{s2}}\\right)^3$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    *   Calculate the result:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes sense intuitively: a larger velocity wobble ($K_s$) for the same masses implies the planet is closer to the star, which, by Kepler's laws, means it must have a shorter orbital period. The result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
