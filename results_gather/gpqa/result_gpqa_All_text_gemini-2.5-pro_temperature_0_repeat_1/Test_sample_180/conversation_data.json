    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The question describes a hypothetical scenario where the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core stopped producing neutrinos about 8.5 minutes ago. All other nuclear reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) are assumed to continue normally.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Timing:** Neutrinos travel from the Sun to the Earth at nearly the speed of light. This journey takes approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Therefore, if a process in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the effects of that stoppage would be observable in the neutrino flux arriving at Earth *right now*.\n\n3.  **Identify the Affected Neutrino Source:** The pp-III branch is the source of Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos.\n    *   ³He + ⁴He → ⁷Be + γ\n    *   ⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ\n    *   **⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ**\n    The final step produces the ⁸B neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. The stoppage of the pp-III branch means there will be **no ⁸B neutrinos** in the flux we observe.\n\n4.  **Identify the Remaining Neutrino Sources in the Relevant Energy Range:** We need to determine which neutrinos contribute to the two specified energy bands, given that ⁸B neutrinos are absent.\n    *   **Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)**\n    *   **Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)**\n\n    Let's review the main solar neutrino sources:\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** Energy up to 420 keV. They do **not** contribute to either band.\n    *   **pep neutrinos:** Monoenergetic at 1.44 MeV. They do **not** contribute to either band.\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** Produced by the pp-II branch, which is still active. These are monoenergetic, with a very strong line at **861 keV**. This line falls squarely within **Band 2**.\n    *   **CNO neutrinos:** Produced by the CNO cycle, which is still active. These have continuous spectra (from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays) that extend up to ~1.7 MeV. They will contribute a continuous background flux to **both Band 1 and Band 2**.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Flux in Each Band:**\n    *   **Flux (Band 1):** The only source contributing to this band is the CNO cycle.\n        *   Flux (Band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)\n    *   **Flux (Band 2):** The sources are the very strong ⁷Be line and the CNO background.\n        *   Flux (Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be(861 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)\n\n6.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes:**\n    *   The key to solving the problem is comparing the magnitude of the ⁷Be neutrino flux to the CNO neutrino flux.\n    *   **Flux_⁷Be:** The flux from the 861 keV ⁷Be line is one of the largest components of the solar neutrino spectrum, with a value of approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second.\n    *   **Flux_CNO:** The CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's energy. The total flux of all CNO neutrinos is about 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second. This total flux is spread out over a continuous energy range of ~1.7 MeV.\n    *   The flux from CNO neutrinos within a small 100 keV band is only a small fraction of this total CNO flux.\n    *   Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is completely dominated by the ⁷Be line: Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux_⁷Be.\n    *   The flux in Band 1 is the small contribution from the CNO spectrum.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Approximate Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n    *   Ratio ≈ [Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)] / [Flux_⁷Be(861 keV)]\n    *   Let's perform an order-of-magnitude estimation. The total CNO flux (~5 x 10⁸) is about 1/10th of the total ⁷Be flux (~5 x 10⁹). However, the numerator (Flux in Band 1) is not the total CNO flux, but only the fraction of it that falls within a 100 keV window. Since the CNO spectrum spans over 1500 keV, the flux in a 100 keV window is roughly 1/15th of the total.\n    *   Numerator ≈ (Total CNO Flux) / 15 ≈ (5 x 10⁸) / 15 ≈ 3.3 x 10⁷\n    *   Denominator ≈ Total ⁷Be Flux ≈ 5 x 10⁹\n    *   Ratio ≈ (3.3 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.0066\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.0066. This value is on the order of 10⁻², which corresponds to the option 0.01.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The timing (8.5 minutes) is critical to establish that the change is currently observable.\n*   The problem hinges on knowing which neutrino comes from which reaction and its energy spectrum (line vs. continuous).\n*   The key insight is the vast difference in magnitude between the ⁷Be line flux and the CNO continuous flux.\n*   The specific energy bands are chosen to isolate the strong ⁷Be line in Band 2, making the flux in Band 2 much larger than in Band 1.\n*   The problem asks for an *approximate* ratio, so an order-of-magnitude calculation is sufficient and appropriate.\n\nThe flux in Band 2 is dominated by the ⁷Be line, which has a flux on the order of 10⁹. The flux in Band 1 consists only of CNO neutrinos, and the flux in this small energy window is on the order of 10⁷. The ratio is therefore on the order of 10⁷ / 10⁹ = 10⁻² = 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
