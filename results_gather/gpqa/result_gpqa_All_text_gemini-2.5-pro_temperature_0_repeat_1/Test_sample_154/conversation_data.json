    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Uncertainty**\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nwhere:\n*   $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n*   $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\nFor our problem, we need to calculate $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$.\n\n**3. Identify the Given Information**\n*   **Operator $P_z$:** The matrix form of $P_z$ is given as:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   **State of the System $|\\psi\\rangle$:** The state is given as a column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   **Basis:** The problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. This is a crucial piece of information. It means the matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, and the diagonal elements are its eigenvalues.\n\n**4. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Normalization of the state:** Before performing calculations, it's good practice to ensure the state vector is normalized, i.e., $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = 1$.\n    The corresponding bra vector is $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (-1/2)^*(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})^*(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1/2)^*(-1/2)$\n    $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\n    The state is indeed normalized.\n*   **Meaning of the state vector components:** Since the basis is the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are the probability amplitudes for finding the system in the corresponding eigenstates of $P_z$.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Method 1: Direct Matrix Multiplication**\n\n**Step 4.1: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\nFirst, we compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n**Step 4.2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we compute the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n**Method 2: Using Eigenvalues and Probabilities (Often simpler)**\n\nSince the basis is the eigenbasis of $P_z$, we can identify the eigenvalues and the probabilities of measuring them.\n*   The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are the diagonal elements: $p_1 = \\hbar$, $p_2 = 0$, $p_3 = -\\hbar$.\n*   The state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a superposition: $|\\psi\\rangle = c_1|p_1\\rangle + c_2|p_2\\rangle + c_3|p_3\\rangle$.\n*   The coefficients are the components of the vector: $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, $c_3 = -1/2$.\n*   The probability of measuring eigenvalue $p_i$ is $P(p_i) = |c_i|^2$.\n    *   $P(\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n    *   $P(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n    *   $P(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n\n**Step 4.1 (Method 2): Calculate $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i P(p_i) = (\\hbar)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (-\\hbar)(1/4) = \\hbar/4 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n**Step 4.2 (Method 2): Calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i^2 P(p_i) = (\\hbar)^2(1/4) + (0)^2(1/2) + (-\\hbar)^2(1/4) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\nBoth methods yield the same results for the expectation values.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow we plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
