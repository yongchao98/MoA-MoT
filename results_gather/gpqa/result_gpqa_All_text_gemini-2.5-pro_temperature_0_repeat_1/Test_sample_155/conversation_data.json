    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a C2 rotational axis of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process that results in anti-dihydroxylation.\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs a syn-addition epoxidation across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide via an S_N2-like attack by water, which is an anti-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of a syn-epoxidation followed by an anti-ring-opening is equivalent to an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry is that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   Mnemonic: **T**rans + **A**nti -> **M**eso (TAM).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid produces meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound. Let's call this compound **M**. (Its specific configuration is (4R, 5S) or (4S, 5R), which are identical for a meso compound).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Mnemonic: **C**is + **A**nti -> **R**acemic (CAR).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid produces a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are two distinct, chiral compounds that are enantiomers of each other. Let's call them **R** and **S**, respectively. They are produced in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **R**: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **S**: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (**M** vs. **R** and **M** vs. **S**) have different physical properties and will therefore have different retention times. They will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Enantiomers (**R** vs. **S**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will have the same retention time and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (**M**)\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (**R** + **S**)\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will separate the diastereomers (**M** from **R** and **S**) and also the enantiomers (**R** from **S**).\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral HPLC will show **three peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (**M**)\n        *   Peak 2: One enantiomer (e.g., **R**)\n        *   Peak 3: The other enantiomer (e.g., **S**)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  Correctly identify the overall reaction as an anti-dihydroxylation.\n2.  Apply the correct stereochemical rules for anti-addition to cis and trans alkenes. (Trans -> Meso, Cis -> Racemic).\n3.  Understand the composition of the final mixture (one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers).\n4.  Know the separation capabilities of both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC. Achiral columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers. Chiral columns separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Reaction 1 Product: 1 compound (meso-diol)\n*   Reaction 2 Product: 2 compounds (racemic pair of enantiomeric diols)\n*   Total Mixture: 3 stereoisomers (1 meso, 2 enantiomers)\n*   Standard HPLC: Separates diastereomers -> 2 peaks (meso peak, enantiomer pair peak)\n*   Chiral HPLC: Separates all stereoisomers -> 3 peaks (meso peak, R-enantiomer peak, S-enantiomer peak)\n\n<<<C>>>"
