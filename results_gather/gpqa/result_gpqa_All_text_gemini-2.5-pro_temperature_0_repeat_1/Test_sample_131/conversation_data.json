    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options. We need to consider chemical equivalence due to molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other and will couple, producing a complex signal (an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent (6H), and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by CH2). The signals are **not singlets**.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate candidates based on the NMR data**\n\nWe can use the provided spectral data as filters to rule out compounds that do not fit.\n\n*   **Filter 1: Alkyl signals are all singlets.**\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and a triplet in its alkyl region. This compound is therefore **eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n*   **Filter 2: Aromatic signals are singlets.**\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) has an AB quartet in its aromatic region, not singlets. This compound is therefore **eliminated**. This rules out options C and D.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct pair and verify the mixture's spectrum**\n\nThe only two compounds remaining after the elimination process are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**. This corresponds to option B. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the given data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of Durene and Isodurene.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states there are three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be achieved if the two 3H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak.\n    *   The three resulting signals would be:\n        1.  12H singlet (from Durene)\n        2.  6H singlet (from C2/C3 methyls of Isodurene)\n        3.  6H singlet (from the overlap of C1 and C5 methyls of Isodurene)\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet of 2H.\n    *   Isodurene contributes two singlets, each of 1H.\n    *   The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2H (from Durene) + 2H (from Isodurene) = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio for 4H corresponds to two signals, each with an integration of 2H.\n    *   This can be achieved if the two 1H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally degenerate, appearing as a single 2H peak.\n    *   The two resulting signals would be:\n        1.  2H singlet (from Durene)\n        2.  2H singlet (from the overlap of H-4 and H-6 of Isodurene)\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. This matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
