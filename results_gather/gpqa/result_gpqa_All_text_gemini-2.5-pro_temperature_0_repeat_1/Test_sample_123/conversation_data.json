    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the required Lorentz factor.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Particle Decay:**\n    The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The number of particles, N, remaining at a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is given by:\n    N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)\n    Here, 't' is the time measured in the particle's own rest frame (this is called the proper time), and 'τ' is the mean proper lifetime of the particle, a constant for a given particle type.\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Frame and Particle's Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    The problem is described from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the wall of the detector in the lab frame is `t_lab`.\n    However, due to time dilation from special relativity, the time experienced by the fast-moving particle (its proper time, `t_proper`) is shorter. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time of Flight in the Lab Frame:**\n    The particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, R = 30 m. They are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    So, the time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Concepts for the First Scenario:**\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n    *   Fraction of particles reaching the wall is 1/3. This means N/N₀ = 1/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₁ = t_lab / γ₁ ≈ (R/c) / γ₁`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `1/3 = e^(-t_proper₁ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₁ * τ)))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the First Scenario Equation:**\n    To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `-ln(3) = - (R / (c * γ₁ * τ))`\n    `ln(3) = R / (c * γ₁ * τ)`\n    This equation relates the known `γ₁` to the unknown constants `R`, `c`, and `τ`. We can rearrange it to find an expression for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₁ * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Equation for the Second Scenario:**\n    *   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the wall is 2/3. So, N/N₀ = 2/3.\n    *   The proper time for this scenario is `t_proper₂ = t_lab / γ₂ ≈ (R/c) / γ₂`.\n    *   Plugging this into the decay equation:\n        `2/3 = e^(-t_proper₂ / τ) = e^(-(R / (c * γ₂ * τ)))`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Second Scenario Equation and Solve for γ₂:**\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    Using the property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`:\n    `-ln(3/2) = - (R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    `ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`\n    Rearranging for the constant group `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `R / (c * τ) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n8.  **Equate the Expressions and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    We now have two different expressions for the same constant group `R / (c * τ)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₁ * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    We can now solve for the unknown `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n    Now, substitute the known value `γ₁ = 20`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n    Using the approximate values for the logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Proper Time:** The most critical point is to use the proper time (`t_proper`) in the exponential decay formula, not the lab time (`t_lab`).\n*   **Time Dilation:** Correctly applying the time dilation formula `t_proper = t_lab / γ` is essential. A higher Lorentz factor `γ` means the particle experiences less time, and therefore less decay.\n*   **Constant Grouping:** Realizing that `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constants allows you to solve the problem without needing their specific values. The ratio of the two scenarios cancels them out.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have more particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay less. For a fixed travel distance, this means they must experience less proper time. This requires a *higher* Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is higher than `γ₁ = 20`, which makes physical sense.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.18, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
