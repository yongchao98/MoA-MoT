    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic C10 hydrocarbon cage with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions. Its formula is C10H14Br2.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, basic conditions.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2H + 10H + 2H = 14 protons. This means the C10H14 skeleton is retained.\n    *   The formula of Product 1 is therefore C10H14O.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The formula C10H14O for a molecule derived from the tricyclic adamantane framework (which has 3 degrees of unsaturation) implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4). These are accounted for by 3 rings and 1 C=O group. This means Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone. The most plausible and stable ketone with a C10 adamantane-type skeleton is **adamantan-2-one** (also known as tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decan-2-one). While the mechanism for its formation from 1,3-dibromoadamantane is complex (involving hydrolysis and rearrangement), the product data strongly points to this structure. The provided NMR data is a simplified representation of its spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction specifically reduces ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group in adamantan-2-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Therefore, Product 2 is **adamantan-2-ol**. Its formula is C10H16O.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** The reagent combination (O₃ followed by DMS) is characteristic of an ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). However, Product 2, adamantan-2-ol, is a saturated alcohol and contains no C=C bonds. This suggests that the ozone is performing a different, less common reaction. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent and is known to oxidize C-H bonds, particularly tertiary C-H bonds.\n*   Adamantan-2-ol has four tertiary C-H bonds at the bridgehead positions (C1, C3, C5, and C7). The reaction with ozone will oxidize one of these bridgehead C-H bonds to a C-OH group.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The reaction will form a diol of adamantane. For example, if the C-H bond at position C5 is oxidized, the product is **adamantane-2,5-diol**. The exact position of the second hydroxyl group (C1, C5, or C7) does not affect the analysis of the target proton.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identification of the Proton:** The protons that exchange with deuterated solvent are the -OH protons. We are interested in the C-H protons. The most deshielded C-H protons are those attached to carbons bearing an electronegative atom like oxygen. In adamantane-2,x-diol, the proton on C2 (H-C2) is attached to a carbon bearing a hydroxyl group and is typically the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine how many neighboring protons the H-C2 proton is coupled to.\n    *   The C2 carbon in the adamantane cage is bonded to two other carbons: the bridgehead C1 and the bridgehead C3.\n    *   Both C1 and C3 are tertiary carbons, each bearing one proton (H-C1 and H-C3).\n    *   Therefore, the H-C2 proton is coupled to two neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the adamantane cage relative to the C2 position, the two neighboring protons (H-C1 and H-C3) are in equivalent chemical environments. They will have the same coupling constant (J) to H-C2.\n*   **Determining the Splitting Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons is split into a signal with (n+1) peaks. In this case, n=2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for H-C2 will be split into a (2+1) = 3 peak pattern. This pattern is called a **triplet**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
