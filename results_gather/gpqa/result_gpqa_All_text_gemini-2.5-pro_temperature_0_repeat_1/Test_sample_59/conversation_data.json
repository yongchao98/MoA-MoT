    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Concept:** The problem involves comparing the passage of time for a moving observer (the astronaut) with that of a stationary observer (on Earth). This is a classic application of the theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**. The time experienced by the astronaut will be shorter than the time measured from Earth.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference and Variables:**\n    *   **Rest Frame (Earth's Frame):** The frame of reference in which the Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are considered stationary.\n        *   `d`: The distance from the LMC to Earth.\n        *   `Δt`: The time taken for the journey as measured from Earth.\n    *   **Moving Frame (Astronaut's Frame):** The frame of reference of the spacecraft.\n        *   `v`: The speed of the spacecraft, given as `0.99999987 * c`.\n        *   `Δt₀`: The time taken for the journey as measured by the astronaut (this is what the question asks for).\n\n3.  **Gather Necessary Data:**\n    *   **Speed (v):** `v = 0.99999987 * c`.\n    *   **Distance (d):** The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is not given in the problem. We must use a standard astronomical value. A commonly accepted approximate distance is **159,000 light-years**. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.\n\n4.  **List the Relevant Formulas:**\n    *   The relationship between time in the rest frame and the moving frame is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The term `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   The time of travel in the Earth's frame is calculated using the basic formula: `Δt = d / v`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Part A: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n        *   First, find `v/c`: `v/c = 0.99999987`.\n        *   Next, calculate `(v/c)²`: `(0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974`.\n        *   Now, find `1 - (v/c)²`: `1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026`.\n        *   Take the square root: `sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099`.\n        *   Finally, calculate `γ`: `γ = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16`.\n        *   This means that for every 1 year that passes for the astronaut, about 1961 years pass on Earth.\n\n    *   **Part B: Calculate the Travel Time in Earth's Frame (Δt)**\n        *   `d = 159,000 light-years`\n        *   `v = 0.99999987 * c`\n        *   `Δt = d / v = 159,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)`\n        *   Since a light-year is `c * 1 year`, we can write: `Δt = (159,000 * c * years) / (0.99999987 * c)`.\n        *   The `c` terms cancel out: `Δt = 159,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 159,000.02` years.\n        *   As measured from Earth, the journey takes just over 159,000 years.\n\n    *   **Part C: Calculate the Travel Time in the Astronaut's Frame (Δt₀)**\n        *   We rearrange the time dilation formula: `Δt₀ = Δt / γ`.\n        *   `Δt₀ = 159,000.02 years / 1961.16`\n        *   `Δt₀ ≈ 81.07` years.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and Verification:**\n    *   The time that passes for the astronaut during the journey is approximately **81 years**.\n    *   The astronaut starts at age 22. Upon arrival, their age will be `22 + 81 = 103` years.\n    *   The average lifespan of the aliens is 150 years. Since `103 < 150`, the astronaut will survive the journey. This rules out option C.\n    *   The calculated value of ~81 years matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Time Dilation is Key:** The core of the problem is recognizing that time passes differently for the moving astronaut due to their high speed.\n*   **External Data:** The distance to the LMC is required information. Using a standard value like 159,000 or 160,000 light-years is necessary. The choice of this value can slightly alter the final number, but it should point clearly to one of the options. The value of 159,000 light-years leads directly to the answer of 81 years.\n*   **Precision:** The speed is very close to the speed of light, leading to a large Lorentz factor. Accurate calculation is important.\n*   **Check for Survival:** The information about the astronaut's age and lifespan is crucial to verify if the journey is possible within their lifetime, which helps eliminate one of the options.\n\nThe final answer is the time elapsed for the astronaut, which is approximately 81 years.\n\n<<<B>>>"
