    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the State and Parameters**\n\n*   The Schrödinger cat state is given by: `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n*   The normalization constant is: `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n*   The given parameters are `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\nFirst, let's specify the state with these parameters:\n*   `cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25`\n*   `exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-2 * 0.25) = exp(-0.5)`\n\nNow, substitute these into the state and normalization constant:\n*   `N^2 = 1 + (-1) * exp(-0.5) = 1 - exp(-0.5)`\n*   `|psi> = ( (1/sqrt(2))|alpha> - (1/sqrt(2))|-alpha> ) / N = (1 / (sqrt(2) * N)) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`\n\nThis is a pure quantum state. The density matrix for this state is `rho = |psi><psi|`.\n\n**2. Understand the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\n*   The measure is given by the relative entropy: `del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`\n*   This can be rewritten in terms of the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X * ln(X))`.\n*   `del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Entropy of the State `rho`**\n\n*   `rho` is the density matrix of a pure state `|psi>`.\n*   The von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\n*   `S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho)) = 0`.\n*   Therefore, the non-Gaussianity measure simplifies to `del_b = S(tau)`.\n\n**4. Identify the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\n*   `tau` is the reference Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the state `rho`.\n*   **First Moment (Mean displacement):** We need to calculate `<a_rho> = trace(rho * a) = <psi|a|psi>`.\n    *   `a|psi> = a * (1 / (sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>) = (1 / (sqrt(2)N)) * (alpha|alpha> + alpha|-alpha>) = (alpha / (sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> + |-alpha>)`\n    *   `<psi|a|psi> = < (1/(sqrt(2)N)) * (<alpha| - <-alpha|) | (alpha/(sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> + |-alpha>) >`\n    *   `<psi|a|psi> = (alpha / (2N^2)) * (<alpha|alpha> + <alpha|-alpha> - <-alpha|alpha> - <-alpha|-alpha>)`\n    *   Using `<beta|gamma> = exp(-|beta|^2/2 - |gamma|^2/2 + beta*gamma)`, we get `<alpha|-alpha> = <-alpha|alpha> = exp(-2*alpha^2)`.\n    *   `<psi|a|psi> = (alpha / (2N^2)) * (1 + exp(-2a^2) - exp(-2a^2) - 1) = 0`.\n    *   The first moment is zero, so `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n\n*   **Second Moments:** We need `<a^2_rho>` and `<a_dagger a_rho>`.\n    *   `<a^2_rho> = <psi|a^2|psi>`. Since `a^2|alpha> = alpha^2|alpha>` and `a^2|-alpha> = (-alpha)^2|-alpha> = alpha^2|-alpha>`, we find that `a^2|psi> = alpha^2|psi>`. Thus, `|psi>` is an eigenstate of `a^2`.\n    *   `<a^2_rho> = <psi|alpha^2|psi> = alpha^2<psi|psi> = alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n    *   `<n_rho> = <a_dagger a_rho> = <psi|a_dagger a|psi> = ||a|psi>||^2`.\n    *   From the first moment calculation, `a|psi> = (alpha / (sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> + |-alpha>)`.\n    *   `<n_rho> = || (alpha / (sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> + |-alpha>) ||^2 = (alpha^2 / (2N^2)) * <(alpha+ -alpha)|(alpha+ -alpha)>`\n    *   `<n_rho> = (alpha^2 / (2N^2)) * (1 + 2exp(-2a^2) + 1) = (alpha^2 / N^2) * (1 + exp(-2a^2))`\n    *   Substituting `N^2 = 1 - exp(-2a^2)`, we get `<n_rho> = alpha^2 * (1 + exp(-2a^2)) / (1 - exp(-2a^2)) = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of the Gaussian State `tau`**\n\n*   The entropy of a centered single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is determined by its covariance matrix `V`. The entropy is given by `S(tau) = g(sqrt(det(V)))`, where `g(x) = (x+1/2)ln(x+1/2) - (x-1/2)ln(x-1/2)`.\n*   The elements of the covariance matrix are determined by the second moments. For a centered state:\n    *   `V_xx = <n_rho> + Re(<a^2_rho>) + 1/2`\n    *   `V_pp = <n_rho> - Re(<a^2_rho>) + 1/2`\n*   Using our calculated moments:\n    *   `<a^2_rho> = alpha^2 = 0.25` (real)\n    *   `<n_rho> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n    *   `coth(0.25) = (e^{0.25} + e^{-0.25}) / (e^{0.25} - e^{-0.25}) ≈ 4.083`\n    *   `<n_rho> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`\n*   Now we find the determinant of the covariance matrix:\n    *   `det(V) = V_xx * V_pp = (<n_rho> + 1/2)^2 - (Re(<a^2_rho>))^2`\n    *   `det(V) = (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2 = (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625`\n    *   `det(V) ≈ 2.3127 - 0.0625 = 2.2502`\n*   Now, let `nu = sqrt(det(V))`:\n    *   `nu ≈ sqrt(2.2502) ≈ 1.50007`\n*   This value is extremely close to 1.5. For small `alpha`, `det(V)` approaches `(3/2)^2 = 2.25`. We can approximate `nu = 1.5`.\n*   Finally, calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n    *   `S(tau) = g(1.5) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, we have `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`.\n    *   Using `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`, we get `S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.693 = 1.386`.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity is `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) = 1.386 - 0 = 1.386`.\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 0.25\nC) 1.38\nD) 2.48\n\nThe calculated value `1.386` is closest to `1.38`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
