    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape and a symmetry axis along the z-axis. An oscillating charge distribution is a source of electromagnetic radiation. The simplest and most common model for such a source, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of radiation, is an oscillating electric dipole. The symmetry of the spheroid and the oscillation along the z-axis imply that the electric dipole moment vector, **p**, oscillates along the z-axis. We can write it as **p**(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) **ẑ**, where **ẑ** is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone (far-field) for an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² c) * sin²(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `θ` is the angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis in this case).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence:**\n    *   The formula shows that the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   The problem states that this maximum radiated power is `A`.\n    *   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = (Constant) * sin²(90°) = (Constant) * 1`.\n    *   This means we can express the power at any angle `θ` in terms of `A`:\n        `dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:**\n    *   We need to find the value of `dP/dΩ` at `θ = 30°`.\n    *   Using the expression from the previous step:\n        `(dP/dΩ)_θ=30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   So, the power radiated at `θ = 30°` is `A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n    *   The fraction of `A` radiated at this angle is **1/4**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    *   The question asks for a possible form of the function `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`. We need to find how it depends on the wavelength `λ`.\n    *   Let's look at the original formula again: `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`, where `ν` is the frequency.\n    *   Substituting this into the proportionality:\n        `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    *   Thus, the radiated power per unit solid angle is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This is the famous result for Rayleigh scattering.\n    *   A possible form for the `λ` dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n6.  **Combine the Results and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   The dependence on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n    *   Matching these two results with the given options:\n        A) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n        B) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n        C) 1/4, λ⁻³\n        D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n    *   Option B correctly matches both parts of our analysis.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Model Assumption:** The key is to model the oscillating spheroid as a simple electric dipole. This is the lowest-order multipole radiation and is the dominant form of radiation unless it is forbidden by some symmetry (which is not the case here).\n*   **Angular Factor:** The angular distribution of power for dipole radiation is `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is measured from the axis of the dipole. The maximum is at `θ = 90°`, not `θ = 0°`.\n*   **Squaring the Sine:** A common mistake is to forget to square the value of `sin(30°)`. `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`, not 1/2.\n*   **Frequency vs. Wavelength:** The power is proportional to `ω⁴`. It is crucial to correctly convert this to a dependence on `λ` using `ω ∝ 1/λ`, which leads to the `λ⁻⁴` relationship.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is 1/4, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
