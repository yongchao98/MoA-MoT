    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    The problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In vector notation using spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that bounds the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Here, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    We will now calculate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, which is the flux of the field `f` through the surface of the sphere.\n    *   **Field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Surface element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` also points in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, it is given by `dS = (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Dot product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n        Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ`\n    *   **Integrate over the surface:** To find the total flux, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are from 0 to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are from 0 to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sinθ dθ dφ`\n        We can separate the integrals:\n        `= (∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ) * (∫_{θ=0}^{π} sinθ dθ)`\n        Evaluating each integral:\n        `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π`\n        `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n        Multiplying the results:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral of the flux. Therefore:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Singularity at the Origin:** The vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r=0`).\n2.  **Divergence Calculation:** If one were to naively calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` for `r > 0` using the formula in spherical coordinates, the result would be `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`. This might lead to the incorrect conclusion that the integral is zero.\n3.  **Why the Divergence Theorem Works:** The Divergence Theorem is the correct tool precisely because of this singularity. The singularity acts as a \"source\" of the field. The theorem correctly quantifies the total \"source strength\" inside the volume by measuring the total flux flowing out through its boundary. The divergence of this field is technically a Dirac delta function at the origin, `∇ ⋅ f = 4πδ³(r)`, and the integral of this over the volume containing the origin is `4π`. The surface integral is the most direct way to arrive at this result without using delta functions.\n4.  **Independence of Radius R:** Notice that the final answer `4π` does not depend on the radius `R` of the sphere. This is a characteristic feature of fields that fall off as `1/r^2`. The `R^2` term from the surface area element `dS` always cancels the `1/R^2` term from the field's magnitude.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`. Comparing this with the given options, the most appropriate choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
