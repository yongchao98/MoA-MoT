    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Mᵧ is the molar mass of Y and n is the number of fluorine atoms. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M_F) / (Mᵧ + n × M_F)\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (Mᵧ + n × 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Mᵧ:\nMᵧ = (n × 19.00 / 0.3196) - (n × 19.00)\nMᵧ = n × (59.449 - 19.00)\nMᵧ ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can now test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y:\n*   n=1: Mᵧ ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar, K - unlikely to form five binary fluorides).\n*   n=2: Mᵧ ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br, Se - let's check BrF₂. M(BrF₂) = 79.9 + 38 = 117.9. ɷF = 38/117.9 = 32.2%. This is a possibility. However, BrF₂ is a radical). Let's check KrF₂. M(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol. M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 38 = 121.8. ɷF = 38/121.8 = 31.2%. This is also a possibility.\n*   n=3: Mᵧ ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb). Let's check SbF₃. M(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol. M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 57 = 178.76. ɷF = 57/178.76 = 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=4: Mᵧ ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Tb, Dy - unlikely).\n*   n=5: Mᵧ ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Bi, Pb, Hg - let's check BiF₅. M(Bi)=209. ɷF = 95/(209+95) = 31.25%).\n*   n=6: Mᵧ ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu, Am). Let's check PuF₆. M(Pu)=244. ɷF = 114/(244+114) = 31.84%. This is also a very close match.\n\nThe best candidates for (Y, A2) based on mass fraction are (Sb, SbF₃), (Pu, PuF₆), and (Kr, KrF₂).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the chemical reactions to identify the correct element and compounds.**\n\nLet's analyze the given reactions for each candidate. The most restrictive clue is the 1:1 comproportionation reaction: Y + A4 → A5.\n\n*   **Case 1: Y = Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   A2 = SbF₃.\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ implies A1 = SbF₅.\n    *   The comproportionation reaction would be Sb + A4 → A5. For this to be a comproportionation, A4 must be SbF₅. The known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.\n\n*   **Case 2: Y = Plutonium (Pu)**\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ and the fact that PuF₆ is the highest known fluoride suggests a possible error in the problem statement. If we assume A1=PuF₆ decomposes to A2=PuF₄, the mass fraction of A2 is wrong. If we assume A2=PuF₆, then A1 is a hypothetical PuF₈.\n    *   Let's check the comproportionation. Known reactions are 2Pu + PuF₆ → 3PuF₄ and Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃. Neither has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This hypothesis fails.\n\n*   **Case 3: Y = Krypton (Kr)**\n    *   A2 = KrF₂ (ɷF = 31.2%, which is reasonably close to 31.96%).\n    *   The decomposition A1 → A2 + F₂ implies A1 = KrF₄. The reaction KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂ is known; KrF₄ is highly unstable. This fits.\n    *   A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizer and can oxidize xenon. This fits.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Kr (Y). Kr + F₂ → KrF₂. So A3 = KrF₂. This fits.\n    *   Now, the key reaction: Y + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n        *   Let's test this: Kr + A4 → A5. For a comproportionation, A4 must be a higher fluoride. The only other known fluoride is KrF₄.\n        *   The reaction is: Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂.\n        *   This reaction proceeds with a 1:1 molar ratio of Krypton (Y) and Krypton tetrafluoride (A4). This is a perfect match for the description.\n    *   Therefore, we can identify A4 = KrF₄ and A5 = KrF₂.\n    *   The problem states A4 is in a \"colorless concentrated solution\". KrF₄ is a white solid, and its solution in a solvent like anhydrous HF would likely be colorless. This is plausible.\n    *   The final clue: A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water. KrF₂ + H₂O → Kr + ½O₂ + 2HF. This produces two gaseous substances (Kr and O₂), fitting the description.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude and calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis is the only one that provides a consistent explanation for the chemical reactions described, especially the unique 1:1 comproportionation. The discrepancies in the problem (the \"five compounds\", the \"bright-red\" color of A1, and the slight error in mass fraction for A2) are likely errors or red herrings.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n*   Substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄):\nM(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00\nM(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated molecular weight to the given ranges.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We check which range this value falls into:\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.80 is within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>"
