    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction occurs at the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction introduces a single bromine atom at one of the α-positions. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** NaOH (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base. Two major pathways are possible:\n    1.  **Elimination (Dehydrohalogenation):** The base removes a proton from the β-carbon (C3), leading to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-enone.\n    2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The base removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The nucleophilic base (OH⁻) then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained cyclopropane ring. This results in a ring contraction, forming a cyclopentanecarboxylate salt, which upon workup gives a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Which pathway is correct?** We must look at the subsequent reactions to decide. The reagent in Step 4, Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, is a very specific and mild reducing agent, famously used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes. This strongly suggests that Product 3 is an acyl chloride, which in turn means Product 2 must be a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the **Favorskii rearrangement** is the intended pathway.\n*   **Product 2:** The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone yields **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms?**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. It consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C-C bond connecting it to the ring, the C1 carbon of the ring, its attached hydrogen, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens:** We look for protons that are in unique chemical environments.\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the proton on the carbon of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group. It is a methine proton and is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center. This means they are chemically non-equivalent. Let's call them H_a and H_b. The H_a protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the H_b protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct types of protons for these four hydrogens. (2 types)\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of protons for these four hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n    *   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n    *   Type 3: C2/C5-H_a (2H)\n    *   Type 4: C2/C5-H_b (2H)\n    *   Type 5: C3/C4-H_a (2H)\n    *   Type 6: C3/C4-H_b (2H)\n\nSumming these up, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
