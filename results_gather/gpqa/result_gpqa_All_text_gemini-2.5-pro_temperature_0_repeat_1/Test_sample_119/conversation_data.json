    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the fundamental assumptions and definitions.**\n\n*   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant number density 'ρ' (rho).\n    *   `ρ = Number of stars / Volume = constant`\n*   **Definition:** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This implies `d = 1/plx`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of stars up to a certain distance.**\n\n*   Consider a sphere of radius 'd' centered on the observer (Earth). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n*   The total number of stars, `N`, within this sphere is the product of the constant density `ρ` and the volume `V`.\n    *   `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n*   This shows that the total number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N(d) ∝ d³`.\n\n**Step 3: Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n\n*   The question is about parallax, so we need to replace the distance 'd' with parallax 'plx' using the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n*   A star at a distance 'd' has a parallax of `plx = 1/d`. Any star that is closer than 'd' will have a parallax that is *larger* than `plx`.\n*   Therefore, the number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to a certain value `plx`, let's call it `N(≥plx)`, is equal to the number of stars within the corresponding distance `d = 1/plx`.\n*   Substituting `d = 1/plx` into our expression for `N(d)`:\n    *   `N(≥plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`\n*   So, the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than `plx` is proportional to `1/plx³`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*.**\n\n*   The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes. This is a differential quantity, not the cumulative number we just calculated. We are looking for the number of stars in a small parallax interval, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`, divided by the width of that interval, `d(plx)`.\n*   Mathematically, this is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(≥plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this quantity `n(plx)`.\n    *   `n(plx) = |dN(≥plx) / d(plx)|`\n    *   We use the absolute value because `N(≥plx)` decreases as `plx` increases (we are looking at a smaller volume of space), but the number of stars in an interval must be a positive quantity.\n*   Let's perform the differentiation:\n    *   `N(≥plx) = C * plx⁻³` (where `C = 4πρ/3` is a constant)\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx⁻³]`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3) * plx⁻⁴ = -3C / plx⁴`\n*   Taking the absolute value:\n    *   `n(plx) = |-3C / plx⁴| = 3C / plx⁴`\n*   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n1.  **Uniform Density:** The entire result hinges on the assumption that `ρ` is constant. In reality, this is not perfectly true (e.g., due to the structure of the Milky Way galaxy), but it's the premise of the question.\n2.  **Cumulative vs. Differential:** A common mistake is to stop at Step 3 and conclude the answer is `1/plx³`. It's crucial to understand that \"number of stars per unit range\" implies a density or a derivative (`dN/d(plx)`), not the total count (`N`).\n3.  **Inverse Relationship:** Remember that a larger parallax means a smaller distance. This is why `N(≥plx)` corresponds to the number of stars *within* a certain distance.\n4.  **The Power Rule of Differentiation:** The key mathematical step is differentiating `x⁻³`, which gives `-3x⁻⁴`. This change in the exponent from -3 to -4 is what leads to the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`n(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
