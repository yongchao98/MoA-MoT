    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the observations from the experimental data.**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** A small, chemically synthesized peptidic compound. This is important because peptides are polymers of amino acids linked by amide bonds. They possess chiral centers (the alpha-carbons, usually L-configuration) and amide bonds that have restricted rotation.\n*   **¹H NMR Observation 1:** Two peaks for a single alpha-proton. In a single, pure, conformationally rigid compound, a single proton should give only one signal (which may be split by coupling). Seeing two signals for one proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n*   **¹H NMR Observation 2:** The two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, summing to one proton. The similar chemical shifts suggest the two environments are structurally very similar. The equal integrals indicate that the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n*   **¹H NMR Observation 3:** Spin-spin coupling is ruled out. This confirms the two peaks are not part of a single multiplet (like a doublet) but are two distinct signals (e.g., two singlets, or two doublets if the alpha-proton is coupled to another proton).\n*   **LC-MS Observation 1:** Two clearly defined peaks in the LC (Liquid Chromatography). LC separates compounds based on their physical/chemical properties (like polarity). Two peaks mean there are two distinct chemical species that are stable enough to be separated on the timescale of the chromatography experiment.\n*   **LC-MS Observation 2:** The two LC peaks have equal intensities. This confirms the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n*   **LC-MS Observation 3:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. This is a critical piece of information. It means the two species are **isomers** – they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the provided options against the consolidated observations.**\n\nThe evidence points to a ~1:1 mixture of two isomers of the target peptide. Let's see which option fits.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.**\n    *   A precursor is a starting material or intermediate. It would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass than the final product.\n    *   This contradicts the MS data, which shows both species have the same mass as the expected product. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.**\n    *   This refers to a side reaction where an extra amino acid is accidentally inserted into the peptide chain. The resulting molecule would be larger than the expected product.\n    *   This contradicts the MS data, as the product of double coupling would have a higher mass. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral (non-chiral) environment.\n    *   Standard ¹H NMR and standard LC are achiral techniques. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would produce only a single signal in the NMR and a single peak in the LC. To separate them, you would need a chiral NMR solvent/reagent or a chiral LC column.\n    *   This contradicts the observation of two distinct peaks in both the NMR and the LC. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Because they are different compounds, they can be separated by standard LC, which would explain the two LC peaks.\n    *   Because they have different 3D structures, corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton in question) are in different chemical environments and will have different chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum, explaining the two NMR signals.\n    *   Because they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass, which explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n    *   **How could this happen in a peptide?** There are two very common ways:\n        1.  **Epimerization:** During synthesis, one of the chiral alpha-carbons could have inverted its stereochemistry (e.g., an L-amino acid becomes a D-amino acid). The resulting L,L,D... peptide is a diastereomer of the intended L,L,L... peptide. If this happens to ~50% of the material, it would result in a 1:1 mixture.\n        2.  **Cis-Trans Isomerism:** The amide bond (peptide bond) has restricted rotation. It can exist in either a *cis* or *trans* conformation. While *trans* is usually heavily favored, the barrier to rotation around the bond preceding a proline residue is much lower, and both *cis* and *trans* isomers can exist in significant, comparable amounts at room temperature. These two rotational isomers (rotamers) are diastereomers of each other, and they interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, giving rise to two sets of peaks.\n    *   This option is consistent with all the experimental observations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presence of two separable species with identical mass but different NMR spectra is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
