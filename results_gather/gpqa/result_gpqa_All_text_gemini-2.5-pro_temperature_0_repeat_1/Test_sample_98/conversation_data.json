    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The peak is very broad due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct for all candidates.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This tells us there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four candidate structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so they are all consistent with this observation.\n*   **A signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a complex splitting pattern. For a signal to be a `dtq`, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (gives the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (gives the **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (gives the **q**uartet, n=3).\n*   **A different signal that is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This proton must also be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (gives the **d**oublet, n=1).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (gives the first **t**riplet, n=2).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (gives the second **t**riplet, n=2).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of Each Candidate Molecule\n\nThe key is to find the single molecule that contains protons which would produce *both* a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n`...-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   The proton H(c) is coupled to H(b) (1H), the CH₂ group of the ethyl chain (2H), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton and two different sets of two protons. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n`...-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   The proton H(c) is coupled to H(b) (1H), the CH₂ of the main-chain ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂ of the substituent ethyl group (2H). This would produce a **dtt**.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to a 1H, a 2H, and a 3H environment. Therefore, a `dtq` signal is not expected.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's label the key protons in the structure: `CH₃(a)-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-CH(e)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(f)-COOH`\n*   **Analysis of proton H(d):** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The `CH₃(a)` group (3H) -> **quartet**\n    2.  The `H(e)` proton (1H) -> **doublet**\n    3.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**\n    This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Analysis of proton H(e):** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The `H(d)` proton (1H) -> **doublet**\n    2.  The `CH₂(f)` group (2H) -> **triplet**\n    3.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**\n    This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is the only candidate that contains protons that would give rise to both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n`...-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton H(d) is coupled to H(c) (1H), the adjacent CH₂ group (2H), and its attached CH₃ group (3H). This would produce a **dtq**.\n*   The proton H(c) is coupled to H(d) (1H) and two CH₃ groups (6H). This would be a doublet of septets. No other proton would produce a `dtt`. Therefore, this molecule does not fit the data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the systematic analysis of the splitting patterns for each candidate molecule, only structure C, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, is consistent with the 1H NMR data, which shows the presence of both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
