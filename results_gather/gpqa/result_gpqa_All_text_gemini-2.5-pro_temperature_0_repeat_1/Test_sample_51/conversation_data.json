    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question**\nThe main goal is to find the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations in two energy levels (N2/N1) of neutral Titanium changes. We need to calculate the value of [(N2/N1) for the star without spots] / [(N2/N1) for the star with spots].\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principle**\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the relative population of atoms in different energy states is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N_j, N_i are the number of atoms in the higher energy state (j) and lower energy state (i).\n*   g_j, g_i are the statistical weights of the states.\n*   E_j - E_i = ΔE is the energy difference between the states.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\n**3. Set Up the Ratio of Ratios**\nLet's define the population ratio as R = N2 / N1. We need to find the factor F = R_nospots / R_spots.\n\n*   For the star without spots (T = T_nospots):\n    R_nospots = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n\n*   For the star with spots (T = T_spots):\n    R_spots = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\nNow, we compute the factor F:\nF = R_nospots / R_spots = [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g2/g1) cancels out. Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)), we get:\nF = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\nF = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n**4. Identify and List the Necessary Values**\n*   **T_nospots:** The effective temperature when the surface is not covered by spots is given as 6000 K.\n*   **T_spots:** When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the *overall* photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. This is the temperature we should use for the \"with spots\" case, as it represents the average characteristic temperature of the photosphere from which the light is observed. The other information (star radius, mass, 40% coverage) is contextual and not needed for this calculation.\n*   **ΔE (Energy Difference):** The transition wavelength is given as λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m. The energy difference is the energy of a photon with this wavelength, calculated as ΔE = hc/λ.\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Planck's constant (h) ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Boltzmann constant (k) ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 5a: Calculate the energy difference ΔE.**\n    ΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    ΔE ≈ 1.3728 x 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n*   **Step 5b: Calculate the term ΔE / k.**\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.3728 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K)\n    ΔE / k ≈ 99406 K\n\n*   **Step 5c: Calculate the temperature-dependent part.**\n    (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K)\n    (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) K⁻¹\n    (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ≈ 0.00001515 K⁻¹\n\n*   **Step 5d: Calculate the final factor F.**\n    F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n    F = exp[ 99406 * 0.00001515 ]\n    F = exp(1.506)\n    F ≈ 4.508\n\n**6. Final Answer**\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option C. The ratio of populations in the higher energy state to the lower energy state is about 4.5 times greater in the hotter, unspotted star than in the cooler, spotted star.\n\n<<<C>>>"
