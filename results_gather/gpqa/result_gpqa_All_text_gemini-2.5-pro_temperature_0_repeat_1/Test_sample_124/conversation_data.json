    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. This potential is \"isotropic\" because it only depends on the radial distance $r$ and not on the angles.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Hamiltonian:**\n    The Hamiltonian operator for this system is the sum of the kinetic energy operator and the potential energy operator:\n    $H = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(r) = \\frac{\\hat{p}_x^2 + \\hat{p}_y^2 + \\hat{p}_z^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$\n\n3.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation (Method 1: Cartesian Coordinates):**\n    The Hamiltonian can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one for each Cartesian coordinate:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = \\frac{\\hat{p}_i^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $i = x, y, z$.\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    The total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\n4.  **Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of $N$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $N=0$. This is the lowest energy state.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$.\n\n    To find the energy of the third excited state, we set $N=3$ in the energy formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to write the integer $N$ as a sum of three non-negative integers. For $N=3$, we need to find all combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    Let's list the possible combinations:\n    *   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  ->  **3 states**\n    *   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n        *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  ->  **6 states**\n    *   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        *   (1, 1, 1)  ->  **1 state**\n\n    The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:\n    Degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**\n\n    *   **Careful Point (Degeneracy Formula):** A general formula for the degeneracy of the N-th level of a d-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is $g_N = \\binom{N+d-1}{d-1}$. For our case, $d=3$, so the degeneracy is $g_N = \\binom{N+2}{2} = \\frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$. For the third excited state ($N=3$), the degeneracy is $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$. This confirms our manual count.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy (degeneracy) is 10.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\nThe correct option is B. The energy expression in options C and D corresponds to a particle in a spherical infinite potential well, which is a different physical system.\n\n<<<B>>>"
