    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring a specific value (an eigenvalue) for a given observable. In quantum mechanics, this probability is found by projecting the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that specific value.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   **State vector of the system:** `|ψ⟩` = `[-1, 2, 1]^T` (a column matrix).\n*   **Observable operator:** `P` =\n    ```\n    | 0    1/√2   0   |\n    | 1/√2   0    1/√2 |\n    | 0    1/√2   0   |\n    ```\n*   **Value to be measured:** The eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n**3. The Underlying Principle**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `P` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\nwhere:\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product (or projection) of the state `|ψ⟩` onto the eigenvector `|v_λ⟩`.\n*   `|⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|^2` is the squared magnitude of this inner product.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector `|ψ⟩`. This term is necessary because the given state vector may not be normalized.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P.**\nFirst, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. We can verify that 0 is indeed an eigenvalue by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n`det(P - λI) = det | -λ   1/√2   0   | = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ`\nSetting this to zero: `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, which gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\nSince 0 is a valid eigenvalue, we can proceed.\n\n**Step 2: Find the eigenvector `|v_0⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.**\nWe need to solve the equation `P|v_0⟩ = 0|v_0⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v_0⟩ = 0`.\nLet `|v_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n```\n| 0    1/√2   0   | | x |   | 0 |\n| 1/√2   0    1/√2 | | y | = | 0 |\n| 0    1/√2   0   | | z |   | 0 |\n```\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2)y = 0` (This is redundant)\n\nThe eigenvector has the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose `x=1` for simplicity, giving an unnormalized eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must use a normalized eigenvector for the projection formula.\n*   Norm-squared of `[1, 0, -1]^T` is `(1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 2`.\n*   The norm is `√2`.\n*   The normalized eigenvector `|v_0⟩` is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the squared norm of the state vector `|ψ⟩`.**\nThe given state vector is `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n**Careful Point:** The state vector provided is not normalized, so we must calculate its norm and include it in the probability formula's denominator.\n*   The bra vector is `⟨ψ| = [-1, 2, 1]`.\n*   The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (-1)(-1) + (2)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the inner product `⟨v_0|ψ⟩`.**\n*   `⟨v_0|` is the conjugate transpose of `|v_0⟩`. Since the elements are real, it's just the transpose: `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n*   `⟨v_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   `⟨v_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * [(1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1)]`\n*   `⟨v_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1 + 0 - 1] = -2/√2 = -√2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final probability.**\nNow we plug all the pieces into the probability formula:\n`Prob(λ=0) = |⟨v_0|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\n*   `|⟨v_0|ψ⟩|^2 = |-√2|^2 = 2`.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 6`.\n*   `Prob(λ=0) = 2 / 6 = 1/3`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability that a measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0 is 1/3. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
