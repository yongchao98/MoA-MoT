    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   A triplet for 6H indicates two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2).\n*   A quartet for 4H indicates two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   This 6H:4H ratio and triplet/quartet splitting pattern is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).\n*   The problem describes a series of reactions typical for alkanes (monobromination, elimination). We need to find an alkane that fits this description.\n*   Let's consider n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). Due to symmetry, it has two types of protons.\n    *   The 6 protons of the two terminal -CH3 groups are equivalent. They are adjacent to a -CH2 group (2 protons), so they appear as a triplet (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    *   The 4 protons of the two internal -CH2 groups are equivalent. They are adjacent to a -CH3 group (3 protons), so they appear as a multiplet, specifically a sextet (n+1 = 3+2 = 5, but coupling to two different protons makes it a sextet).\n*   The question states the 4H signal is a \"quartet\". This is a slight inaccuracy in the problem description; it should be a sextet. However, n-butane is the only simple alkane that fits the integration (6H:4H) and the subsequent reaction chemistry. The rest of the reaction sequence confirms this choice.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** Compound A is n-butane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form compound B.\n*   Free-radical bromination of an alkane is selective for the most substituted carbon. In n-butane, the secondary carbons (C2, C4) are more reactive than the primary carbons (C1, C5).\n*   Therefore, the major product of monobromination is 2-bromobutane.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:** Compound B is 2-bromobutane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base in a non-polar solvent, favoring an E2 elimination reaction.\n*   Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form two possible alkenes: but-1-ene (by removing a proton from C1) and but-2-ene (by removing a proton from C3).\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. Therefore, but-2-ene is the major product.\n*   The problem states that \"C has two geometrical isomers\". But-2-ene exists as cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene. This confirms that C is but-2-ene.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 3:** Compound C is but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Diels-Alder Reaction to Identify Compound D**\n\n*   The reaction is between the \"cis-isomer of C\" and \"(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\".\n*   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene.\n*   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction (Diels-Alder).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Regiochemistry and Stereochemistry of the Product D**\n\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative). Let's number the diene atoms C1-C4 and the dienophile atoms C5-C6. The new bonds form between C1-C6 and C4-C5.\n    *   The -OH group from the diene is at C1.\n    *   The -CH3 group from the diene is at C4.\n    *   The two -CH3 groups from the dienophile are at C5 and C6.\n    *   The resulting product is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This structure eliminates options B and C, which have a 4,6,6-trimethyl substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    1.  **Diene Conformation:** For the reaction, the diene must be in the s-cis conformation. In (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the C1-OH group is \"exo\" (pointing away) and the C4-CH3 group is \"endo\" (pointing inwards).\n    2.  **Syn-addition:** The stereochemistry of the dienophile is preserved. Since we start with cis-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups at C5 and C6 must be cis to each other in the product.\n    3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction can proceed through two transition states, leading to an endo or an exo product.\n        *   The **endo product** is usually kinetically favored. In this case, the dienophile's substituents (the two -CH3 groups) would be on the same side of the new ring as the diene's \"endo\" substituent (the C4-CH3). This would result in a product where the C1-OH is trans to all three methyl groups. The calculated absolute stereochemistry for this product is (1S, 4R, 5R, 6S), which is not among the options.\n        *   The **exo product** is sometimes formed, especially if there is significant steric hindrance in the endo transition state. In the exo product, the dienophile's substituents (the two -CH3 groups) are on the opposite side of the ring from the diene's \"endo\" substituent (the C4-CH3).\n    4.  **Stereochemistry of the Exo Product:**\n        *   The C1-OH is trans to the C4-CH3 (from the diene's geometry).\n        *   The C5-CH3 and C6-CH3 are cis to each other (from the dienophile's geometry).\n        *   The C5-CH3 and C6-CH3 are trans to the C4-CH3 (from exo addition).\n        *   This relative arrangement corresponds to the absolute stereochemistry **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated stereochemistry for the exo product, (1S, 4R, 5S, 6R), matches option D. Therefore, compound D is the exo product of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nFinal Answer is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
