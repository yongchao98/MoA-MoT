    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This is the ratio P3 / P1.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T2 / T3 ≈ 2.3\n    *   Ratio of masses: M1 / M2 ≈ 1.15 (This is extra information and not needed for the calculation).\n    *   Ratio of masses: M2 / M3 ≈ 1.35 (This is also extra information).\n    *   Albedo (A) is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3). The specific value is not important, only that it is constant.\n    *   The planets have circular orbits around the same star.\n\n3.  **List the Necessary Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity (L), the planet's albedo (A), and its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, 'a'). The formula is derived from the balance between absorbed and radiated energy:\n        T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\n        Since the albedo (A) is the same for all planets, this simplifies the relationship between temperature and orbital radius to:\n        T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a²\n        Taking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n        T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n        P² ∝ a³\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   **Part 1:** Use the temperature ratios to find the ratio of the orbital radii (a3 / a1).\n    *   **Part 2:** Use the ratio of the orbital radii and Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods (P3 / P1).\n\n### Executing the Plan\n\n**Part 1: Find the ratio of orbital radii (a3 / a1)**\n\n*   From the equilibrium temperature relationship (T_eq ∝ 1 / √a), we can write the ratio of radii in terms of the ratio of temperatures:\n    a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n    So, a_x / a_y = (T_y / T_x)²\n\n*   First, find the ratio a2 / a1 using the given T1 / T2 ratio:\n    a2 / a1 = (T1 / T2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n*   Next, find the ratio a3 / a2 using the given T2 / T3 ratio:\n    a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\n*   Now, we can find the total ratio a3 / a1 by multiplying the intermediate ratios:\n    a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.3684\n\n**Part 2: Find the ratio of orbital periods (P3 / P1)**\n\n*   From Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³), we can write the relationship for the periods as:\n    P ∝ a^(3/2)\n    So, the ratio of the periods is:\n    P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n*   Substitute the value of a3 / a1 we calculated in Part 1:\n    P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n\n*   Let's calculate the final value:\n    P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^1.5 ≈ 33.38\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 3.2\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The masses of the planets and the mention of the TTV method are distractors. For orbital periods around a much more massive star, the planets' own masses are negligible.\n*   The specific value of the albedo (0.3) is also a distractor. The crucial piece of information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, which allows it to be canceled out in the ratios.\n*   The relationship between temperature and orbital radius (T ∝ 1/√a) and Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³) are the only two concepts needed to solve the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
