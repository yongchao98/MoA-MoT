    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem deals with the population of atoms in different energy levels (\"excited\" atoms) within a stellar photosphere assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The physical law that describes this situation is the **Boltzmann Equation**.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states, say an excited state 'b' and a lower energy state 'a'.\n    \n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n    \n    Where:\n    *   N_b, N_a are the number of atoms in states b and a.\n    *   g_b, g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   E_b - E_a = ΔE is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Problem Mathematically:**\n    *   We have two stars, star_1 with temperature T_1 and star_2 with temperature T_2.\n    *   We are considering the same energy levels of iron in both stars, so the values for ΔE, g_b, and g_a are identical for both cases.\n    *   The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the lower state in star_1 is double the ratio in star_2.\n    *   Mathematically: (N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\n4.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star:**\n    *   For star_1: (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2: (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions from Step 4 into the relationship from Step 3.\n    \n    (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * { (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] }\n\n6.  **Simplify the Combined Equation:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since we are observing the same transition in both stars, the term for the statistical weights, (g_b / g_a), is the same on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    \n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Incorporate the Given Numerical Values:**\n    *   The problem gives the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial detail. The problem is designed so that the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1 (with units of Kelvin). This simplifies the exponents significantly.\n    \n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n    \n    Substituting this into our simplified equation:\n    \n    exp[-1 / T_1] = 2 * exp[-1 / T_2]\n\n8.  **Solve for the Relationship Between T_1 and T_2:** To solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n    \n    ln(exp[-1 / T_1]) = ln(2 * exp[-1 / T_2])\n    \n    Using the logarithm properties ln(exp(x)) = x and ln(a * b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n    \n    -1 / T_1 = ln(2) + ln(exp[-1 / T_2])\n    -1 / T_1 = ln(2) - 1 / T_2\n\n9.  **Isolate ln(2) and Finalize the Expression:** Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2).\n    \n    ln(2) = 1 / T_2 - 1 / T_1\n    \n    To get the expression into the format of the options, find a common denominator for the right side, which is (T_1 * T_2).\n    \n    ln(2) = (1 * T_1) / (T_2 * T_1) - (1 * T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n    \n    Combine the fractions:\n    \n    **ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)**\n\n10. **Compare with the Options:** The derived equation matches option D exactly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final derived equation is ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)].\n\n<<<D>>>"
