    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n**Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (very broad):** A very broad absorption in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ range is the most characteristic feature of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between acid molecules. An alcohol O-H is also broad but typically centered higher (3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid typically appears between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This peak is consistent with the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   **Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The data strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. We need to determine what common chemical fragment has a mass-to-charge ratio of 45.\n    *   The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: (1 x Carbon) + (2 x Oxygen) + (1 x Hydrogen) = (1 x 12) + (2 x 16) + (1 x 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45.\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** This provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we have confidently identified two key features of the molecule:\n        1.  A **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n        2.  An **alkene** group (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates the options with only one oxygen atom: C6H12O and C6H10O.\n    *   We are left with two possible formulas: **C6H12O2** and **C6H10O2**.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each. The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require a certain DoU:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) = 1 degree of unsaturation.\n        *   **Total required DoU = 1 + 1 = 2.**\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   For **C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula can only account for one double bond (e.g., the C=O in a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid), but not the additional C=C bond.\n        *   For **C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has exactly the two degrees of unsaturation required to accommodate both the C=O of the carboxylic acid and the C=C of the alkene.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicates the presence of both a carboxylic acid and an alkene, which requires a total of two degrees of unsaturation. Only the molecular formula C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
