    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The equilibrium reaction for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n*   The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Set up the Equilibrium Calculation**\n\n*   We are starting with a solution that contains 0.02 M of the complex [CaY]²⁻. This complex will slightly dissociate to reach equilibrium. Therefore, it is more convenient to consider the *dissociation* reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction, K_d, is the inverse of the formation constant, K_f:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Use an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species       | [CaY]²⁻      | Ca²⁺         | Y⁴⁻          |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M       | 0 M          | 0 M          |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x           | +x           | +x           |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x     | x            | x            |\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem states \"ideal pH\". This is a crucial simplification. The binding of EDTA is pH-dependent. \"Ideal pH\" implies that the pH is high enough so that all free EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion. This allows us to use the given K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of EDTA.\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\n\n*   The equilibrium expression for the dissociation reaction is:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n*   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Assumption**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the dissociation constant K_d (2 x 10⁻¹¹) is extremely small, the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n*   The simplified equation is:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Now, solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (2 x 10⁻²)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n*   Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    To make the exponent even, we can write this as:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n*   From our ICE table, the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Verify the Assumption**\nIs x << 0.02?\n6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is much, much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2 x 10⁻²). The assumption was valid.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
