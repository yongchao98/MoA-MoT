    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), is strong enough to deprotonate the highly acidic α-carbon (the one between the two ester groups), forming a resonance-stabilized enolate ion: ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to conjugation with the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   The π-electrons from the C=C double bond shift to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -⁻CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   This enolate intermediate is then protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), at the α-carbon.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product (A):**\n    *   The final product is formed by creating a new C-C bond between the central carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate, and adding a hydrogen to the α-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The structure of the product (A) is: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂(COOCH₃).\n    *   To name this compound, we can use the IUPAC nomenclature system suggested by the options. Let's consider a propane backbone. The structure can be written as (CH₃OOC)CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH₃)₂. This corresponds to a propane chain where C1 has two methyl carboxylate groups, C2 has a p-tolyl group, and C3 is part of a methyl carboxylate group. The name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Reaction):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of Michael Addition and Hydrolysis:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a ketone. The piperidine is removed as a water-soluble salt.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product (B):**\n    *   The starting ketone was cyclohexanone. The Michael addition adds a substituent to the α-carbon (C2).\n    *   The substituent comes from but-2-enenitrile. The new bond is at the β-carbon, and the α-carbon is protonated. The added group is -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group at the C2 position.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The butanenitrile is the principal chain, and the substituted cyclohexanone is a substituent at position 3. The keto form is the major product over the enol form.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Known Reactant to find C:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the Michael donor (C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This consists of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and a 3-oxobutyl group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃) attached at the C2 position.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n    *   In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. After protonation of the α-carbon, the MVK molecule becomes the -CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃ group, which is the 3-oxobutyl group seen in the product.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Donor (C):**\n    *   Since the 3-oxobutyl group comes from MVK, the rest of the molecule must come from the Michael donor, C.\n    *   The remaining part is the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   The reaction is run in base (KOH), which deprotonates the Michael donor to make it nucleophilic. The C2 position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is an active methylene position (protons are acidic because they are between two carbonyl groups).\n    *   Therefore, the reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base forms the enolate at C2, which then attacks MVK to form the final product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   B) Incorrect A, Incorrect B, Incorrect C\n*   C) Correct A, Correct B, Correct C\n*   D) Incorrect C\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
