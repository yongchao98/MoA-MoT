    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The core principle to solve this problem is the **conservation of total relativistic energy**. In an isolated system like this oscillator, the total energy remains constant throughout its motion.\n\n2.  **Define Total Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy `K` and its rest energy `mc^2`. In the presence of a potential field, the total conserved energy of the system `E_total` is the sum of the particle's total energy and the potential energy `U`.\n    *   Total Relativistic Energy of the particle: `E = γmc^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Potential Energy of the oscillator: `U(x) = (1/2)kx^2`, derived from the force `F = -kx`.\n    *   Total Conserved Energy of the system: `E_total = E + U = γmc^2 + (1/2)kx^2`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Energy at the Point of Maximum Amplitude (x = A):**\n    *   At the maximum amplitude `x = A`, the oscillator momentarily stops. Therefore, its velocity `v = 0`.\n    *   When `v = 0`, the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0^2/c^2) = 1`.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: `U_max = (1/2)kA^2`.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        `E_total = (1)mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x = 0):**\n    *   At the equilibrium position `x = 0`, the potential energy is zero: `U = 0`.\n    *   The speed of the oscillator is at its maximum, `v = v_max`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        `E_total = γ_max * mc^2 + 0 = γ_max * mc^2`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Conservation of Energy:** Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    `E_total (at x=A) = E_total (at x=0)`\n    `mc^2 + (1/2)kA^2 = γ_max * mc^2`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Maximum Lorentz Factor (γ_max):**\n    *   Divide the entire equation by `mc^2`:\n        `1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2) = γ_max`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Maximum Speed (v_max):** Now we use the definition of `γ_max` to find `v_max`.\n    *   Start with the definition: `γ_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `γ_max` we found in the previous step:\n        `1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`\n    *   To solve for `v_max`, we rearrange the equation. First, invert both sides:\n        `1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2)) = sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)`\n    *   Square both sides:\n        `1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))^2 = 1 - v_max^2/c^2`\n    *   Isolate the `v_max^2/c^2` term:\n        `v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))^2`\n    *   Finally, multiply by `c^2` and take the square root to find `v_max`:\n        `v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + kA^2 / (2mc^2))^2)`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The derived expression for the maximum speed `v_max` matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** It is crucial to use the relativistic form of energy (`E = γmc^2`), not the classical kinetic energy (`K = 1/2 mv^2`). Using the classical form would lead to answer A, which is incorrect for a relativistic system.\n*   **Total Energy Conservation:** The conserved quantity is the sum of the particle's total relativistic energy (`γmc^2`) and the potential energy (`U`). One must not forget to include the rest energy `mc^2` in the calculation.\n*   **Dimensionality:** The term `kA^2 / (2mc^2)` must be dimensionless. `kA^2` has units of energy, and so does `mc^2`, so the ratio is indeed dimensionless. This is a good sanity check.\n*   **Algebra:** The algebraic manipulation to isolate `v_max` from the `γ_max` expression involves several steps (inverting, squaring, rearranging). Care must be taken at each step to avoid errors.\n\nThe final derived formula is:\n$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
