    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information from the problem statement.**\n\n1.  **Molecular Framework:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The degree of unsaturation for the ring itself is 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n2.  **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms (C, O2) and adds one degree of unsaturation due to the C=O double bond.\n3.  **Proton NMR (1H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons (C6H4). Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution). In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons form two chemically distinct sets (an AA'BB' system), which often appears as two signals (two doublets).\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** This indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with a proton on each carbon. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Hb) is coupled to two different groups of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, which must be Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, which must be a -CH3 group).\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group would be the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton would be the doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n        *   One -CH3 group is already identified as part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be located elsewhere. Given the presence of an ester group, a methyl ester (-COOCH3) is a very common and plausible structure. A methyl group in this position would be a singlet, as it's not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or other alkyl chains with methylene groups.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the structural fragments.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: -C6H4-\n*   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n*   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n\nLet's combine these to form the complete molecule. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the propenyl group and the methyl ester group.\n\nThe proposed structure is: **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n      CH3\n       |\n      (O=)C-O\n       |\n      / \\\n     |   |\n    // \\\\ //\n   |     |\n    \\\\ // \\\\\n     |   |\n      \\ /\n       |\n      CH=CH-CH3\n```\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Di-substituted aromatic ring:** Yes.\n*   **Ester group:** Yes (-COOCH3).\n*   **Aromatic-H:** Yes, 4 protons in a para arrangement, giving 2 signals.\n*   **Vinyl-H:** Yes, the -CH=CH- part gives 2 signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets).\n*   **-CH3 groups:** Yes, two of them. One in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and one in the methyl ester (-COOCH3). They are in different chemical environments, so they will give two separate signals.\n*   **No -CH2 groups:** Yes, the structure contains no -CH2- groups.\n\nThe proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the chemical formula from the proposed structure.**\n\nNow, we count the atoms in the structure CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 1 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from ester CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 3 (from propenyl CH3) + 2 (from -CH=CH-) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from ester CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester -COO-) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\n*   A) C11H14O2\n*   B) C12H12O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe correct formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
