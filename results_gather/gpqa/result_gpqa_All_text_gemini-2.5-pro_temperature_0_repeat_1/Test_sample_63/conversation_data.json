    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B was heated, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases. This gaseous mixture was then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing anions like carbonate (CO₃²⁻).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Red-hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. In this context, it reacts with oxygen (O₂). The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that the products include H₂O and O₂, the original salts likely contained H, O, and N. Therefore, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\nWe know the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. The combined empirical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is H₈N₄O₅. Since the salts are composed of H, N, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\nLet's test common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's sum the formulas of these two salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio we derived. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification with stoichiometry and mass.**\nThe mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  (or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n\nLet's calculate the expected moles of products from 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   Total H₂O = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 2 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 2 = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 1 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 1 = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n(from NH₄NO₃) × 0.5 = 0.5n\n\nUsing our experimental values:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our hypothesis.\n\nFinally, let's check the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>"
