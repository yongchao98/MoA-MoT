    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We need to find a valid decay path and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an atomic transition to be allowed under the E1 approximation, the quantum numbers of the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must satisfy the following rules:\n    *   **Parity change:** The parity of the state must change. This is equivalent to the rule for the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $m$, must be:\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number, $n$, can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n$ is unrestricted), but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:** The atom starts in the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and decays to an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l=0$. So, $l_k - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ cannot be negative, the intermediate state must have $l_k = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $m=0$. So, $m_k - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m_k = -1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n    *   **Applying $n_k < n_i$:** The initial state has $n_i=3$. So, the intermediate state must have $n_k < 3$. The options provided suggest the intermediate state has $n_k=2$.\n    *   **Possible Intermediate States:** Based on the selection rules and the options, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:** The atom decays from the intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if this is an allowed transition.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The initial state has $l_k=1$ and the final state has $l_f=0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the rule.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** The final state has $m_f=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m_k$.\n        *   If $m_k = -1$, $\\Delta m = 1$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   If $m_k = 1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. (Allowed)\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three possible intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$) can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Therefore, all the routes listed in the options are physically possible.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities:** The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n    *   **Probability of the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. The three possible final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy. Due to the symmetry of the initial state and the interaction, the probability of decaying into any of these three substates is equal.\n        Since there are 3 equally likely outcomes, the probability for any specific one is:\n        $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m_k\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_k = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step ($|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        We need to find the branching ratio for this decay. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the total decay rate of the state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$. Let's find all possible decay channels for $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ means the final state must have $l_f = 0$ or $l_f = 2$.\n        *   The rule $n_f < n_k=2$ means $n_f$ must be 1.\n        *   A state with $n=1$ must have $l=0$ (the 1s state). A state with $l=2$ requires $n \\ge 3$.\n        *   Therefore, the only possible final state for a decay from the $n=2, l=1$ level is the $n=1, l=0$ level.\n        *   This means that once the atom reaches any of the $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ states, it is guaranteed to decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. The branching ratio is 1.\n        $P(|2,1,m_k\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Probability of the Cascade:**\n    The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps.\n    *   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be 1/3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe only option that provides a valid route with the correct probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
