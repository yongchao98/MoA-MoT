    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the genetic experiment to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the phenotypes of the single mutants.\nThis step helps us understand the individual contribution of each gene to anthracnose resistance. The wild-type (control) has 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knocked out):** 75% resistance. This means the loss of G1 function causes a 25% reduction in resistance. Therefore, G1 positively contributes to resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knocked out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is essential for the resistance phenotype.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knocked out):** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% reduction in resistance. Therefore, G3 also positively contributes to resistance, and its contribution is larger than G1's.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the phenotypes of the double mutants to determine epistasis.\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. In a double mutant, if the phenotype resembles one of the single mutants, the gene from that single mutant is considered \"epistatic\" to the other gene. In a regulatory pathway, an upstream gene is typically epistatic to a downstream gene.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:**\n    *   Phenotype of g1: 75% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g1g2: 0% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant. This means the g2 mutation masks the effect of the g1 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:**\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g3: 50% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g2g3: 0% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant. This means the g2 mutation masks the effect of the g3 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:**\n    *   Phenotype of g1: 75% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g3: 50% resistance\n    *   Phenotype of g1g3: 10% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (10%) is not the same as either single mutant. In fact, it is more severe than both. This indicates a synergistic or additive interaction between G1 and G3. It means they likely act in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance. There is no epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the findings to build a pathway model.\n*   From Step 2, we concluded that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n*   We are told that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others.\n*   The epistasis results strongly suggest that **G2 is the transcription factor** that activates the expression of both G1 and G3. The pathway would look like this:\n    *   G2 (TF) → activates G1\n    *   G2 (TF) → activates G3\n    *   G1 and G3 then act in parallel to create the resistance phenotype.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the given options based on the conclusions.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct**. This is our main conclusion.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Plausible**. G1 and G3 act in parallel to contribute to the same trait (resistance). The loss of one is partially compensated by the other. This is a form of partial redundancy or synergistic interaction. This is the most reasonable description of their relationship among the options.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect**. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: **Incorrect**. Our analysis shows G2 is the upstream TF.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is correct, but the main premise of the option is wrong.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct**.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: **Unsupported**. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data for one trait (resistance). We cannot conclude this.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct**.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: **Unsupported**. While possible, we cannot conclude this from phenotype data. They could have separate promoters that are both activated by G2.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: **Incorrect**. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOption A contains the most accurate and plausible conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment, despite having one incorrect clause. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and provides the most reasonable description of the relationship between G1 and G3 (\"gene redundancy\") compared to the unsupported speculation in options C and D. The final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is factually incorrect based on the data, but option A remains the best fit among the flawed choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
