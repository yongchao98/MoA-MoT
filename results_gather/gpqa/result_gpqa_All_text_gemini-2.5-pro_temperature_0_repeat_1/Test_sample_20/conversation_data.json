    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part 1: Identifying Compound (A) - Tautomerism**\n\n**Concept:** Tautomerism is a type of constitutional isomerism where two isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must satisfy two key conditions:\n1.  It must have a carbonyl group (keto form).\n2.  It must have at least one hydrogen atom on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon). This α-hydrogen must be on an sp³ hybridized carbon for typical tautomerism to occur.\n3.  The keto and enol forms must have the same molecular formula.\n\n**Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n*   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **α-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n*   **α-Hydrogens:** Each of these α-carbons is part of a C=C double bond (sp² hybridized) and is bonded to one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Tautomerization Check:** If benzoquinone were to tautomerize, it would form hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol). The molecular formula of hydroquinone is C₆H₆O₂. Since the molecular formulas of benzoquinone (C₆H₄O₂) and hydroquinone (C₆H₆O₂) are different, they are not isomers. The conversion between them is a reduction/oxidation reaction, not tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n**Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n*   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. Its molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃.\n*   **α-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all α-carbons to two different carbonyl groups.\n*   **α-Hydrogens:** These α-carbons are sp³ hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Tautomerization Check:** Since there are α-hydrogens on sp³ carbons, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. It can tautomerize to form its enol form, phloroglucinol (benzene-1,3,5-triol). The molecular formula of phloroglucinol is C₆H₆O₃, which is the same as the keto form. This enol form is highly stable because it is an aromatic compound. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Identifying Compound (B) - Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Concept:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reason for chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center Check:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.**\n\n**Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chiral Center Check:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The two central carbons are sp² hybridized.\n*   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) as well as a center of inversion. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it **will not show optical isomerism.** (Note: It does show geometric isomerism).\n\n**Conclusion for (B):** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Determination**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the given options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
