    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. I will calculate each of these separately.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic velocities, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula, not a simple subtraction. Let the lab frame be S. Let the frame of reference of astronaut 2 (moving at v2 = 0.5c) be S'.\n\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1 in frame S: `u = v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Velocity of frame S' relative to S: `v = v2 = 0.5c`\n\nThe velocity of astronaut 1 as observed from frame S' (which is the relative velocity, v_rel) is given by:\n`v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2/c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The formula for the relativistic energy of a particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n    *   Mass: `m1 = 2m`\n    *   Velocity: `v1 = 0.6c`\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (γ1):\n        `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Calculate the energy of astronaut 1:\n        `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n    *   Mass: `m2 = 3m`\n    *   Velocity: `v2 = 0.5c`\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (γ2):\n        `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n        `γ2 = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547`\n    *   Calculate the energy of astronaut 2:\n        `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 = (2/sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c^2 = (6/sqrt(3))mc^2 = 2*sqrt(3)mc^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    *   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 2*sqrt(3) mc^2`\n    *   `E_total = (2.5 + 2*sqrt(3)) mc^2`\n    *   `E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 ≈ 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is `E_total = 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and the calculated total energy is `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`. Comparing these results with the given options:\n\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nOption B matches both of our calculated values.\n\n**2. Python Code for Verification**\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# m is the base mass unit\n# c is the speed of light\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1_factor = 2.0\nv1_factor = 0.6  # v1 = 0.6c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2_factor = 3.0\nv2_factor = 0.5  # v2 = 0.5c\n\n# 1. Calculate Relative Speed\n# Using the relativistic velocity transformation formula: v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c^2)\n# In units of c, the formula simplifies to: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2)\nv_rel = (v1_factor - v2_factor) / (1 - v1_factor * v2_factor)\n# Speed is the magnitude\nv_rel_speed = abs(v_rel)\n\n# 2.
