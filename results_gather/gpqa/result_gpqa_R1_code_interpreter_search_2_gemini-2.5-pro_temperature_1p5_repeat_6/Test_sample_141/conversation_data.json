    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the geometrical position, represented by a vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, of a given density matrix $\\rho$ in the qubit's state space, also known as the Bloch sphere.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formula:** Any density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix $I$ and the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ using the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n    The vector $\\vec{r}$ defines the position of the state within the Bloch sphere. For pure states, $|\\vec{r}|=1$, and for mixed states, $|\\vec{r}|<1$. The center of the sphere corresponds to $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n\n3.  **Express the Given Density Matrix in Matrix Form:**\n    The given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n    We know the standard basis states in matrix form:\n    $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    From these, we can compute the outer products:\n    $|0\\rangle \\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|1\\rangle \\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Now, substitute these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This is simply half the identity matrix: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Bloch Vector $\\vec{r}$:**\n    We now have two expressions for our density matrix:\n    1.  From the problem statement: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    2.  From the general formula: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\n    Equating these two gives:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    Multiplying both sides by 2:\n    $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$\n    Subtracting $I$ from both sides:\n    $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z$\n\n    The Pauli matrices are linearly independent. This means that the only way their linear combination can equal the zero matrix is if all the scalar coefficients ($r_x, r_y, r_z$) are zero.\n    Therefore, we must have:\n    $r_x = 0$\n    $r_y = 0$\n    $r_z = 0$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The Bloch vector for the given density matrix is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the center (origin) of the Bloch sphere. This state is known as the maximally mixed state, representing a 50/50 mixture of the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states, with no phase coherence between them.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) r=(0,0,0)\n    B) r=(0,0,1)\n    C) r=(1,1,1)\n    D) r=(1,1,0)\n\n    Our calculated result $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
