    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction C: 2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The starting material is 2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene. Its structure is `CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2-O-CH=CH2`. This compound contains both an allyl group (`CH2=C(R)-CH2-`) and a vinyl ether group (`-O-CH=CH2`). A molecule with this structure, when heated, undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the **Claisen rearrangement**.\n\n2.  **Trace the atoms for the rearrangement:** The general scheme for a Claisen rearrangement is a concerted, pericyclic reaction involving a 6-atom chain that rearranges through a cyclic transition state. We can number the atoms involved in the rearrangement as follows:\n    `C(3)=C(2)-C(1)-O(3')-C(2')=C(1')`\n    In our specific molecule:\n    *   The allyl part is `CH2(3)=C(2)(CH2CH3)-CH2(1)-`\n    *   The vinyl part is `-O(3')-CH(2')=CH2(1')`\n\n    The [3,3]-sigmatropic shift involves forming a new sigma bond between atom C(1') and atom C(3), and breaking the existing sigma bond between C(1) and O(3'). The pi bonds shift accordingly.\n\n3.  **Determine the product structure:**\n    *   Initial connectivity: `C(1')H2=C(2')H - O - C(1)H2 - C(2)(Et)=C(3)H2`\n    *   The new bond is between C(1') and C(3). The O-C(1) bond breaks.\n    *   The C(2')=C(1') double bond shifts to C(2')-C(1').\n    *   The O-C(2') bond becomes a C=O double bond (part of an aldehyde/ketone).\n    *   The C(2)=C(3) double bond shifts to C(1)-C(2).\n    *   Product skeleton: `O=C(2')H - C(1')H2 - C(3)H2 - C(2)(Et)=C(1)H2`\n\n    Let's redraw the product structure with all atoms:\n    `O=CH - CH2 - CH2 - C(CH2CH3)=CH2`\n\n4.  **Name the product:** The product is an aldehyde. We number the carbon chain starting from the aldehyde group (C=O) as carbon 1.\n    `CHO(1)-CH2(2)-CH2(3)-C(4)(=CH2)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`\n    The longest carbon chain is 6 carbons long, so it is a hexanal derivative. There is a methylene group (=CH2) at position 4.\n    Therefore, the name of product C is **4-methylenehexanal**.\n\n5.  **Compare with options:**\n    *   Options A and B list C as `4-methylenehexanal`.\n    *   Options C and D list C as `4-methylenehexan-1-ol`.\n    This analysis eliminates options C and D. We are left with A and B.\n\n### Reaction B: (3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B\n\n1.  **Analyze the starting material and reaction conditions:** The starting material is `(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne`, which is a meso-compound. Its molecular formula is C8H10. The only condition is heat, which suggests a thermal pericyclic reaction or rearrangement where the molecular formula is conserved. Product B must also have the formula C8H10.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options for product B based on molecular formula:**\n    *   Option A's product B: `(1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane`.\n        *   Structure: A cyclobutane ring with two ethylidene (=CH-CH3) groups on adjacent carbons (C1, C2).\n        *   Carbons: 4 (ring) + 2 * 2 (side chains) = 8 carbons (C8).\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (on C3 and C4, CH2-CH2) + 2 * (1+3) (side chains) = 4 + 8 = 12 hydrogens (H12).\n        *   Molecular formula: C8H12. This does not match the starting material's formula (C8H10). Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   Option B's product B: `(3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene`.\n        *   Structure: A cyclobutene ring with two ethylidene (=CH-CH3) groups on the sp3-hybridized carbons (C3, C4).\n        *   Carbons: 4 (ring) + 2 * 2 (side chains) = 8 carbons (C8).\n        *   Hydrogens: 2 (on the double bond, CH=CH) + 2 * (1+3) (side chains) = 2 + 8 = 10 hydrogens (H10).\n        *   Molecular formula: C8H10. This matches the starting material's formula.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:** Based on the conservation of the molecular formula, `(1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane` cannot be the product. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Our analysis of Reaction C showed that the product is **4-methylenehexanal**, which eliminated options C and D.\n*   Our analysis of Reaction B showed that the product must have the formula C8H10. The product proposed in option A (`(1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane`, C8H12) has an incorrect formula, thus **eliminating option A**.\n\nThis leaves **Option B** as the only possible correct answer.\n\n### Final Check of Option B\n\n*   **A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine:** While the mechanism for this transformation is complex and likely relies on a non-standard reaction or a typo in the reactant name, it is stoichiometrically plausible as a condensation product.\n*   **B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene:** This is a C8H10 isomer of the starting material. The thermal rearrangement of 1,5-diynes to dialkylidenecyclobutenes is a known (though complex) transformation.\n*   **C = 4-methylenehexanal:** Our derivation confirms this is the correct product of the Claisen rearrangement.\n\nThe process of elimination strongly points to B being the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
