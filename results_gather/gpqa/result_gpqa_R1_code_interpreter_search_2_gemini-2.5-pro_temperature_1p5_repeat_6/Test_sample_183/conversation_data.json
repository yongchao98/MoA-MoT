    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the positions and directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) at C1:** A strong activating group and an *ortho*, *para*-director.\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at C2:** A moderate activating group and an *ortho*,*para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its *ortho* positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group) at C3:** A strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are *ortho* to each other.\n*   tert-Butyl and nitro are *ortho* to each other.\n*   Ethoxy and nitro are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe goal is to find a high-yield synthesis, which means we must carefully plan the order of substitution to ensure the directing effects of the substituents lead to the desired product.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Final step is Nitration?**\n    The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The directing groups are -OEt (at C1, o,p-director) and -tBu (at C2, o,p-director).\n    -   -OEt directs to C4 (para) and C6 (ortho).\n    -   -tBu directs to C4 (meta), C5 (ortho), and C6 (para).\n    Both groups strongly activate positions C4 and C6. Position C3 is *ortho* to the very bulky t-butyl group and *meta* to the ethoxy group. Nitration would predominantly occur at C4 and C6, not at the desired C3 position. This would not be a high-yield reaction for the target molecule.\n\n*   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (adding t-butyl)?**\n    The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    -   -OEt (at C1) is an o,p-director, activating positions C2, C4, C6.\n    -   -NO2 (at C3) is a m-director, deactivating the ring but directing incoming electrophiles to C2, C4, C6 (relative to its own position). However, the -NO2 group is at C3, so it directs to C5 and C1 (blocked). This analysis is incorrect. -NO2 at C3 directs to position 5 and meta-position to itself C1 which is blocked. Let's re-evaluate. NO2 at C3 directs to C5 (meta). The other meta position is C1 (blocked). Let's re-evaluate from the perspective of the incoming group. For an electrophile approaching C2, it is ortho to OEt and ortho to NO2. Ortho to OEt is good. Ortho to NO2 is bad. For an electrophile approaching C4, it is para to OEt and ortho to NO2. Good. For an electrophile approaching C6, it is ortho to OEt and meta to NO2. Good. It seems C4 and C6 are favored. But Friedel-Crafts reactions generally fail on rings strongly deactivated by groups like -NO2. Even with the activating -OEt group, the reaction would likely be very low-yield or fail completely.\n\n*   **Final step is Williamson Ether Synthesis (adding ethoxy)?**\n    This is usually a reliable and high-yield reaction. The precursor would be the corresponding phenol: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This would be reacted with a base (like NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    This seems plausible. The problem now becomes synthesizing **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    A phenol is often synthesized from an aniline (-NH2) via a diazonium salt. The precursor to the phenol would therefore be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n**3. Synthesizing the Key Intermediate: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n\nThe core of the problem is to make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline efficiently. Let's trace a path to this intermediate. The relative positions are NH2 at C1, t-Bu at C2, NO2 at C3. Notice the t-butyl and nitro groups are ortho, and the amino and t-butyl groups are ortho. This is a very crowded arrangement.\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided, assuming they represent sequential reaction steps.\n\n*   **Option A & C:** The numbering of reagents is scrambled/confusing. Option C involves a blocking group strategy (sulfonation). Starting with tert-butylbenzene, sulfonation gives the para product, and subsequent nitration gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. In this molecule, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other, which is the wrong relationship for the final product. So, Option C is incorrect.\n*   **Option B:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, Option B is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence carefully.\n    i) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This reaction gives a mixture of products, mainly 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (para) and a smaller amount of **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (ortho). A \"high-yield\" synthesis would not typically rely on a minor product. However, among the given choices, we must explore this possibility. Let's proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer.\n    iii) **Fe/HCl**: The nitro group of 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is a complex step. Direct nitration of anilines with strong acid is often messy. The aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director. The groups are in conflict. However, it is conceivable that nitration is directed to position 3. While sterically hindered, this would lead to the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is the only path among the options that can lead to the correct arrangement of substituents.\n    v) **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt.\n    vi) **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether, yielding the final product **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    viii) **SO3/H2SO4** & ix) **dilute H2SO4**: These last two steps (sulfonation followed by desulfonation) are redundant and make no sense at the end of this synthesis. They are likely included erroneously in the option.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the low yield of the initial ortho-nitration step and the questionable selectivity of the second nitration, the sequence of reagents provided in Option D (ignoring the last two illogical steps) is the only one that can formally produce the required connectivity of the target molecule. The other options fail due to fundamental chemical principles (failure of FC-alkylation on aniline, wrong regiochemistry from blocking group strategy). Therefore, Option D represents the most plausible intended synthetic route, assuming the question allows for steps with poor yields or questionable selectivity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
