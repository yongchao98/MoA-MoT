    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star goes from being unspotted to having 40% of its surface covered by spots.\n    *   **Ratio:** We are interested in $Ratio = N_2 / N_1$, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2, respectively.\n    *   **Factor:** The question asks for $\\frac{Ratio_{\\text{no spots}}}{Ratio_{\\text{spots}}}$. The problem states the ratio *decreases* with spots, so this factor should be greater than 1.\n    *   **Physical Framework:** The problem assumes the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a crucial piece of information, as it allows us to use the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information and Equations:**\n    *   **Boltzmann Equation:** For a gas in LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:\n        $$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T)} $$\n        where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are statistical weights, $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n    *   **Energy Difference:** The energy difference $\\Delta E$ can be found from the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of the transition between the levels:\n        $$ \\Delta E = h \\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n        where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   **Given Data:**\n        *   Temperature without spots: $T_{\\text{no spots}} = 6000$ K.\n        *   Temperature with spots (overall effective temperature): $T_{\\text{spots}} = 5500$ K.\n        *   Wavelength of transition: $\\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n        *   Stellar radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage are also given. I need to determine if they are relevant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Solution Strategy:**\n    *   The problem asks for the factor $\\frac{Ratio_{\\text{no spots}}}{Ratio_{\\text{spots}}}$. Let's write this out using the Boltzmann equation.\n    *   Let $T_1 = T_{\\text{no spots}} = 6000$ K.\n    *   Let $T_2 = T_{\\text{spots}} = 5500$ K. This is the simplest interpretation. The overall effective temperature is a proxy for the characteristic temperature of the photosphere where the spectral lines are formed.\n    *   $Ratio_1 = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}$\n    *   $Ratio_2 = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}$\n    *   The factor is:\n        $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{Ratio_1}{Ratio_2} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} $$\n    *   The statistical weights ($g_2/g_1$) cancel out.\n        $$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})} $$\n    *   This formula has everything I need. The radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage were used to define the state of the star but are not directly needed in the final calculation, as the resulting effective temperatures are given. This confirms they are likely distractor information.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   The calculation involves physical constants ($h, c, k_B$). To ensure high precision and avoid rounding errors, it's best to use a computational tool. I will write a Python script to perform the calculation.\n    *   The script will:\n        1.  Define the constants ($h, c, k_B$).\n        2.  Define the given parameters ($\\lambda, T_1, T_2$).\n        3.  Calculate $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$.\n        4.  Calculate the final factor using the derived formula: $e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1})}$.\n        5.

    "The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two different energy levels changes when a star's surface goes from having no spots to being 40% covered by spots. The problem provides the effective temperatures for both scenarios.\n\n**1. Underlying Physics and Relevant Equation**\n\nThe star's photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Under this condition, the ratio of the population of two energy levels (let's call them level 2 and level 1) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T)} $$\n\n-   $N_2/N_1$ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper level (2) to the lower level (1).\n-   $g_2/g_1$ is the ratio of the statistical weights of the levels, a constant for this specific transition.\n-   $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n-   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n-   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy difference between the levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the transition wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship is:\n\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n\n-   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n-   $c$ is the speed of light.\n-   $\\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n\n**3. Setting up the Ratio of Ratios**\n\nWe are asked for the factor by which the population ratio changes. Let's define the two states:\n-   **State 1 (No spots):** Temperature $T_1 = 6000$ K. The population ratio is $R_1 = \\frac{N_2}{N_1}\\bigg|_{T_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}$.\n-   **State 2 (With spots):** Effective temperature $T_2 = 5500$ K. The population ratio is $R_2 = \\frac{N_2}{N_1}\\bigg|_{T_2} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}$.\n\nThe required factor is the ratio of $R_1$ to $R_2$:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}} $$\n\nThe statistical weights ($g_2/g_1$) cancel out. Using the properties of exponents, we get:\n\n$$ \\text{Factor} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} - (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2})} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)} $$\n\n**4.

A Python script is efficient for this calculation.\n\nThe information about the star's radius, mass, and the 40% spot coverage percentage is contextual. It explains *why* the effective temperature drops, but the calculation itself only requires the initial and final temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) and the transition wavelength.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define physical constants in SI units\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\nk_B = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Define the given parameters\nlambda_val = 1448e-10  # Wavelength in meters (1448 Å)\nT_nospots = 6000       # Temperature of the unspotted star in Kelvin\nT_spots = 5500         # Effective temperature of the spotted star in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the energy difference, Delta_E = h*c / lambda\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_val\n\n# Calculate the exponent term: (Delta_E / k_B) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)\nexponent = (delta_E / k_B) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)\n\n# The factor is the exponential of the exponent term\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 4.506.
