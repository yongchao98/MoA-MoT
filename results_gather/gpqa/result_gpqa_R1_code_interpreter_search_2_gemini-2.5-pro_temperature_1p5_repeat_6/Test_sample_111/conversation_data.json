    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is |alpha> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.\nLet's represent this in vector form, where |up> = (1, 0) and |down> = (0, 1).\n|alpha_unnormalized> = [1+i, 2-i]\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to divide it by its norm. The squared norm is the inner product of the state with itself:\n<alpha_unnormalized|alpha_unnormalized> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)\n= (1² + 1²) + (2² + 1²)\n= (1 + 1) + (4 + 1)\n= 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe norm is sqrt(7). So, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7).\nThe normalized state is:\n|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\nIn vector form: |alpha> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. For a 2x2 system (spin up/down), this gives the matrix:\nA = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = (hbar/2) * σ_x\nwhere σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0\n(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0\nλ² - (hbar²/4) = 0\nλ = ± hbar/2\n\nSo, the two possible measurement outcomes are λ₁ = +hbar/2 and λ₂ = -hbar/2.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n*   For λ₁ = +hbar/2:\n    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0\n    [[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] [x, y]ᵀ = 0\n    This gives the equation -x + y = 0, so x = y.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |λ₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   For λ₂ = -hbar/2:\n    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0\n    [[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] [x, y]ᵀ = 0\n    This gives the equation x + y = 0, so x = -y.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |λ₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue λ is given by P(λ) = |<λ|α>|².\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    P(λ₁) = |<λ₁|α>|²\n    <λ₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i)]\n    = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\n    P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    P(λ₂) = |<λ₂|α>|²\n    <λ₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    = (1/√14) * [(1)(1+i) + (-1)(2-i)]\n    = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value\n\nThe average value of A, denoted <A>, can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues**\n    <A> = Σ λᵢ * P(λᵢ)\n    <A> = (λ₁ * P(λ₁)) + (λ₂ * P(λ₂))\n    <A> = (+hbar/2)*(9/14) + (-hbar/2)*(5/14)\n    <A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula <A> = <α|A|α>**\n    <α| = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i]\n    <A> = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ\n    <A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[2-i], [1+i]]ᵀ\n    <A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]\n    <A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 2i - i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]\n    <A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]\n    <A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]\n    <A> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the two eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. The average value of the operator is hbar/7. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
