    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual facts and chemical properties to identify the unknown substances X, Y, W, G, and B.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** The most concrete clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance G and Liquid Y:**\n    *   Substance G is a precipitate which, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which would look like `M(OD)n -> MxOy + D₂O`. So, **G is a deuterated hydroxide**.\n    *   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to form G. To form a deuterated hydroxide G, the deuterium atoms must come from one of the reactants. The problem states X is \"known for incorporating a heavier isotope\", but the reaction also needs a source of oxygen to form the hydroxide. The most logical source is liquid Y being D₂O itself.\n    *   Thus, **liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:**\n    *   The reaction `X + Y -> G + W` can now be written as `X + D₂O -> deuterated hydroxide(s) + W`.\n    *   W is a gas whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's test common small gas molecules.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible, but unlikely formation pathway)\n        *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but would require X to contain nitrogen, and the reaction doesn't suggest N₂ formation).\n        *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but requires X to contain carbon).\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): A molecule of D₂ consists of two deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, the D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Formation of D₂ gas from a reaction with D₂O is common when using a deuteride reagent (a substance containing D⁻ ions). For example: `M-D + D₂O -> M-OD + D₂`.\n    *   Therefore, **W is D₂ gas**, and X must be a deuteride-containing reagent.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X is a deuteride reagent.\n    *   A critical clue is its reaction in organic chemistry: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a general structure R-CO-COOH. It contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The product having only **2 oxygen atoms** means a reduction has occurred, where one oxygen was removed. Specifically, this points to the reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols:\n        R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent] → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This final diol product has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   A reduction this powerful (reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid) is characteristic of a very strong reducing agent. The most common one used in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   The problem states \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This fits perfectly: LiAlH₄ is the famous analog, and X is its deuterated version.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Scheme with X = LiAlD₄:**\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) reacts violently with D₂O (Y).\n    *   **Equation:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   **Products:**\n        *   G (precipitate) = A mixture of LiOD and Al(OD)₃. This is consistent.\n        *   W (gas) = D₂. This fits the proton/neutron count.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating LiOD and Al(OD)₃ will drive off D₂O (B). This is consistent.\n    *   All pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly.\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question specifies to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these elements. We should use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes present.\n        *   Mass of the isotope of Hydrogen present (Deuterium, D or ²H) = 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of the main isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n    *   **Contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (mass from H) + (mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n```python\n# Final calculation to confirm the arithmetic.\n# Substance X is LiAlD4.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (isotope is Deuterium, D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n\n# Mass number of Deuterium (D)\nmass_D = 2\n# Number of Deuterium atoms\nnum_D = 4\n\n# Mass number of Aluminum (Al)\nmass_Al = 27\n# Number of Aluminum atoms\nnum_Al = 1\n\n# Calculate the total mass from the lightest element's isotopes\ntotal_mass_lightest = num_D * mass_D\n\n# Calculate the total mass from the heaviest element's isotopes\ntotal_mass_heaviest = num_Al * mass_Al\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_lightest + total_mass_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, leading to the chemical formula of Substance X, from which the final calculation can be made.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The most definitive clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very close match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substances G and Y:**\n    *   Substance G is a precipitate that releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a deuterated hydroxide, e.g., Metal(OD)x → Metal Oxide + D₂O. So, G is a deuterated metal hydroxide or a mixture of them.\n    *   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to form this deuterated hydroxide (G). The deuterium must come from X or Y. Since B is D₂O, it is highly probable that the reactant **liquid Y is also D₂O**.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:**\n    *   The reaction is now inferred to be `X + D₂O (Y) → G + W`.\n    *   Gas W is described as a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine possibilities:\n        *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible, but formation is unlikely).\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits perfectly, especially since we've already identified D₂O in the reaction scheme.\n    *   The reaction `X + D₂O → deuterated hydroxide + D₂` is characteristic of a metal deuteride reacting with heavy water. Therefore, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   X must be a deuteride-containing compound.\n    *   The organic chemistry clue is critical: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**. The reaction product only has **2 oxygen atoms**. This means the substance underwent a reduction where an oxygen was removed, specifically the reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the ketone was also reduced to a secondary alcohol. This overall reduction (R-CO-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   The clue \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards a very common, strong reducing agent. The most famous one capable of reducing carboxylic acids is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   Since substance X contains a heavier isotope, it must be the deuterated version of LiAlH₄.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Entire Reaction:**\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. The products match our deductions: G is a mixture of deuterated hydroxides, and W is deuterium gas. Heating the precipitate G (especially Al(OD)₃) would drive off D₂O (B). All clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule, using their isotopic masses.\n        *   There are 4 atoms of the lightest element's isotope (Deuterium, D). The mass number of D is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   There is 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum, Al). The mass number of the most common isotope is 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n```python\n# The identified substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope Deuterium, D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminum (Al).\n\n# The mass number of the Deuterium isotope (D) is 2.\n# The mass number of the Aluminum isotope (Al) is 27.\n\n# The formula LiAlD4 contains 4 atoms of Deuterium and 1 atom of Aluminum.\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium).\nmass_from_lightest = 4 * 2\n\n# Calculate the total mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum).\nmass_from_heaviest = 1 * 27\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\ncumulative_mass = mass_from_lightest + mass_from_heaviest\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
