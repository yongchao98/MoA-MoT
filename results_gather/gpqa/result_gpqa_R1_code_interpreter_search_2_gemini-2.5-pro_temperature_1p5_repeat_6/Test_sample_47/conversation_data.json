    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. The reaction typically occurs at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, one of the α-hydrogens of cyclohexanone is substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   Reactant: Cyclohexanone\n*   Reagent: Br₂\n*   Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone. This molecule has a stereocenter at carbon 2, so a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-bromocyclohexanone is formed.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis reaction involves an α-haloketone and a strong base (NaOH), which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon on the other side of the carbonyl group (C6). This forms an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-7-one.\n3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.\n4.  This intermediate collapses, and the bicyclic ring opens to relieve ring strain. The bond between C1 and C6 (or C1 and C2) breaks, leading to the formation of a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n5.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate and carbanion (during workup) yields a cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The carbon skeleton has contracted from a 6-membered ring to a 5-membered ring.\n*   Reactant: 2-Bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   Reagent: NaOH, heat\n*   Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nAn alternative reaction could be E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the Favorskii rearrangement is a very common and expected pathway under these conditions, and the subsequent reactions align well with the product of the Favorskii rearrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride converts the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid into a chloro group (-Cl). Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct generated during the reaction.\n*   Reactant: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   Reagent: SOCl₂ / Pyridine\n*   Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. A stronger reducing agent like LiAlH₄ would reduce the acid chloride all the way to the alcohol. The choice of this specific reagent is a strong indicator that the reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   Reactant: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   Reagent: LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Chemically distinct hydrogens have unique chemical environments and will produce separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\nThe molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs) that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and its H), the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO)**: This proton lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1**: This is the proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group. This proton also lies on the plane of symmetry. It is unique. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5**: The plane of symmetry makes carbon C2 equivalent to carbon C5. On each of these carbons, there are two protons. Let's consider the two protons on C2. Due to the presence of the substituent on C1, these two protons are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is cis and one is trans (in a simplified view) to the aldehyde group, and they cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. The symmetry plane relates the 'cis' proton on C2 to the 'cis' proton on C5, making them one set. It relates the 'trans' proton on C2 to the 'trans' proton on C5, making them another set. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types of H)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4**: The plane of symmetry makes carbon C3 equivalent to carbon C4. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the two upper protons equivalent and the two lower protons equivalent. Thus, the four protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types of H)\n\nTotaling these up:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 Hs) + 2 (from C3/C4 Hs) = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
