    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the first reaction.**\n*   **Reactant A:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene derivative, which can act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. It has two double bonds.\n*   **Reactant B precursor:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) and heat.\n\nThe reaction of 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl) compounds with reagents like NaI is a standard method for generating highly reactive conjugated systems. In this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is analogous to precursors used to generate o-xylylene. The reaction with NaI causes debromination to form two exocyclic double bonds.\nThe precursor has a cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring, with -CHBr2 groups at the adjacent sp3-hybridized C5 and C6 positions. The reaction is:\nC4H4(CH)(CHBr2)2 + 4 NaI → C8H8 + 4 NaBr + 2 I2\nThe C8H8 product formed is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, which we will call **D**. This is a reactive diene.\n\nThe first step of the synthesis is the reaction of Reactant A with 2 equivalents of D. D acts as a diene, and the double bonds of the norbornadiene (Reactant A) act as dienophiles. Two sequential Diels-Alder reactions occur, one at each double bond of the norbornadiene, to form a bis-adduct, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2.**\n*   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\nThis is a standard acidic hydrolysis condition for a tert-butyl ether. The 7-(tert-butoxy) group (-O-tBu) is cleaved to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 2** is the same bis-adduct skeleton as Product 1, but with a secondary alcohol at the C7 position.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3.**\n*   Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO.\nThis is the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild reagent system for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol in Product 2 is oxidized to a ketone.\n*   **Product 3** is the bis-adduct with a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C7 position.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the final product, 4.**\n*   Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\nProduct 3 is a Diels-Alder adduct. Heating Diels-Alder adducts often causes a reverse reaction, known as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The high temperature favors the formation of smaller, gaseous molecules due to entropy.\nProduct 3 will decompose via two sequential retro-Diels-Alder reactions to regenerate the two molecules of diene (D) and the core dienophile, which would be 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (7-ketonorbornadiene).\nThis intermediate, 7-ketonorbornadiene, is known to be extremely unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic extrusion of carbon monoxide (CO) to form benzene. This process is very favorable and happens rapidly upon formation.\nSo, the overall reaction in this step is:\nProduct 3 → 2 **D** + Benzene + CO\nThe final stable organic products in the reaction vessel are benzene and D (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene). The question asks for the number of distinct hydrogen atoms on \"final product 4\". Given the options, it is referring to one of these organic products.\n*   Benzene (C6H6) has only one type of hydrogen atom due to its high symmetry. This is not among the options.\n*   **D** (**5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**, C8H8) is the other product. Let's analyze its structure and symmetry to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Analysis of Product D (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene)**\n\nThe structure of D is a six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds at C5 and C6.\n\n```\n       H-C4=C3-H\n          /   \\\n (H2=)C5 ----- C2-H\n       |       ||\n (H2=)C6 ----- C1-H\n```\n(where C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, C2 to C1 and C3, etc., forming the ring)\n\nLet's analyze its symmetry. Assuming the molecule is planar, it possesses C2v symmetry.\n*   A C2 axis passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   A mirror plane (σv) contains the atoms C1, H(on C1), C4, H(on C4) and the two exocyclic CH2 groups.\n*   Another mirror plane (σv') is perpendicular to the first and contains the C2 axis.\n\nNow, let's determine the sets of equivalent hydrogen atoms based on these symmetry operations:\n1.  The hydrogen on C1 (H1) and the hydrogen on C4 (H4) are interconverted by the C2 axis. They form one set of equivalent protons.\n2.  The hydrogen on C2 (H2) and the hydrogen on C3 (H3) are interconverted by the C2 axis. They form a second, distinct set.\n3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH2) at C5 and C6 are equivalent; they are interconverted by the C2 axis. Within each methylene group, the two protons are not equivalent. One proton is geometrically closer to the C1=C2 side of the molecule (let's call it H_in), and the other is further away (H_out). These are diastereotopic because of the overall molecular asymmetry relative to the C=C bond.\n    *   The two \"inner\" protons (one at C5, one at C6) are equivalent to each other due to the C2 symmetry. This is the third set of equivalent protons.\n    *   The two \"outer\" protons (one at C5, one at C6) are equivalent to each other. This is the fourth set.\n\nIn total, there are **4** sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\nNote: While D is reactive and could potentially dimerize at 150°C, the dimerization product would be complex and likely asymmetric, or would require specific assumptions about its structure to match any of the other options. The most straightforward interpretation is that \"Product 4\" refers to D, a primary product of the final reaction step, which has a number of distinct hydrogens matching one of the choices. Furthermore, rearrangement of D (C8H8) to an aromatic compound like xylene (C8H10) is not possible as it requires a change in the molecular formula.\n\nTherefore, the final product in question has 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
