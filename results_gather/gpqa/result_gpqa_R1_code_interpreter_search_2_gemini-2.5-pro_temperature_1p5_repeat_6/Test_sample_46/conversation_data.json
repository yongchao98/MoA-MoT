    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one other pi bond (likely a C=O double bond).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its frequency is typical for a conjugated ester. Aromatic esters (where the C=O is conjugated with the benzene ring) absorb in the 1730-1715 cm⁻¹ range. This fits perfectly. An amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (typically < 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet at a very downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which confirms the interpretation of the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The fact that they are both doublets and each integrates to 2H strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) means one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield). An amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, and an ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing. The protons ortho to the -NH2 group would be at the higher field (7.0 ppm), and the protons ortho to the ester would be at the lower field (8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together and evaluating the options:**\n    *   The evidence points to a structure with a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   This leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide (wrong C=O IR freq), is meta-substituted (wrong NMR splitting pattern), and has an ethoxy group on the ring (wrong NMR chemical shifts).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This has a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a para-substituted ring. All spectral data (IR and NMR) are a perfect match for this structure. The molecular formula C9H11NO2 also matches.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the oxygen is attached to the ring, and the ethyl group is part of the propionyl group. The -CH2- of the ethyl group would be adjacent to a C=O and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, so it would only have one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It also lacks the -NH2 group indicated by the NMR signal at 4.0 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
