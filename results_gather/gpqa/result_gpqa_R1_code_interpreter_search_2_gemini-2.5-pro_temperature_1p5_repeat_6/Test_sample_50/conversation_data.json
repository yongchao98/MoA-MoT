    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. \"Grounded\" means the potential of the sphere is held at zero (`V=0`).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem can be simplified using the method of images. We can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`). The electrostatic field and potential *outside* the sphere are then correctly described by the superposition of the fields from `q` and `q'`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (also from the center, along the same line as `q`) are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. There are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n    **Method 1: Using the Work Integral (U = -∫F•dl)**\n    This is generally more complex. We would need to calculate the force on the charge `q` at an arbitrary position `x` as it's brought in from infinity (`F(x)`) and then integrate.\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Electrostatic Energy Formula**\n    A more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a system of charges and conductors: `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    *   In our case, the total energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`.\n    *   Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. So the second term vanishes.\n    *   The formula simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   Here, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) that is created by the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\n5.  **Find the Induced Potential (V_induced):**\n    *   According to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere's surface is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   So, we need to calculate the potential produced by the image charge `q'` at the position of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   Let's substitute the value of `b`:\n        Distance = `d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Now, the potential `V_induced` at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V_induced = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   Now substitute this `V_induced` back into our energy formula: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, has `R^2`)\n    *   B) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)` (Incorrect, missing `1/2` and has `d` instead of `R`)\n    *   C) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)` (**Correct**)\n    *   D) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)` (Incorrect, wrong numerator and denominator)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
