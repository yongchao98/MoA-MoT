    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left(\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}\\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance for a circular orbit), and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    For the three planets orbiting the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem states that the albedo $A$ is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the term $T_{star} (R_{star}/2)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$ is a constant for all three planets.\n\n    This means that the equilibrium temperature $T_{eq}$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance $a$:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n2.  **Use the temperature ratios to find the ratios of orbital distances.**\n    From the relationship above, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets (i and j) is:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\left(\\frac{a_j}{a_i}\\right)^{1/2}$\n    We can square both sides to find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}}\\right)^2$\n\n    We are given:\n    - $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n    - $\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n\n    Let's find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n    - $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}\\right)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n    - $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}}\\right)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3/a_1$).**\n    We can find this by multiplying the two ratios we just calculated:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n4.  **Relate the orbital period to the orbital distance using Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n    This relationship assumes the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard assumption in such problems. The provided mass ratios are distractors, as is the mention of the TTV method, which is simply context for how such planets might be discovered and their masses estimated.\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($P_3/P_1$).**\n    Using the relationship from Kepler's Law:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the value of $a_3/a_1$ we found in step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{1.5}$\n\n    To calculate this, we can take the square root of 10.3684 and then cube the result, or cube 10.3684 and then take the square root. An alternative is to calculate $(1.4 \\times 2.3)^3$:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\frac{P_3}{P_2} \\times \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{a_3}{a_2}\\right)^{3/2} \\times \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{3/2} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}}\\right)^2\\right)^{3/2} \\times \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}\\right)^2\\right)^{3/2}$\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}\\right)^3 = 2.3^3 \\times 1.4^3 = (2.3 \\times 1.4)^3 = 3.22^3$\n    $3.22^3 = 33.386248$\n\n    This value is approximately 33.4.\n\nTo ensure precision, we can use a calculator for the final computation.\n\n```python\n# Ratios of equilibrium temperatures\nT_ratio_12 = 1.4\nT_ratio_23 = 2.3\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods P3/P1 can be calculated as (T1/T2 * T2/T3)^3.\n# Let T_ratio_13 be the ratio of T1 to T3\nT_ratio_13 = T_ratio_12 * T_ratio_23\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods P3/P1 is T_ratio_13^3\nP_ratio_31 = T_ratio_13**3\n\nprint(P_ratio_31)\n```\n<execute_code>\n33.386248\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 33.4. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and its orbital semi-major axis ($a$) is given by:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two planets (planet i and planet j) is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_j}{a_i}}$\n\nKepler's Third Law relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\nThe ratio of orbital periods for two planets is:\n$\\frac{P_j}{P_i} = \\left(\\frac{a_j}{a_i}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\nWe can combine these two relationships. From the temperature ratio, we have:\n$\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstituting this into the period ratio equation:\n$\\frac{P_j}{P_i} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}}\\right)^2\\right)^{3/2} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}}\\right)^3$\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio $P_3/P_1$. We can write this as a product of the known ratios:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\frac{P_3}{P_2} \\cdot \\frac{P_2}{P_1}$\n\nUsing the formula we derived:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}\\right)^3$\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}}\\right)^3$\n\nWe are given:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n$\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n\nTherefore:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}\\right)^3 = (2.3)^3 \\cdot (1.4)^3 = (2.3 \\times 1.4)^3$\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n$2.3 \\times 1.4 = 3.22$\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information about the mass ratios and the albedo value is extra information not needed for the calculation, as Kepler's third law in its simple form assumes planetary mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, and the albedo cancels out since it's the same for all planets.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 10.4\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
