    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference. It is considered stationary.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the rest frame of the glass. It is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n2.  **Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S'):**\n    *   The index of refraction `n` of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n    *   `n = c / u'`\n    *   The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured by an observer in the glass's frame (S'), is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n    *   Since the light beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, we take this velocity `u'` as positive.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    *   The problem requires finding the speed of the light beam as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This scenario involves adding velocities in special relativity.\n    *   The formula for adding two velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n        where:\n        *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the laboratory frame (S).\n        *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S').\n        *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n        *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We have `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The velocity of the glass is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light in vacuum is `c = 1`.\n    *   Substituting these values into the velocity addition formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   First, simplify the denominator:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n        `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n        `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n        `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nA) 1: Incorrect. The speed of light is only `c=1` in a vacuum.\nB) (1-n*v)/(n+v): Incorrect sign in the numerator.\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v): Correct.\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v): Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n\n<<<C>>>"
