    "The user wants me to identify the biological process responsible for high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in Peyer's patches after antigen exposure.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the scenario:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Inner capsid proteins of rotavirus (tagged with GFP).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, leading to exposure in the gastrointestinal tract.\n    *   **Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, a key site for mucosal immune responses.\n    *   **Cell population:** Proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. This indicates an active immune response where lymphocytes (likely B cells) that have recognized the antigen are dividing rapidly.\n    *   **Key observation:** Sequencing of the *variable heavy chain gene* from these cells shows *high variability*. This means that the genes encoding the antigen-binding part of the antibody are undergoing mutation.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options in the context of the scenario:**\n\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate and humoral immune response involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve any genetic changes in lymphocytes. It cannot explain the variability in the heavy chain gene. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism by which the immune system adapts to a new foreign element. It occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM diversifies the B cell receptors used to recognize foreign elements (antigens) by introducing point mutations into the variable region genes of immunoglobulins, including the heavy chain. The goal is to select for B cells with higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly causes \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of \"proliferating cells\" in a \"secondary lymphoid organ\" following antigen encounter. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n    *   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of antigen receptors in immature B cells (and T cells). It occurs in the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. While it creates variability, it's a one-time event for each developing lymphocyte. The process described in the question is happening in mature, proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA). However, it does *not* alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The question specifically states the variability is in the *variable heavy chain gene*. So, D is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen challenge is the classic definition of somatic hypermutation, a key feature of the germinal center reaction aimed at affinity maturation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
