    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and equilibria:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, denoted as c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species. The relevant equilibria are:\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] (the blue complex)\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])  =>  [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n    *   β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) =>  [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n    *   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) =>  [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n    *   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) =>  [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n4.  **Substitute these expressions into the total concentration equation:**\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n    Factor out [Co²⁺]:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n5.  **Determine the fraction of the desired complex:**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. The fraction of this species (α₂) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n    The [Co²⁺] term cancels out:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    We can use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * SCN_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * SCN_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * SCN_conc**4\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the complex of interest, [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = term2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.916180326482278\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is approximately 16.9%. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user has asked for the solution to a chemical equilibrium problem. I have already provided the reasoning and a Python calculation in the previous step. The output of the Python code confirmed the manual calculation.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n1.  The problem involves the stepwise formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes.\n2.  The goal is to find the percentage of a specific species, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total amount of cobalt in the solution.\n3.  The fraction of any given complex, αₙ, can be calculated using the formula:\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n    where L is the ligand (SCN⁻), βᵢ are the overall stability constants, and the sum is from i=1 to the maximum coordination number (in this case, 4).\n4.  We need to calculate α₂ for the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n6.  The Python code calculated this fraction and converted it to a percentage:\n    *   Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Denominator = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)² + 63*(0.1)³ + 16*(0.1)⁴ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n    *   α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   Percentage = α₂ * 100 ≈ 16.916%\n7.  This result matches option C.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed to calculate the *percentage distribution* of the species, as the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] cancels out from the fraction calculation. The condition that [SCN⁻] (0.1 M) is much larger than c(Co) (0.01 M) validates the assumption that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the initial total ligand concentration.\n\nThe calculation is robust and the result is clear.\n\n<<<C>>>"
