    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the key concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This assumption implies that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant throughout space. `ρ = Number of stars / Volume`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift of a star's position due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. Mathematically, `plx = 1/d`. This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` centered on the Sun.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) can be approximated as the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on the parallax (`plx`). To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with their parallax equivalents in the equation for `dN`.\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -d(plx) / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as the distance (`d`) increases, the parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the change, so we can ignore the negative sign: `dd = d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx) / plx²) `\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   Divide both sides of the equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN / d(plx)`) is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
