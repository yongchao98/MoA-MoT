    "This problem requires finding the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. We will derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\nThe scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` at a position `r` and time `t` due to a charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, $t_r$ is the **retarded time**, defined by the condition that the signal (light) emitted from the source at `r'` at time $t_r$ must travel the distance $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|$ to reach the observer at `r` at time `t`.\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities are:\n\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta function.\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n*   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$: $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|/c$. This makes the integration non-trivial.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nTo evaluate the integral, one must account for the change in volume element due to the time-dependency inside the delta function. The standard derivation (found in textbooks like Griffiths' \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\") shows that the integral gives:\n$\\int \\dfrac{G(\\vec{r'}) \\delta(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{G(\\vec{r'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nwhere all terms in the square brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nLet's use the problem's notation:\n*   $\\vec{w} = \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the retarded position of the charge.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the retarded velocity.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{w}$ is the vector from the retarded position to the field point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$.\n\nThe retarded time condition is $c(t-t_r) = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| = d$.\n\nApplying the result of the integration:\n\nFor the scalar potential `V`, the function $G(\\vec{r'})$ is just 1.\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential `A`, the function $G(\\vec{r'})$ is $\\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n*   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A. (Note: The option uses $\\mu$ which is understood to be $\\mu_o$ in this context).\n\nLet's check the other options:\n*   B and C use the static potential form $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which ignores the retardation effect and is incorrect. The distance should be the retarded distance `d`, and the denominator has an additional velocity-dependent term.\n*   D has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}$), which would correspond to advanced potentials (violating causality) rather than the physical retarded potentials.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
