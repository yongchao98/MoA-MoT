    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The epoxide is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1 and C6 positions. The molecule has methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The absolute configurations of the chiral centers are specified as 1R, 3R, 4R, and 6S.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. In this reagent, the nucleophilic species is effectively a methyl carbanion equivalent (CH3-), which acts as a soft nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The problem explicitly states the key rules for this reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The problem states: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by the oxygen atom (O7) and carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring structure. It is a tertiary carbon.\n    *   Carbon C6 has no substituent other than the ring atoms and hydrogens. It is a secondary carbon.\n*   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The nucleophilic methyl group (CH3-) from Me2CuLi will attack at **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n*   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an SN2-type mechanism.\n*   The nucleophile attacks C6. The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(6S)**.\n*   Due to the inversion of configuration, the stereocenter at this carbon in the product will have the opposite configuration, which is **(R)**.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n*   The attack of CH3- at C6 causes the C6-O bond to break. The electrons from this bond move to the oxygen atom.\n*   This results in an alkoxide intermediate, with the new methyl group attached to C6 and an O- group attached to C1.\n*   A subsequent workup step (usually with mild acid) protonates the alkoxide to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol. Let's determine the positions of all groups based on IUPAC nomenclature for the product:\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) defines the principal functional group, so the carbon it's attached to (the original C1) is now **C1** of the product.\n    *   The original methyl group on C1 remains on **C1**.\n    *   The new methyl group, which attacked the original C6, is on the carbon adjacent to C1. This carbon (the original C6) is now **C2**.\n    *   The other methyl groups were at C3 and C4 of the reactant. To maintain the lowest locant numbers, the original C4 becomes **C4** and the original C3 becomes **C5**. (Numbering C1->C2->C3(orig C5)->C4(orig C4)->C5(orig C3)... gives the set 1,2,4,5 which is the lowest possible).\n*   Thus, the product's constitution is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethyl).\n\n**5. Determine the Absolute Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   We need to determine the configuration (R or S) for each chiral center in the product (C1, C2, C4, C5).\n    *   **C1:** This stereocenter was not directly involved in the bond-breaking/formation. Its configuration is retained. Original configuration was (1R), so the product is **(1R)**.\n    *   **C2 (from original C6):** This is the site of nucleophilic attack. As determined in step 3, its configuration is inverted from (6S) to **(R)**. So the product is **(2R)**.\n    *   **C4 (from original C4):** This stereocenter was not involved in the reaction. Its configuration is retained. Original configuration was (4R), so the product is **(4R)**.\n    *   **C5 (from original C3):** This stereocenter was not involved in the reaction. Its configuration is retained. Original configuration was (3R), so the product is **(5R)**.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Product Name and Choose the Correct Option**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the absolute configurations, the final product is:\n    **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**\n*   Comparing this name with the given options:\n    *   A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   The calculated product perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
