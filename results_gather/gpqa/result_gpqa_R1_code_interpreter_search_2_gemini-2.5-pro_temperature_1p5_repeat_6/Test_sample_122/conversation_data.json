    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Ejecta's Frame:** This is the moving frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's the frame where the clock is at rest. We are given `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Galaxy's Frame:** This is the stationary frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as observed from this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Relative velocity between the frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time (time in the ejecta's frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 299,792.458 km/s`.\n\n**3. The Concept of Time Dilation:**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time interval measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n\nThe formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nWhere the Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**4. Calculation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).**\n    To do this, we first need to calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n    \n    `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    `c ≈ 299,792.458 km/s`\n    \n    `v/c = 60,000 / 299,792.458 ≈ 0.200138`\n    \n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.200138)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.040055) = 1 / sqrt(0.959945) ≈ 1.02065`\n    \n    Now, calculate the dilated time `Δt`:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02065 * 50 s ≈ 51.0325 s`\n    \n    This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.0325 seconds.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.**\n    The distance traveled (`d`) is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time interval measured in the same frame (`Δt`).\n    \n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.0325 s`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,950 km`\n\nThis value is very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\nTo get a more precise result without rounding, we can perform the calculation in a single step.\n\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * (Δt₀ / sqrt(1 - v²/c²))`\n\nLet's use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nt0 = 50     # s\nc = 299792.458 # km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate gamma (Lorentz factor)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\nt_galaxy = gamma * t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_galaxy = v * t_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"{distance_galaxy=}\")\n```\nExecuting this code gives the result:\n`distance_galaxy=3061950.912668506`\n\nThis result, `3,061,950.9 km`, is extremely close to option A. The minor discrepancy is likely because the problem uses a rounded value for the speed of light (e.g., 300,000 km/s), which simplifies `v/c` to exactly 0.2. Let's verify:\n\nIf `v/c = 0.2`, then `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n`d = 60000 * 50 / sqrt(0.96) = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\nBoth precise and simplified calculations point to option A being the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame:** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta from this perspective.\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame:** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time given, 50 seconds, is measured in this frame. Time measured in the frame of the object itself is known as the **proper time (`Δt₀`)**.\n*   **Special Relativity:** Because the velocity of the ejecta (`v = 60,000 km/s`) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), we cannot use classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`). We must account for relativistic effects, specifically **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Understand Time Dilation:**\n\n*   Time dilation is a phenomenon where time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer.\n*   The time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is longer than the time elapsed in the moving frame (`Δt₀`).\n*   The formula relating these two times is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n*   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Distance:**\n\n*   The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n*   Substituting the time dilation formula into the distance formula, we get:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation:**\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 299,792.458 km/s`\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity) for comparison.**\n    `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    This corresponds to option C. However, we know that due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame will be *longer* than 50 seconds, so the actual distance traveled must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options B, C, and D, making A the only possible answer.\n\n*   **Step 2: Confirm with the full relativistic calculation.**\n    We can use the result from the Python code execution:\n    `distance_galaxy = v * Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 3,061,950 km`\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with the options.**\n    The calculated distance of `3,061,950 km` is closest to option A.\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe small difference between the calculated value and option A is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\n<<<A>>>"
