    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a quantum system in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Uncertainty:** In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty (or standard deviation) of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The problem also provides matrices for $P_x$ and $P_y$ and states that $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $P_x$. This information is useful for context and to confirm the consistency of the problem, but it is not directly needed for the calculation of $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation Plan:** To find $\\Delta P_z$, I need to compute two quantities:\n    a. The expectation value of $P_z$, which is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    b. The expectation value of $P_z^2$, which is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation - Step by Step:**\n\n    **Step 5.1: Find the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$**\n    The bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose.\n    $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    **Step 5.2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n    First, let's compute the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\n    **Step 5.3: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, compute the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n    **Step 5.4: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n    Now substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n6.  **Alternative Method (using eigenvalues and probabilities):**\n    The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the operator $P_z$ matrix is diagonal. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are the diagonal elements: $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, $\\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$.\n    The state $|\\psi\\rangle$ can be written as a superposition of these eigenvectors:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = c_1 |v_1\\rangle + c_2 |v_2\\rangle + c_3 |v_3\\rangle$\n    where the coefficients are the components of the state vector: $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, $c_3 = -1/2$.\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ is $P_i = |c_i|^2$.\n    $P(\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n    $P(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n    $P(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n    (Check normalization: $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$)\n\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i P_i \\lambda_i = (1/4)(\\hbar) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\\hbar) = 0$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i P_i \\lambda_i^2 = (1/4)(\\hbar^2) + (1/2)(0^2) + (1/4)((-\\hbar)^2) = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/2 - 0} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n    Both methods give the same result, increasing confidence in the answer.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated uncertainty is $\\Delta P_z = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\n    B) $\\hbar/2$\n    C) $\\hbar$\n    D) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\n\n    The result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
