    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars (let's call it `N`) and their parallax (`plx`). This relationship is `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) depends on the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts and Relationships:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is a measure of a star's apparent shift in position as the Earth orbits the Sun.\n    *   **Distance (r):** The distance from the observer to the star.\n    *   **The fundamental relationship between parallax and distance:** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. For simplicity and standard astronomical units (distance `r` in parsecs, parallax `plx` in arcseconds), the relationship is `r = 1/plx`, which means `plx = 1/r`.\n    *   **Interpreting \"number of stars\":** The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as...\" typically refers to the *cumulative* number of stars observed that have a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`. This is equivalent to counting all stars *within* a certain distance `r`. Let's denote this cumulative number as `N(<r)`.\n\n3.  **Translate the Given Information:**\n    *   The given relationship is `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   Based on our interpretation, this means the cumulative number of stars up to a distance `r` (which corresponds to a minimum parallax `plx`) follows this rule.\n    *   So, `N(<r) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars in Terms of Distance (r):**\n    *   We know `plx = 1/r`. Let's substitute this into the relationship from step 3.\n    *   `N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n    *   This equation tells us that the total number of stars within a radius `r` is proportional to `r^5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the mathematical equivalent of the derivative of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, `dN/dr`. This represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n    *   We start with the proportionality `N(<r) ∝ r^5`. We can write this as an equation with a constant of proportionality, `k`: `N(<r) = k * r^5`.\n    *   Now, we differentiate `N(<r)` with respect to `r`:\n    *   `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    *   Applying the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    *   `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1) = 5 * k * r^4`\n\n6.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    *   From the result of the differentiation, we can see that `dN/dr` is proportional to `r^4`.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n7.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   The result `~ r^4` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
