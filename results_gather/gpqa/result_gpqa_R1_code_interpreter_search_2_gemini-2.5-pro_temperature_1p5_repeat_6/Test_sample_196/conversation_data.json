    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). The broadness ('bs') is also typical. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, both doublets and integrating to two protons each, strongly suggest a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons *ortho* to the other substituent (which must be an electron-donating group, like an alkyl group).\n        *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Side Chain:**\n            *   Let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the alkyl group:\n                *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n                *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n                *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) with multiple different neighbors. It's next to the CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the CH at 2.9 ppm.\n                *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H suggests a methine group (-CH-) with multiple different neighbors. Its chemical shift indicates it is the benzylic proton (the one directly attached to the benzene ring).\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We can piece together these fragments. The benzylic carbon (CH) is attached to the ring, a methyl group (giving the 1.4 ppm doublet), and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The ethyl group gives rise to the 1.7 ppm multiplet (for -CH₂-) and the 0.9 ppm triplet (for -CH₃). This entire assembly is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, we have a benzoic acid substituted at the para position (position 4) with a sec-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (A).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is: R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the I₂ byproduct.\n    *   **Product Prediction:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will remain unchanged.\n        *   Starting material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted product.\n    *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure. The reaction is a reduction, not a rearrangement, and the -COOH group should be gone.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is isobutyl, not sec-butyl. The alkyl chain does not rearrange in this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n<<<B>>>"
