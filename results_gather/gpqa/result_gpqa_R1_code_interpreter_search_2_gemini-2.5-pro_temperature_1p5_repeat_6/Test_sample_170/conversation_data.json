    "Answering the question requires us to determine the yield of the para-isomer in the electrophilic bromination of six different substituted benzene compounds. The yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors: the directing effect of the substituent (ortho/para vs. meta) and steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effects.**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) as either ortho,para-directing or meta-directing.\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These include activating groups and halogens.\n    *   1) -CH3 (methyl group in toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (ethyl group in ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (chlorine in chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. These are generally deactivating groups.\n    *   4) -NO2 (nitro group in nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (carboxyl group in benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (ester group in ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the para-isomer yields.**\n\nA general rule is that meta-directing substituents yield very small amounts of the para-isomer, while ortho,para-directing substituents yield significant amounts. Therefore, the substances with meta-directors will come first in the order of increasing para-yield, followed by the substances with ortho,para-directors.\n\nSo, the order will be: {nitrobenzene(4), benzoic acid(6), ethyl benzoate(2)} < {chlorobenzene(3), toluene(1), ethylbenzene(5)}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the substances within each group.**\n\n**A) Ordering the meta-directors (4, 6, 2):**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, leading to a smaller percentage of ortho and para products.\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4)**: The -NO2 group is the strongest deactivator in this list. It will therefore produce the lowest yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2)**: The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar, strong deactivating effects. Their relative ordering can be subtle, but both will produce more para-isomer than nitrobenzene but far less than the o,p-directors. Most sources indicate that the para yield for benzoic acid is slightly lower than for ethyl benzoate, but both are very small. Let's compare the options later. For now, we know the order starts with 4.\n\n**B) Ordering the ortho,para-directors (3, 1, 5):**\nFor ortho,para-directing groups, the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer is primarily determined by steric hindrance. The incoming electrophile (the bromonium ion, likely complexed with the Lewis acid catalyst, e.g., Br-FeBr3) is bulky. A bulkier substituent on the benzene ring will block the ortho positions more effectively, thus favoring attack at the less-hindered para position.\nLet's rank the steric bulk (size) of the o,p-directing substituents:\n-C2H5 > -CH3 > -Cl\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is the bulkiest of the three. It will cause the most steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to the highest percentage of the para-isomer.\n*   **Toluene (1)**: The methyl group (-CH3) is less bulky than ethyl but more bulky than chlorine. It will give a lower para-yield than ethylbenzene.\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3)**: The chlorine atom (-Cl) is the smallest of these three groups. It will offer the least steric hindrance to ortho-attack, resulting in the lowest percentage of the para-isomer among the o,p-directors.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n**Step 4: Combine the orders and select the correct option.**\n\nCombining our findings:\n1.  The overall order is {meta-directors} < {ortho,para-directors}.\n2.  The order for meta-directors begins with nitrobenzene (4).\n3.  The order for ortho,para-directors is 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nSo, the complete sequence must end with `... < 3 < 1 < 5`. Let's check the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4 - Incorrect ending.\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - Incorrect ending.\nC) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect ending.\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - This option correctly identifies nitrobenzene (4) as having a very low yield and, most importantly, has the correct relative order for the ortho,para-directors (3 < 1 < 5) at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe full order proposed by option D is:\nNO2 < COOC2H5 < COOH < Cl < CH3 < C2H5\n(4) < (2) < (6) < (3) < (1) < (5)\n\nThis order is fully consistent with our analysis of steric effects for the o,p-directors and places the m-directors at the beginning with the lowest yields.\n\n<<<D>>>"
