    "Here is the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The problem describes the relative population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of two stars. The key information is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This indicates that the distribution of atoms across different energy states can be described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write Down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (say, an excited state `e` and a ground state `g`) to the temperature `T` of the system.\n    N_e / N_g = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   `N_e`, `N_g` are the number of atoms in the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `g_e`, `g_g` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the states (`E_e - E_g`).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** We have two stars, star_1 with temperature `T_1` and star_2 with temperature `T_2`. We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star for the same pair of energy levels.\n\n    *   For star_1:  (N_e / N_g)_1 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For star_2:  (N_e / N_g)_2 = (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem Statement:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state for star_1 is twice that for star_2.\n    (N_e / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_e / N_g)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the Boltzmann equations from step 3 into the relationship from step 4.\n    (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n6.  **Simplify the Combined Equation:**\n    *   The statistical weight ratio `(g_e / g_g)` is the same for both stars (since it's the same atomic transition) and cancels out from both sides.\n        exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, we can isolate the exponential terms. Divide both sides by `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`:\n        exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n    *   Using the exponent rule `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n        exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ] = 2\n        exp[ (ΔE / (k * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] = 2\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = 2\n\n7.  **Isolate the Temperature Term:** Take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides to remove the exponential function.\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Incorporate the Given Numerical Values:** The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE` as approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n    This clever choice of value simplifies the equation significantly. Substituting this back into our equation:\n    1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Final Algebraic Manipulation:** Combine the fractions in the parenthesis to match the format of the options.\n    *   Find a common denominator: `T_1 * T_2`.\n    *   `1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = T_1/(T_1*T_2) - T_2/(T_1*T_2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)`\n    *   So, the final equation is:\n        ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
