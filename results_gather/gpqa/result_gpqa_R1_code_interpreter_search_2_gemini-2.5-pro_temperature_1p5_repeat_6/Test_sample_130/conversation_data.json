    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond.\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, and its dehydration yields the cyclic maleic anhydride. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinyl protons equivalent (appearing as a singlet) and the two carbonyl carbons and two alkene carbons respectively equivalent.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic, conjugated diene, ideal for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **[4+2] cycloaddition**, also known as the **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   In this specific Diels-Alder reaction, the diene reacts across its C1 and C4 positions with the double bond of the maleic anhydride.\n    *   The product is a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative. Let's break down the resulting structure:\n        *   The original C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond in the bicyclic system. This double bond is substituted with two methyl groups.\n        *   The original C1 and C4 of the diene become saturated bridgehead carbons. Each of these bridgehead carbons is substituted with a methyl group.\n        *   The original C5 (the CH₂ group) of the diene becomes the one-carbon methylene bridge.\n        *   The maleic anhydride becomes a fused anhydride ring, adding two methine (CH) groups to the structure.\n    *   The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (the diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (the anhydride).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo Products):**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions typically produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The Alder Rule states that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically favored product. This is due to secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile during the transition state.\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C(Me)=C(Me) bridge and on the same side as the one-carbon methylene bridge. In this conformation, the two protons from the anhydride part (let's call them Hₓ) point *towards* the C(Me)=C(Me) double bond.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away from\" the C(Me)=C(Me) bridge. The Hₓ protons point *away* from the C(Me)=C(Me) double bond and towards the methyl-substituted bridgehead carbons.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Resonances:**\n    *   Let's assign the signals described in the options to the protons in our product structure.\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (Hₓ). They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, which explains their downfield shift. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Vinyl methyl groups typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm. These are the two methyl groups attached to the double bond. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the two methyl groups attached to the saturated bridgehead carbons. Being on an sp³ carbon and potentially shielded by the magnetic anisotropy of other parts of the molecule, a shift of ~1.0 ppm is reasonable. They are equivalent by symmetry.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This must be one of the two diastereotopic protons of the CH₂ bridge. It is coupled to the other CH₂ proton, hence it's a doublet.\n\n6.  **Predict the NOESY Cross-Peaks:**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We are looking for an interaction present in the major product but absent in the minor one.\n    *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The Hₓ protons (~3.5 ppm) point directly towards the C(Me)=C(Me) bridge. Therefore, they are spatially very close to the two vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two sets of protons.\n    *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The Hₓ protons (~3.5 ppm) point away from the C(Me)=C(Me) bridge and its methyl groups. The distance is too large for a significant NOE. Instead, in the exo isomer, the Hₓ protons would be close to the bridgehead methyl groups (~1.0 ppm).\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The NOE cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product is the one between the anhydride protons (Hₓ) and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
