    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where n is the number of fluorine atoms. The atomic weight of fluorine, Ar(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\nThe formula for mass fraction is:\nɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the atomic weight of Y, Ar(Y):\nAr(Y) = (n * Ar(F) / ɷF) - n * Ar(F)\nAr(Y) = n * Ar(F) * (1/ɷF - 1)\nAr(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\nAr(Y) = n * 19.00 * (3.1289 - 1)\nAr(Y) ≈ n * 40.45\n\nNow we test plausible integer values for n:\n*   n = 1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (matches Ca, K - chemically unlikely)\n*   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (matches Br, Se - chemically unlikely)\n*   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Sb, Antimony, Ar = 121.76 g/mol)\n*   n = 4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy, Dysprosium - chemically unlikely)\n*   n = 6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Pu, Plutonium, Ar ≈ 244 g/mol)\n\nThe best fits based on mass are Antimony (Sb) and Plutonium (Pu). However, the properties described (bright-red color, decomposition, reaction with xenon) suggest an extremely reactive substance. Let's consider a noble gas, Krypton (Kr), as Y.\n*   If Y = Kr (Ar = 83.8 g/mol), the most common fluoride is KrF2 (n=2). Let's calculate its ɷF:\n    ɷF(KrF2) = (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 2 * 19) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 0.312 or 31.2%.\nThis value (31.2%) is close to the given value of 31.96%. Although not a perfect match, it is plausible that there is a small error in the problem's data. Let's evaluate the chemical properties, which are often more revealing.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the chemical properties to confirm Y.**\n\nLet's assume Y = Krypton (Kr) and see if the properties match.\n\n*   **A1 is a bright-red substance:** Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4) has been reported as a bright-red solid in matrix isolation studies. This is a very specific and strong clue. Let's assume **A1 = KrF4**.\n*   **A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine:** KrF4 is known to be much less stable than KrF2 and can decompose, particularly upon warming. The reaction `KrF4 -> KrF2 + F2` fits the description perfectly. This implies **A2 = KrF2**.\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon:** KrF4 is an exceptionally strong oxidizing and fluorinating agent, much stronger than xenon fluorides, and would readily react with xenon. This fits.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y:** The direct reaction of Krypton with Fluorine produces Krypton difluoride. `Kr + F2 -> KrF2`. So, **A3 = KrF2**.\n*   **A3 can also interact with xenon:** KrF2 is a powerful enough oxidizer to react with xenon: `KrF2 + Xe -> Kr + XeF2`. This fits.\n*   **By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to ... A4, A5 can be obtained:** This describes a comproportionation reaction. We have `Kr + A4 -> A5`. A plausible reaction using the known krypton fluorides is: `Kr + KrF4 -> 2 KrF2`. This reaction has exactly a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Kr and KrF4). This is a remarkably good fit for the description.\n    *   This implies **A4 = KrF4** and **A5 = KrF2**.\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides a consistent explanation for all the chemical properties and reaction stoichiometries described, despite the slight discrepancy in the mass percentage. Other candidates like Antimony run into more significant contradictions (e.g., SbF5 is colorless and stable, and the comproportionation ratio is not 1:1).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nBased on our analysis, the substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF4).\nWe calculate its molecular weight (MW) using the atomic weights:\n*   Ar(Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol\n*   Ar(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n\nMW(KrF4) = Ar(Kr) + 4 * Ar(F)\nMW(KrF4) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0\nMW(KrF4) = 83.8 + 76.0\nMW(KrF4) = 159.8 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct range.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol. We need to find the range that includes this value.\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe value 159.8 g/mol falls within the range [140, 160]. If we interpret the range as inclusive of its endpoints, C is a good choice. However, 159.8 is extremely close to 160. Given standard rounding practices and the format of such questions, it's also highly likely to be considered as fitting in the range 160-180. Let's re-examine the precision.\nUsing more precise atomic weights: Ar(Kr) = 83.798 g/mol, Ar(F) = 18.9984 g/mol.\nMW(KrF4) = 83.798 + 4 * 18.9984 = 83.798 + 75.9936 = 159.7916 g/mol.\nThis value is still technically in the range [140, 160]. However, let's consider the possibility that A4 is SbF3. MW = 178.76 g/mol. This is perfectly in range B. But the chemistry doesn't work. Let's go back to SbF5. MW = 216.76. This is not in any range except A (220-240 is close).\n\nLet's revisit the Krypton hypothesis. A4=KrF4, MW=159.8. This value is on the boundary between C and B. Such ambiguity can sometimes occur in problems. However, the identification of Krypton chemistry is very robust. If we assume the question means from 160 up to 180, 159.8 is not included. If the range 140-160 is meant to be [140, 160], then 159.8 is clearly inside.\nLet's reconsider the Sb case. What if A4 is SbF3, MW=178.76. And the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5`... this makes no chemical sense as Sb cannot be oxidized by SbF3. A4 must be SbF5. MW = 216.76. None of the ranges fit well.\nThe Krypton identification is the most chemically sound. The MW is 159.8. Range C is 140-160. Range B is 160-180. It's borderline. In multiple choice questions, one should choose the *best* fit. Let's assume the ranges are inclusive. Then C is the correct answer. But let's look at B again. What could have a MW in 160-180? SbF3 has MW = 178.76. Could A4 be SbF3? No, because Y(Sb) cannot be oxidized by A4(SbF3). Therefore, A4 cannot be SbF3. This eliminates the only strong candidate for range B.\nThe most plausible identified compound is KrF4 (MW=159.8). This fits range C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
