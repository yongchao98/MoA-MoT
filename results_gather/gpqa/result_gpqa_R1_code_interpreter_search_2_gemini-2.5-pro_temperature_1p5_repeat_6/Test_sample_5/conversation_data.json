    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:** The given potential for the particle is in two-dimensional polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    $V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)$\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:** To solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential, it is often helpful to see if it simplifies in another coordinate system. Let's convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the standard transformations:\n    *   $x = r \\cos(θ)$\n    *   $y = r \\sin(θ)$\n    *   $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (r \\cos(θ))^2$\n    Since $x = r \\cos(θ)$, we have:\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2$\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential:** Now, group the terms with $x^2$ and $y^2$:\n    $V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (4/2 k) x^2 + 1/2 k y^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2$\n\n4.  **Identify the System:** This potential is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\n    where:\n    *   $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n    *   $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$\n\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction.\n\n5.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is separable. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions:\n    $E = E_x + E_y$\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form $V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2$ are given by:\n    $E_n = (n + 1/2) \\hbar ω$, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n6.  **Find the Angular Frequencies:** We need to find the angular frequencies $ω_x$ and $ω_y$ by comparing our potentials $V_x(x)$ and $V_y(y)$ with the general form $1/2 mω^2 q^2$.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        $V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2$\n        So, we have $1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = 1/2 (4k)x^2$.\n        $mω_x^2 = 4k \\implies ω_x^2 = 4k/m \\implies ω_x = \\sqrt{4k/m} = 2\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$\n        So, we have $1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2$.\n        $mω_y^2 = k \\implies ω_y^2 = k/m \\implies ω_y = \\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Energy Eigenvalues:** Now we can write down the energy for each oscillator:\n    *   $E_x = (n_x + 1/2) \\hbar ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{k/m})$\n    *   $E_y = (n_y + 1/2) \\hbar ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) \\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$\n    where $n_x$ and $n_y$ are non-negative integer quantum numbers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n8.  **Find the Total Energy Spectrum:** Sum the energies to get the total energy E:\n    $E = E_x + E_y$\n    $E = (n_x + 1/2) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{k/m}) + (n_y + 1/2) \\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$\n    Factor out the common term $\\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$:\n    $E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] \\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] \\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \\hbar \\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
