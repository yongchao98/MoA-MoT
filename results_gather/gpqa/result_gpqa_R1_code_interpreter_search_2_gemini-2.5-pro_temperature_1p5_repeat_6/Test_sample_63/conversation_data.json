We can determine the identity and quantity of these gases from the information given about the absorption tubes.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen gas (O₂) according to the reaction `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is approximately 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP did not react in any of the previous tubes. This suggests it is an inert gas, likely nitrogen (N₂), which is a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n2.  **Verify Mass Conservation**\n    Let's sum the masses of the products to see if they match the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g (given)\n    *   Mass of O₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.025 mol × 32 g/mol = 0.80 g\n    *   Mass of N₂ = Moles × Molar Mass = 0.10 mol × 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n    *   Total Mass of Products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our product identification and calculations.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n    The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) and the fact that the original substances were salts strongly suggest the decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The two most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n    Their decomposition reactions are:\n    *   (B) `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   (A) `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n\n    The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume there were `n` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₃) and `n` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₂). Let's calculate the total moles of each product:\n\n    *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: We get `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O (by dividing the balanced equation by 2).\n    *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: We get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n    Total moles of products from the mixture:\n    *   Total N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n    *   Total O₂ = `0.5n` (from A) + 0 = `0.5n`\n    *   Total H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n\n    Now we match this with our experimental moles:\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol ⇒ `0.5n = 0.025` ⇒ `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n    So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂. Let's verify this `n` value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `2n` = 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   Total H₂O = `4n` = 4 × 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\n\n4.  **Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n    The salts have been identified as A = NH₄NO₃ and B = NH₄NO₂. The question asks for the total number of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n        *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n        *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n        *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts A and B** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
