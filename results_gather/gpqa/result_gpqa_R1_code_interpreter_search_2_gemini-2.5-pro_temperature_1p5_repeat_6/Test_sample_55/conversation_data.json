    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through a two-step dipole transition. Electric dipole (E1) transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n    *   Change in principal quantum number: $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. The process is a cascade: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$):\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Since this is a decay process, the energy must decrease at each step. The energy in a hydrogen atom depends primarily on $n$. Therefore, $n' < 3$. For a two-step decay to $n=1$, the intermediate state must have a principal quantum number between 1 and 3, so $n'=2$.\n        *   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$, the corresponding $\\Delta m$ will be $+1, 0, -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta m=0, \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   Thus, all three paths through the intermediate states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are allowed by the selection rules. All the options listed (A, B, C, D) propose valid routes.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n    The probability of a particular cascade path is determined by the branching ratio of the first step. The second step, from any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$, is the only possible dipole decay from the $n=2, l=1$ level. Therefore, once the atom reaches the intermediate state, it will decay to the ground state with a probability of 1. The problem reduces to finding the probability of the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\n    The transition rate for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wave function $\\psi_{300}$ is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the magnetic sublevels ($m' = -1, 0, 1$) of the final $l'=1$ state.\n\n    To be more rigorous, the transition rate to a specific sublevel $|n'l'm'\\rangle$ is proportional to $|\\langle n'l'm'|x|nlm\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle n'l'm'|y|nlm\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle n'l'm'|z|nlm\\rangle|^2$. For a transition from an $l=0, m=0$ state to an $l'=1$ state, one can calculate these matrix elements and find that the sum is independent of the final $m'$:\n    *   Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$) is proportional to a value $C$.\n    *   Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) is proportional to the same value $C$.\n    *   Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) is proportional to the same value $C$.\n\n    Since there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the total decay rate for the $3s \\to 2p$ transition is proportional to $3C$. The probability, or branching ratio, for the atom to take any specific one of these channels is:\n    $P(\\text{channel}) = \\frac{\\text{Rate for that channel}}{\\text{Total rate}} = \\frac{C}{C+C+C} = \\frac{C}{3C} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    So, the probability for each of the three possible cascade paths is $1/3$:\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3 \\times 1 = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3 \\times 1 = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = 1/3 \\times 1 = 1/3$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    Now we compare our result with the options provided:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
