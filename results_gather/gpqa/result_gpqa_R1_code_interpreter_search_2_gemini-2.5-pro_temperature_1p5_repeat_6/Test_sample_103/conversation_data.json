    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to detect exoplanets. This method works by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of a star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be periodically red-shifted and blue-shifted from our perspective. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The observable is the periodic wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$. The maximum shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    *   From the Doppler shift formula, $\\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_{rad} / c$, we can see that $\\Delta \\lambda_{max} \\propto K$.\n    *   We are given $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ milliangstroms and $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ milliangstroms.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is $K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$.\n\n3.  **Find the Formula Connecting RV Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T):**\n    *   The amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$, for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n        $K = v_s \\sin(i)$\n        where $v_s$ is the speed of the star around the system's center of mass and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   This can be expressed in terms of the orbital period ($T$), the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_s$), and the gravitational constant ($G$):\n        $K = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    *   This formula shows the relationship between the RV amplitude and the orbital period: $K$ is proportional to $T^{-1/3}$, assuming all other parameters (masses, inclination) are constant.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to the Two Systems:**\n    *   The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$) and the planets have the same mass ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable, we must assume that the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a reasonable assumption in this context, as the question asks for a single numerical answer.\n    *   Since all other parameters ($M_s, M_p, i$) are the same for both systems, the relationship simplifies to:\n        $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio and Solve:**\n    *   We can write the ratio of the RV amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the periods:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(T_2)^{-1/3}}{(T_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   We already found that $K_2 / K_1 = 1.4$. So:\n        $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   The question asks for the ratio of the periods, $T_2 / T_1$. To solve for this, we need to raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n        $\\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right) = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{(1.4)^3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Now, we compute the value of the expression.\n    *   $(1.4)^3 = 1.4 \\times 1.4 \\times 1.4 = 1.96 \\times 1.4 = 2.744$.\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n    *   Let's use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n\n```python\nratio = (1.4)**(-3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644324208226922\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio $T_2 / T_1$ is approximately 0.3644.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value ~0.364 is closest to option D.\n\nThe period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. The question asks \"How many times ... longer\", which simply asks for the multiplicative factor, which can be less than one. The factor is ~0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable to the Physical Quantity:**\n    The problem provides the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) of a spectral line for two stars. This is the core observable in the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The magnitude of this shift is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (its radial velocity). The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the RV amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n    So, we have the relationship:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n    Given the values:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    We can find the ratio of the RV amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Find the Relevant Physical Formula:**\n    The RV amplitude ($K$) for a star with a single planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{T} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $T$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_s$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Parameters for Both Systems:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have the same mass: $M_{p1} = M_{p2}$.\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n    *   For the problem to have a unique solution, we must assume that the orbital inclinations are the same for both systems ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a standard simplifying assumption in such problems.\n\n    With all other factors being the same for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between the RV amplitude ($K$) and the orbital period ($T$):\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio and Solve for the Period Ratio:**\n    We can now write the ratio of the RV amplitudes in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$. Substituting this value:\n    $1.4 = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    The question asks for the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. To solve for it, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n    $\\left( ( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} )^{-1/3} \\right)^{-3} = (1.4)^{-3}$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now, we compute the numerical value for the ratio.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.\n# The ratio of the RV amplitudes K2/K1 is 1.4.\n# The relationship is K is proportional to T^(-1/3).\n# So, K2/K1 = (T2/T1)^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, T2/T1 = (K2/K1)^(-3) = 1.4^(-3).\nratio = 1.4 ** (-3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644324208226922\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This value matches option D.\n\nA quick sanity check confirms the result: a larger RV amplitude (system #2) must be caused by a shorter orbital period, so the ratio $T_2/T_1$ must be less than 1. Our answer of ~0.36 is consistent with this.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The key idea is that a planet's gravitational pull makes its host star \"wobble\". This wobble causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's light.\n*   A larger wobble (higher radial velocity) leads to a larger wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$).\n*   The maximum radial velocity of the star is called the RV amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n*   Therefore, the observed wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV amplitude: $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ratio of RV Amplitudes**\n\nWe are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Planet #1: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   Planet #2: $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K$) is the same as the ratio of these shifts:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\nThis tells us that Star #2 is wobbling 1.4 times faster than Star #1.\n\n**3. Relate RV Amplitude to Orbital Period**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($T$) by the following relationship:\n$K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{T}}$ or $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\nThis relationship holds true because all other factors in the full physics equation (masses of the stars, masses of the planets, and orbital inclination) are stated or assumed to be identical for both systems.\n\nIntuitively, for a planet of the same mass, a shorter period (closer orbit) means the planet moves faster, exerting a stronger gravitational tug over a shorter time, forcing the star to wobble more quickly and with a larger velocity amplitude.\n\n**4. Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n\nWe can now use the ratios from the previous steps:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3}$\n\nSubstitute the value we found for the ratio of the RV amplitudes:\n$1.4 = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^{-1/3}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, we need to solve for it. We can do this by raising both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we compute the value:\n```python\n# The ratio of the periods T2/T1 is equal to the ratio of the \n# RV amplitudes (K2/K1) raised to the power of -3.\n# K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4\nperiod_ratio = 1.4 ** -3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644324208226922\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.364. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The analysis and the Python calculation are correct. Let's summarize the steps one last time to confirm the result.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n\n1.  **Ratio of Radial Velocities (RV Amplitudes):** The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's RV amplitude ($K$).\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relationship between RV Amplitude and Orbital Period:** For a given star and planet mass, the RV amplitude ($K$) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period ($T$).\n    *   $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** We combine the two relationships.\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   Substitute the known value: $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   To find the period ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, raise both sides to the power of -3:\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (1.4)^{-3}$\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The provided code output correctly calculates this value:\n    *   $(1.4)^{-3} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
