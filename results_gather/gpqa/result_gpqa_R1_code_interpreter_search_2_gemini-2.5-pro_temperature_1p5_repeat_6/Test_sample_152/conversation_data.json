    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a base (NaOEt), the acidic α-hydrogen between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon is electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks the β-carbon (`CH-p-Tolyl`).\n    2.  **Bond Formation:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. This pushes the electrons from the C=C double bond to form an enolate intermediate.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n*   **Product Structure (A):** The resulting structure is `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming Product A:** To name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups. We can consider it as a propane derivative.\n    *   Let the propane chain be C1-C2-C3.\n    *   ` (CH₃OOC)₂CH(1) - CH(p-tolyl)(2) - CH₂(3)COOCH₃ `\n    *   There are two methyl carboxylate groups on C1, a p-tolyl group on C2, and a methyl carboxylate group on C3.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   This is a Stork enamine reaction, a variation of the Michael addition.\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the enamine, which corresponds to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile, forming a new C-C bond. This results in an iminium salt intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The piperidine amine is removed, and a carbonyl group (C=O) is restored on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Product Structure (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-carbon (C2) with the group derived from the acceptor. The acceptor `CH₃-CH=CH-CN` becomes ` -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So the product is a C2-substituted cyclohexanone.\n*   **Naming Product B:** The main chain is the nitrile.\n    *   Butanenitrile chain: `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH₃(4)`\n    *   At position 3, there is a substituent: a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   The name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is typically not the major product isolated after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a retrosynthesis problem where the product and one reactant are given, and we need to identify the other reactant (C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Analysis:** The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The product has a cyclohexane-1,3-dione core.\n    *   The substituent at the C2 position is a `-(CH₂)CH₂COCH₃` group. This is the `(3-oxobutyl)` group.\n    *   This substituent is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK, after it has been attacked at its β-carbon (`CH₂`) and then protonated.\n    *   Therefore, the C-C bond formed during the reaction is between the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the terminal `CH₂` group of the incoming MVK.\n*   **Reactant C (Michael Donor):** The nucleophile must have been the enolate of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C-H at C2 (between the two carbonyl groups).\n    *   Thus, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The other option, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, is not the correct starting material. Cyclohexane-1,3-dione exists in equilibrium with its enol form (3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one), but the dione itself is the compound used.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that option B matches all three conclusions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
