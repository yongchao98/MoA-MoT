    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators suppressed by a large energy scale, Λ. These operators are constructed using the SM fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, relating observations made in different inertial frames. Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), including the Standard Model and its effective extensions like SMEFT, are built upon the principle of Lorentz invariance. All terms in the Lagrangian, including the new SMEFT operators, must be Lorentz scalars to ensure the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, encompassing Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational pillar of QFT. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. SMEFT is constructed as a local QFT on Minkowski spacetime and is therefore invariant under the Poincaré group.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P) symmetry. It is well-established that CP symmetry is violated in nature. The Standard Model itself contains a source of CP violation in the weak sector, through the complex phase of the CKM matrix. One of the main goals of SMEFT is to parameterize potential new physics beyond the Standard Model, which may include new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are explicitly allowed to violate CP symmetry, and there is no requirement for them to respect it.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time-reversal (T) symmetry. The **CPT Theorem** is a fundamental result in local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. It states that any such theory is automatically symmetric under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is formulated as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must necessarily respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a breakdown of Lorentz invariance or locality, which are foundational assumptions of SMEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Lorentz symmetry (1) **must** be respected.\n*   Poincaré symmetry (2) **must** be respected.\n*   CP symmetry (3) **is not** required to be respected.\n*   CPT symmetry (4) **must** be respected.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nThis corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
