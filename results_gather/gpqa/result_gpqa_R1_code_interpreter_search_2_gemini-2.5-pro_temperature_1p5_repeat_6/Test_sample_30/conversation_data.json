    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) and a nitrating mixture (HNO₃ + H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The electrophile is the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director and an activating group. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will be directed to the positions ortho (2 and 6) and para (4) relative to the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** A mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene is formed. Due to less steric hindrance, the para-isomer (4-nitrotoluene) is the major product. In a multi-step synthesis problem, it is standard to assume the major product is carried to the next step.\n    *   **Product 1: 4-nitrotoluene**\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination acts as an oxidizing agent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The methyl group is at a benzylic position, which makes it susceptible to oxidation. While MnO₂ is considered a mild oxidizing agent, often used for oxidizing benzylic alcohols, it can oxidize benzylic methyl groups to aldehydes, especially in the context of a problem where the subsequent step requires an aldehyde. The nitro group (-NO₂) is deactivating, making the oxidation harder than for toluene itself, but it is the most plausible reaction. Oxidation all the way to a carboxylic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid) is less likely to be the intended intermediate because it would not react with acetone in the next step in a way that leads to a complex product.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   **Product 2: 4-nitrobenzaldehyde**\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O).\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate nucleophile (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`). 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, which has no α-protons, acts as the electrophile. The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product then readily undergoes dehydration (loss of H₂O) because the resulting double bond is conjugated with both the aromatic ring and the ketone's carbonyl group, which is a very stable arrangement.\n*   **Product 3:** The condensation product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The E (trans) isomer is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure of Product 3:**\n    `O₂N - (C₆H₄) - CH=CH - C(=O) - CH₃`\n    The structure consists of a 4-nitrophenyl group attached to a but-3-en-2-one chain.\n\n*   **Conformation:** Due to the extensive π-system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond), the heavy-atom backbone of the molecule is largely planar to maximize conjugation and stability.\n\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules possess the identity element.\n    2.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Since the heavy-atom framework and the hydrogens on the ring and double bond are planar, this molecular plane can act as a plane of symmetry. Let's consider the methyl (-CH₃) group. The carbon atom of the methyl group lies in this plane. The three hydrogen atoms can orient themselves such that one hydrogen also lies in the plane, while the other two are positioned symmetrically above and below the plane. In this low-energy conformation, the molecular plane acts as a reflection plane for the entire molecule. Reflection through this plane maps every atom in the plane onto itself and exchanges the two out-of-plane hydrogen atoms of the methyl group. Therefore, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (σ).\n    3.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion. Inverting through the center of the molecule would not map the structure onto itself (e.g., the NO₂ group is on one end and the acetyl group, -COCH₃, is on the other).\n    4.  **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** The molecule has no rotational symmetry. A C₂ axis, for instance, is not present because the two ends of the molecule are different.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The only symmetry elements present in the molecule are the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule that possesses only these two symmetry elements belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA) C₂h (contains C₂, i, σh) - Incorrect.\nB) C₃ (contains C₃) - Incorrect.\nC) D₂h (contains multiple C₂, i, multiple σ) - Incorrect.\nD) Cₛ (contains E, σ) - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
