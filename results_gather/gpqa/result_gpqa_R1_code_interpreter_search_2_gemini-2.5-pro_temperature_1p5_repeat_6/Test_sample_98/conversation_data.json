    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum. We need to find a structure that has protons exhibiting both of these specific patterns. The n+1 rule is used to determine the multiplicity, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet.\n        *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **t**riplet.\n        *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **q**uartet.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet.\n        *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **t**riplet.\n        *   Another set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another **t**riplet.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Proposed Structure**\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula and then analyze the expected splitting patterns for the methine (C-H) protons.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the methyl group at C3 (3H, quartet), and the CH2 group at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtq**. This matches one signal.\n    *   **H at C2**: Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the methyl group at C2 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq**.\n    *   This structure has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `(CH3)2(Me's@4)-CH(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to the CH2 group at C2 (2H, triplet), H at C4 (1H, doublet), and the methyl group at C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **tdq**. This does not match `dtq`.\n    *   **H at C4**: Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the two methyl groups at C4 (6H, septet). This gives a **ds**.\n    *   This structure has neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **H at C3**: Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH2 group of the ethyl at C3 (2H, triplet), and the CH2 group at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This matches one signal.\n    *   **H at C2**: Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH2 group of the ethyl at C2 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt**.\n    *   This structure has a `dtt` but does not have a `dtq`. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    The formula is interpreted as `(CH3CH(C2H5))-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`, which is `sec-butyl` attached to `CH(Et)CH2COOH`. The IUPAC name is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.\n    `CH3(6)-CH2(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Et)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n    Let's analyze the two unique methine protons, H at C3 and H at C4.\n    *   **H at C4**: This proton is coupled to:\n        *   H at C3 (1 neighbor) → **d**oublet\n        *   CH₂ group at C5 (2 neighbors) → **t**riplet\n        *   Methyl group at C4 (3 neighbors) → **q**uartet\n        This combination gives a **dtq**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n    *   **H at C3**: This proton is coupled to:\n        *   H at C4 (1 neighbor) → **d**oublet\n        *   CH₂ group at C2 (2 neighbors) → **t**riplet\n        *   CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2 neighbors) → **t**riplet\n        This combination gives a **dtt** (or tdt, which is the same pattern). This perfectly matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStructure D, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound that contains a proton with a `dtq` splitting pattern (H at C4) and another proton with a `dtt` splitting pattern (H at C3). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
