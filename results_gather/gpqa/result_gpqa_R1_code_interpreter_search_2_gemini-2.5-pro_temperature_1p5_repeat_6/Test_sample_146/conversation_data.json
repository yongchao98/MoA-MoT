    "This problem involves a particle annihilation process governed by the principle of conservation of energy. We need to find the velocity of the resulting particles.\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\nIn this particle interaction, the total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. In relativistic physics, the total energy (E) of a particle is the sum of its rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$) and its kinetic energy (K). The total energy can also be expressed using the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, as $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\nThe initial state consists of a proton (p) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate it as being at rest.\n*   For the proton, we assume it is also at rest (e.g., in a fixed-target experiment), which is a common scenario for this type of problem statement.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   Protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass. The rest energy of a proton is $m_pc^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_pc^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 = 2 \\times m_pc^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   All four particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   The rest energy of particle A is given as $m_Ac^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   After the annihilation, the initial rest energy is converted into the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the four final particles.\n*   By symmetry (starting from a net momentum of zero), the total energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Each particle A will have the same total energy, $E_A$, and the same speed, v.\n*   The total energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor corresponding to its velocity.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n**4. Solving for Velocity**\nEquating the initial and final energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$2 \\times m_pc^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\nNow, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 \\times m_pc^2}{4 \\times m_Ac^2} = \\frac{m_pc^2}{2 \\times m_Ac^2}$\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity (v) by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can solve this for $v/c$ (often denoted as $\\beta$):\n$\\beta = \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nUsing our calculated value for $\\gamma_A$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nTo perform the calculation with higher precision, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants from the problem\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300     # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A\n# From conservation of energy: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma_A * m_A_c2\ngamma_A = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c) from the Lorentz factor\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)  =>  beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta_A = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A**2)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A as a fraction of c is: {beta_A:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe calculation yields a velocity of approximately 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
