    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Decay:**\n    The first decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`.\n    *   This is a multi-particle final state (two E particles, two V particles, and the two B nucleons).\n    *   The total energy released by the nuclear transition, let's call it `Q_value`, is determined by the mass difference: `Q_value = m(2A)c^2 - m(2B)c^2`.\n    *   This energy is shared among the final particles. For the light particles, `Q_value â‰ˆ E_total(2E) + E_total(2V)`, where `E_total` is the sum of the total energies of the respective particles.\n    *   The problem states the spectrum of the total energy of the two E particles, `E_total(2E)`, is continuous. This is expected, as the two V particles can carry away a variable amount of energy.\n    *   The endpoint of this spectrum, which the problem calls `Q`, is the maximum possible value for `E_total(2E)`. This maximum occurs when the other light particles (the two V's) carry away the minimum possible energy.\n    *   The particle V is described as \"much lighter\". This suggests it has a small but non-zero mass, `m_V > 0`. A real-world analogue is a neutrino. The minimum total energy for two such particles is their combined rest mass energy: `E_total(2V)_min = 2 * m_V * c^2`.\n    *   Therefore, the endpoint `Q` is given by `Q = Q_value - E_total(2V)_min = Q_value - 2m_V c^2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Variant Decay:**\n    The second decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`.\n    *   In this decay, the two V particles are replaced by a single particle M, which is explicitly stated to be **massless** (`m_M = 0`).\n    *   The final state still has multiple particles (`2E + M`), so the available energy `Q_value` will be shared among them.\n    *   Since the energy can be distributed in a continuous range of ways between the two E particles and the M particle, the total energy spectrum of the E particles, `E_total(2E)`, will remain **continuous**. This eliminates options A and D, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n    *   The fact that there are a different number of particles in the final state (3 light particles instead of 4) means the phase space is different, so the *shape* of the spectrum will be adjusted.\n\n3.  **Compare the Endpoints:**\n    *   We need to find the endpoint of the new spectrum, let's call it `Q'`.\n    *   `Q'` is the maximum value of `E_total(2E)` in the second decay. This occurs when the M particle carries away its minimum possible energy.\n    *   Since M is a single, massless particle, its minimum energy is zero: `E(M)_min = 0`.\n    *   The nuclear energy release is the same: `Q_value = m(2A)c^2 - m(2B)c^2`.\n    *   So, the new endpoint is `Q' = Q_value - E(M)_min = Q_value - 0 = Q_value`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The original endpoint was `Q = Q_value - 2m_V c^2`.\n    *   The new endpoint is `Q' = Q_value`.\n    *   Comparing the two: `Q' = Q + 2m_V c^2`.\n    *   Since V has a non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`), the term `2m_V c^2` is positive. Therefore, `Q' > Q`. The endpoint of the spectrum **increases**.\n\nCombining our findings: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
