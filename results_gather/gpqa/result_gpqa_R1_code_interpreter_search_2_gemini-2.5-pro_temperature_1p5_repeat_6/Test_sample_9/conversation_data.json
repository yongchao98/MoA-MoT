    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Concept of Density in Planets:**\n    *   Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V): ρ = M / V.\n    *   For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n    *   A key factor influencing a planet's density is its composition (e.g., rock, iron, gas).\n    *   Another crucial factor is gravitational compression. For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the planet's material more tightly, resulting in a smaller radius than would be expected otherwise and, therefore, a higher overall density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a description of Earth itself. We can use Earth's average density as a baseline.\n        *   Density of Earth (ρ_a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** This option explicitly gives the density.\n        *   Density (ρ_b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³.\n        *   This density is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:**\n        *   This planet has the same fundamental \"ingredients\" as Earth (iron core, silicate mantle).\n        *   However, it is significantly more massive (M_c = 5 M_earth).\n        *   Due to the principle of gravitational compression, the immense gravity of this 5-Earth-mass planet will squeeze its material much more than in Earth.\n        *   This compression leads to a higher density. Therefore, the density of this planet (ρ_c) will be greater than Earth's density.\n        *   Based on planetary structure models, its density would be roughly in the range of 7-8 g/cm³.\n        *   So, ρ_c > ρ_a.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:**\n        *   This planet has the same composition as Earth but is less massive (M_d = 0.5 M_earth).\n        *   Its gravity will be weaker, and thus the effect of gravitational compression will be less pronounced than in Earth.\n        *   As a result, its material will be less compressed, leading to a lower overall density.\n        *   Therefore, the density of this planet (ρ_d) will be less than Earth's density.\n        *   Its density would be slightly less than 5 g/cm³.\n        *   So, ρ_d < ρ_a.\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³ (significantly higher)\n    *   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n    By comparing these values, it is clear that planet (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
