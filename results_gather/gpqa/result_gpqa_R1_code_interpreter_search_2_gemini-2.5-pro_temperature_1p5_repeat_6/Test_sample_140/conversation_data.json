    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (d or D), an isotope of hydrogen, at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The reaction begins with the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with deuterium (D).\n    *   C6 is substituted with hydrogen (H).\n    *   Because both positions have a \"proton-like\" species, two different elimination pathways are possible.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C6, which then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule.\n        *   This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. This pathway is generally faster due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are broken more easily than C-D bonds).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        *   This forms a carbanion at C2, which expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule in this step.\n        *   This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   Since both pathways are possible (even if one is slower), we form a mixture of two different benzyne intermediates: 3-deuterobenzyne and benzyne.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), then attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃).\n\n    *   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the D at C2. This is **3-deuterioaniline** (the D is in the meta position relative to the amino group).\n        *   Therefore, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate yields **two** distinct products.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Attack on benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   This intermediate has no deuterium. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n        *   Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline**.\n        *   Therefore, the benzyne intermediate yields **one** product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Products**\n    *   Combining the products from both possible pathways, we have:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline\n        3.  Aniline\n    *   In total, there are **three** possible unique organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
