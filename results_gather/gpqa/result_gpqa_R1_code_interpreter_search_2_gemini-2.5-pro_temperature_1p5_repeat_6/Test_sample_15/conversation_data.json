    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess the chirality of each molecule. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture. Chiral molecules are non-superimposable on their mirror images. This property usually arises from the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or other elements of chirality, and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or centers of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is centered around a C=C double bond. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which indicates the presence of specific stereoisomers at chiral centers.\n    *   Naming a compound as a single, specific enantiomer (or diastereomer that is chiral) implies that it is not a racemic mixture.\n    *   This is a complex, bridged bicyclic molecule. Such complex structures are very unlikely to possess the high degree of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry) that would render them achiral (i.e., make them a meso compound).\n    *   Since a specific chiral isomer is named, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (`H, CH3, COOH, -CH(CH3)COOH`) are identical to those on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as `(2R,3S)`. For a molecule with two identical chiral centers, the `R,S` (or `S,R`) diastereomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This can be visualized using a Fischer projection, where the top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   Molecules with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry are called meso compounds. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The configurations at the two chiral centers are `(2R,3R)`. This molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are non-superimposable. They form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, the `-CH=CH-` side of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-` side of the ring.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration for this chiral center, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. There are only two possible stereoisomers: one where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis), and one where one is on the opposite side to the other two (cis,trans).\n    *   The all-cis isomer is highly symmetric and has a three-fold axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry. It is achiral.\n    *   The cis,trans isomer has a single plane of symmetry. It is also achiral.\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of this compound are achiral (meso), it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is also known as cyclopentyl isobutyl ketone.\n    *   We must check for any chiral centers (sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n    *   Let's check the carbons: the cyclopentyl ring has no chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp2. The -CH2- carbon is not chiral. The -CH(CH3)2 carbon is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the chain, so it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Although individual conformations might be chiral, the molecule is flexible with free rotation around single bonds. This rapid rotation leads to conformational averaging, and the molecule is considered achiral on the whole. It does not have resolvable enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (meso)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we have 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
