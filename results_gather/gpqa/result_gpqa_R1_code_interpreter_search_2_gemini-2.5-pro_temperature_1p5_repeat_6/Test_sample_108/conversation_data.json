    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which reaction is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol is given by `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe need to check each potential reaction against the fundamental laws of conservation and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = J_final_system`\n    *   The initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final system consists of the NN pair (with angular momentum `J_f`) and particle X (with orbital angular momentum `l_X`). We assume the intrinsic spin of X is zero or is not coupled.\n    *   The conservation law in vector form is `J_i = J_f + l_X`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, this implies `J_f = -l_X`. The magnitudes must be equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final_system`\n    *   `P_i = P(NN_final) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(orbital_motion)`\n    *   We know `P_i = +1`, `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`, `P(X_intrinsic) = -1` (given), and `P(orbital_motion) = (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    *   This equation holds only if the exponent `(L_f + l_X + 1)` is an even number.\n    *   This means **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **(Implicit) Validity of Nucleon States:** A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with `S > 1` is not a valid two-nucleon state.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each of the proposed reactions against these four rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN State `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X: `f`-wave means `l_X=3`.\n*   Validity: `S_f=1` is valid.\n*   J-Conservation: `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. Rule `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   Parity Conservation: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*   Pauli Principle: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN State `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave means `l_X=1`.\n*   **Validity:** `S_f=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system. This reaction is forbidden because the final state is impossible.\n*   J-Conservation: `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. Rule `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   Parity Conservation: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*   Pauli Principle: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted (invalid final state).\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN State `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X: `s`-wave means `l_X=0`.\n*   Validity: `S_f=1` is valid.\n*   J-Conservation: `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. Rule `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   Parity Conservation: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*   **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` state.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not permitted (violates Pauli principle).\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN State `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave means `l_X=1`.\n*   Validity: `S_f=1` is valid.\n*   J-Conservation: `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. Rule `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.\n*   Parity Conservation: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*   Pauli Principle: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). Rule is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nBoth reactions B and C are forbidden.\n*   Reaction B is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Reaction C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle, a selection rule that was explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\nIn physics problems of this nature, you are expected to apply all relevant physical laws. However, when a specific rule is provided in the problem description, a violation of that rule is often the intended answer. Reaction C is the only one that violates the explicitly given Pauli principle condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f=0`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
