    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure and expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound**\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each compound to predict its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, and C5 is unique. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent, and C2/C3 are equivalent. This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The spectrum will show coupling. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet and the -CH3 protons will be a triplet. The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the spectra of the remaining possible mixtures**\n\nWe have a 1:1 mixture of two compounds. We need to superimpose the spectra of the individual compounds in the options to see if they match the given data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (each 6H).\n        *   In total, this gives **three singlets** (assuming they are all at different shifts). The integration ratio would be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   This combination is a perfect fit.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (each 1H).\n        *   The mixture would show a total of **three singlets** in the aromatic region with a 2:1:1 ratio (unless there's accidental overlap, which is less likely). This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (each 1H).\n        *   The mixture would show a total of **three singlets** in the aromatic region. This does not match the \"two singlets\" data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n        *   The mixture would show a total of **four singlets** in the alkyl region. This does not match the \"three singlets\" data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n<<<B>>>"
