    "**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an α-hydrogen (an alpha-hydrogen), which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered carbon ring with ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the α-carbons.\n    *   **α-hydrogens:** Each of these α-carbons (C2, C4, C6) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can and does exhibit tautomerism. It tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (benzene-1,3,5-triol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound. Thus, this compound *shows* tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups in a 'para' (1,4) arrangement.\n    *   **α-hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the two carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. These carbons are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone is the compound that **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **So, A = benzoquinone.**\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. Chirality in organic molecules most often arises from the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups. Such a molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n2.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methyl ester group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups attached to C2 are different, C2 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **shows** optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry as well as a plane of symmetry. It does not have any chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to its symmetry, dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and is not optically active. Therefore, it **does not** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **So, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nCombining the findings from both parts:\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
