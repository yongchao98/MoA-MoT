    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates as a blackbody. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\n    We need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that the star's properties ($T_{star}$, $R_{star}$) are the same for both planets and that they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n3.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity:**\n    The problem provides information about the Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), which is used to determine the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K$). The relationship is $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$.\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, and assuming the inclination angle $i \\approx 90°$ (which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet), the radial velocity amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} v_p$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, and $v_p$ is the planet's orbital velocity. The orbital velocity is $v_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$.\n    Substituting $v_p$ into the equation for $K$:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{star} a}}$\n    We can solve this for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    Using the formula for $a$, we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Substitute the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes into the Temperature Ratio Equation:**\n    From Step 2, we know $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$. Substituting the expression for $a_2/a_1$ from Step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2}$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratios of Masses and Radial Velocities:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n        $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **Radial Velocity Ratio:**\n        The radial velocity amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n        $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda \\implies \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03 \\text{ Å}$\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04 \\text{ Å}$\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, substitute the calculated ratios back into the equation from Step 5:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right) \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the numerical value, we perform the division.\n```python\n# Values for the ratios\nmass_ratio_p2_p1 = 5 / 7\nK_ratio_1_2 = 3 / 4\n\n# Calculate the final equilibrium temperature ratio\nT_eq_ratio_1_2 = mass_ratio_p2_p1 * K_ratio_1_2\n\nprint(f\"{T_eq_ratio_1_2:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>0.54\n\nThe result of the division is approximately 0.5357. Rounding to two decimal places gives 0.54, which is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both) and that they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). We can cancel these terms from the equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThis shows the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances (semi-major axes).\n\n**3. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of the star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \\left( \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nSince the orbits are circular, the eccentricity $e=0$. Because the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbital planes are aligned with our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$K = M_p \\left( \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = M_p^2 \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n\nThe gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $a_2 / a_1$ back into our temperature ratio equation from Step 2:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)$\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\n**6. Plug in the Given Values**\n\n*   Mass of Planet1 ($M_{p1}$) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet2 ($M_{p2}$) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, calculate the ratios:\n\n*   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   RV amplitude ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFinally, calculate the temperature ratio:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.54. This is closest to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
