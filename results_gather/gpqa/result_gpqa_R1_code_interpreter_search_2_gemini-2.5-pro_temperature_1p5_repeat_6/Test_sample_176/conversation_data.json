    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principle:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star that radiates as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $R$ is the star's radius, $T$ is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars and taking their ratio, the constants ($4\\pi\\sigma$) cancel out:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information about Radii:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Therefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n    $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n    Substituting this into our equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   The temperature of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max}$) by Wien's Displacement Law: $T = b / \\lambda_{max}$, where $b$ is Wien's constant. This law applies to the radiation *emitted* by the star.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}) / (b / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2}) = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$). We must account for the Doppler effect, which relates the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emitted} (1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1, $v_{r,1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{max, emitted, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{max, emitted, 2} / \\lambda_{max, emitted, 1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   This gives us the temperature ratio:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\times [1 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)]^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_{r,2}/c)^4$\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** Now, plug in the values for $v_{r,2}$ and $c$ to get the final answer. We'll use a Python script for precision.\n    *   $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) â‰ˆ 299,792,458 m/s\n    *   The mass information ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5  # Ratio of the radii\nvr2_kms = 700     # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\n\n# Convert units to SI\nvr2_ms = vr2_kms * 1000  # Radial velocity in m/s\nc_ms = 299792458         # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the squared ratio of the radii\nR_ratio_sq = R1_over_R2**2\n\n# Calculate the Doppler factor z = v/c\nz = vr2_ms / c_ms\n\n# The ratio of temperatures T1/T2 is 1 / (1 + z) because the observed peak wavelengths are the same\n# We need this ratio to the fourth power for the luminosity calculation\nT_ratio_fourth = (1 / (1 + z))**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio L1/L2\nL_ratio = R_ratio_sq * T_ratio_fourth\n\nprint(L_ratio)\n```\n\n<execute_result>\n2.2292359207005435\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user has provided the output from the previous code execution. The calculated value is ~2.229. I will now analyze this result to determine the final answer from the given options.\n\n**Analysis of the Result:**\n\n1.  **Recap of the Physics:** The luminosity ratio is given by the formula derived in the initial reasoning:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\times (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n2.  **Radius Term:** We were given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n\n3.  **Temperature Term:** We determined that the temperature ratio is affected by the Doppler shift of Star_2. Due to the motion of Star_2 away from the observer, its light is redshifted. For the observed peak wavelength to be the same as Star_1's, Star_2's actual emitted peak wavelength must be shorter, meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter than Star_1. The relationship was found to be:\n    $(T_1/T_2)^4 = [1 / (1 + v_2/c)]^4$\n\n4.  **Final Formula:**\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_2/c)^4$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:** The code executed this calculation:\n    *   $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c = 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$ (a precise value for the speed of light)\n    *   The Python script calculated:\n        $L_1/L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700000/299792458)^4 \\approx 2.2292$\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is ~2.2292.\n    *   The provided options are:\n        A) ~2.23\n        B) ~2.25\n        C) ~2.35\n        D) ~2.32\n    *   Rounding the calculated value to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately 2.23. This corresponds to option A. The mass information was extraneous data not needed for the calculation. The radial velocity, while seemingly small compared to the speed of light, has a noticeable effect on the calculated luminosity when raised to the fourth power.\n\n<<<A>>>"
