    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is conserved. The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy. The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$. The potential energy $U(x)$ for a spring system obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    The conserved total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Energy at Key Points of Oscillation:**\n    We need to consider two key points in the oscillator's motion:\n    *   **At maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass momentarily comes to a stop before changing direction. At this point, its speed is zero ($v=0$). When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$. The total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the maximum potential energy.\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The mass is moving at its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$. At this point, the potential energy is zero ($U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$). The total energy is entirely the relativistic energy of the mass moving at $v_{max}$. Let's denote the Lorentz factor at this speed as $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n3.  **Apply Energy Conservation:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    Our goal is to solve the above equation for $v_{max}$. First, let's solve for $\\gamma_{max}$. Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n    Now substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform a series of algebraic steps:\n    *   Invert both sides of the equation:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides to remove the square root:\n        $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ - Incorrect signs and structure.\n    *   B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ - This is the non-relativistic (classical) limit, obtained by equating $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ - Matches our derivation.\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ - Incorrect signs and missing a $c^2$ term.\n\n<<<C>>>"
