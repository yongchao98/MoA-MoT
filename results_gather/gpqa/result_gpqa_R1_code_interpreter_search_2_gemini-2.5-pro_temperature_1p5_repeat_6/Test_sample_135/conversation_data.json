    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field:**\n    The problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) provides a powerful way to solve this problem. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume `V`.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n    Here, `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and `S` is its surface. This theorem allows us to convert a triple integral (over the volume) into a double integral (over the surface), which is often simpler to compute.\n\n    **Note on the singularity:** The field `f(r)` is singular at the origin (`r=0`), where its magnitude becomes infinite. The Divergence Theorem technically requires the vector field to be well-behaved (continuously differentiable) everywhere inside the volume. However, the theorem can still be applied by considering the surface integral, which is well-defined. The physical interpretation is that there is a source (a \"point charge\") at the origin, and the divergence is a Dirac delta function there, `∇ ⋅ f = 4πδ³(r)`. Integrating this over the volume containing the origin correctly gives `4π`. The surface integral method elegantly handles this singularity.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   The vector field `f` on the surface of the sphere (where `r = R`) is:\n        `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` on a sphere is a vector pointing in the outward normal direction. For a sphere centered at the origin, this direction is the radial direction `r̂`. The magnitude of the area element is `R² sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So,\n        `dS = (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n    *   Now, we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n        The `R²` terms cancel out. The dot product of the unit vector with itself is `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R²) * R² * (r̂ ⋅ r̂) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   Finally, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The spherical coordinate `θ` (polar angle) goes from `0` to `π`, and `φ` (azimuthal angle) goes from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫[φ=0 to 2π] ∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `= (∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ) * (∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ)`\n\n    Let's evaluate each integral:\n    *   `∫[φ=0 to 2π] dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   `∫[θ=0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    Multiplying the results:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
