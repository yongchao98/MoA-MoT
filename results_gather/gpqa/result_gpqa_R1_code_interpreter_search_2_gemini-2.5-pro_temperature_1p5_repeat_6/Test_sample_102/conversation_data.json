    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a meta, meta-relationship.\n\n### 2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern strongly suggests that the synthesis should be designed to take advantage of *meta*-directing groups. The presence of the *ortho, para*-directing bromine group in a meta position relative to the other groups is a key challenge to address.\n\n### 3. A Plausible Direct Synthesis (The \"Textbook\" Method)\n\nThe most logical and efficient synthesis of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring with two meta-directors and one o,p-director is to introduce the o,p-director last, guided by the two meta-directors.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is treated with acetyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n2.  **Step 2: Nitration.** Acetophenone is nitrated using a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n    *   Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone\n3.  **Step 3: Bromination.** Now, the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group at position 1 and a nitro group at position 3. Both are *meta*-directors.\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 5.\n    *   The nitro group also directs the incoming bromine to position 5.\n    *   Since both groups direct the substitution to the same position, the bromination is highly regioselective, yielding the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (also named 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone).\n    *   3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n\nThis three-step synthesis is direct, logical, and known to produce the target molecule in good yield. However, this sequence is not presented as one of the options. The options provided are much longer, involving reduction and deamination steps, which suggests that an alternative strategy using a temporary directing group is intended.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Given Options\n\nLet's analyze the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by making bromobenzene. Nitration of bromobenzene (step ii) yields a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-bromobenzene as major products, because bromine is an *o,p*-director. To obtain a 1,3,5-pattern, we would need 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, which is a very minor product. Therefore, this route is not a high-yield synthesis for the target compound.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by making acetophenone (step i), then 3-bromoacetophenone (step ii), which is correct as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director. However, step (iii) is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at position 1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at position 3). These groups have conflicting directing effects, which will lead to a mixture of several isomers, not a high yield of a single product.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    This sequence starts with nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene (i), followed by reduction to aniline (ii). Steps (iii) and (iv) are diazotization of aniline followed by reduction with H3PO2. This sequence of reactions simply converts aniline back to benzene. This makes the first four steps synthetically useless, as they start with benzene and end with benzene.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it:\n    *   **i, ii:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline. This is standard.\n    *   **iii:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) of aniline. This reaction is known to fail because the lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group (a Lewis base) complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n    *   Because of this fatal flaw in step (iii), this sequence is not viable as written.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nAll the provided options contain significant chemical flaws that would prevent a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. Options B, C, and D lead to incorrect products, mixtures, or are synthetically circular. Option A contains a reaction step that is known to fail under the specified conditions.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question where one answer must be correct, we must choose the \"least wrong\" or intended answer. Often, complex multi-step synthesis questions involving amino groups use them as temporary directing groups that are removed at the end. The final steps of option A (vi. NaNO2/HCl; vii. H3PO2) represent the removal of an amino group (deamination). This suggests that a complex synthesis involving an amino directing group is the intended logic, even if the steps presented are flawed. By eliminating options B, C, and D as clearly leading to the wrong products or being nonsensical, option A remains as the only possibility, despite its severe chemical inaccuracies. The question itself is likely flawed.\n\nGiven the choices, and eliminating the others based on more definitive failures in regiochemistry or logic, option A is left as the default answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
