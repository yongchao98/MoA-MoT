    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ · B = -γS_z B`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B` and `E_down = -γ(-ħ/2)B = +γ(ħ/2)B`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the +Y direction.\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B_new = -γS_y B`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n\n### 3. Solving the Time Evolution (Method 1: Schrödinger Picture)\n\nWe can solve this by expressing the initial state `|+z>` in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H`.\n\n*   The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n*   The corresponding energy eigenvalues of `H = -γBS_y` are:\n    *   `E_+y = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2` (for eigenstate `|+y>`)\n    *   `E_-y = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2` (for eigenstate `|-y>`)\n*   We can write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2)|+y> + (1/√2)|-y>`\n*   Now we can apply the time evolution operator:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) [ (1/√2)|+y> + (1/√2)|-y> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2)exp(-iE_+y t/ħ)|+y> + (1/√2)exp(-iE_-y t/ħ)|-y>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2)exp(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ)|+y> + (1/√2)exp(-i(γBħ/2)t/ħ)|-y>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2)[ exp(iγBt/2)|+y> + exp(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n\nLet's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`.\n\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2)[ exp(iωt/2)|+y> + exp(-iωt/2)|-y> ]`\n\nWe want to find the expectation value of `μ_z`, which is `γ<S_z>`.\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\nTo calculate this, we express `S_z` in the basis of `S_y` eigenstates: `S_z = (ħ/2)(|+y><-y| + |-y><+y|)`.\nPlugging this into the expectation value formula and using the orthogonality of `|+y>` and `|-y>`, we get:\n\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [ exp(-iωt/2) * exp(iωt/2) + exp(iωt/2) * exp(-iωt/2) ] / 2`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/4) [ 1 * exp(-iωt) + 1 * exp(iωt) ]`  (This is incorrect, let's use an easier way)\n\nLet's convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the `S_z` basis.\nRecall: `|+y> = (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>)` and `|-y> = (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>)`.\nSubstituting these into the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2)[ exp(iωt/2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + exp(-iωt/2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2)[ (exp(iωt/2) + exp(-iωt/2))|+z> + i(exp(iωt/2) - exp(-iωt/2))|-z> ]`\n\nUsing Euler's identities (`cos x = (e^{ix}+e^{-ix})/2`, `sin x = (e^{ix}-e^{-ix})/2i`):\n\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`\n\nNow it is easy to calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n\n    `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = |<+z|ψ(t)>|^2 * (ħ/2) + |<-z|ψ(t)>|^2 * (-ħ/2)`\n    `<S_z(t)> = [cos^2(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2) + [-sin^2(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2)`\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) [cos^2(ωt/2) - sin^2(ωt/2)]`\n\nUsing the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos^2(θ) - sin^2(θ)`:\n\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2) cos(ωt)`\n\n### 4. Identifying the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for `<μ_z(t)>` is a cosine function `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\nWe defined `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n### 5. Alternative Method (Heisenberg Picture / Larmor Precession)\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. A magnetic moment `μ = γS` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ x B`, which causes the angular momentum `S` to precess around the magnetic field vector according to `dS/dt = τ = γ(S x B)`.\n\nFor a magnetic field `B` in the Y-direction, the equations of motion for the components of the spin expectation value are:\n\n*   `d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>`\n*   `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`\n\nDifferentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second gives:\n\n*   `d^2<S_z>/dt^2 = γB (d<S_x>/dt) = γB (-γB <S_z>) = -(γB)^2 <S_z>`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d^2x/dt^2 = -ω^2 x`, with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
