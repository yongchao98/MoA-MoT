    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (`Pi(+)`) into a positive muon (`mu(+)`) and a muon neutrino (`nu`). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles. This is a classic relativistic two-body decay problem.\n\n### 1. Identify the Decay Process and Given Information\nThe decay is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\nGiven values are:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), `m_pi` = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), `m_mu` = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary.\n\nWe will assume the muon neutrino (`nu`) is massless, which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n*   Rest mass of nu, `m_nu` = 0 MeV/c²\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation Laws\nSince the decay happens in an isolated system, both energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\n#### Conservation of Momentum\nThe initial pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n`p_initial = 0`\n\nThe final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon (`p_mu`) and the neutrino (`p_nu`).\n`p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n\nAccording to the conservation of momentum:\n`p_initial = p_final`\n`0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n`p_mu = -p_nu`\n\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n`|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n#### Conservation of Energy\nThe initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n`E_initial = m_pi * c^2`\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`).\n`E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nAccording to the conservation of energy:\n`E_initial = E_final`\n`m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n### 3. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\nFor the muon (`mu`):\n`E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nFor the neutrino (`nu`), since `m_nu = 0`:\n`E_nu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (0)^2  =>  E_nu = p*c`\n\n### 4. Solve for the Unknowns\nWe can now set up a system of equations to solve for the kinetic energies.\n\nFrom the energy conservation equation, we can express `E_mu`:\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu`\nSince `E_nu = p*c`, this becomes:\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - p*c`\n\nNow substitute this expression for `E_mu` into its energy-momentum relation:\n`(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nExpand the left side of the equation:\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nThe `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nNow, we can solve for the momentum `p*c`:\n`2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`p*c = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi * c^2)]`\n\nLet's plug in the given values (in units of MeV):\n*   `m_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   `m_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n\n`p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n`p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Kinetic Energies\nThe kinetic energy (`KE`) is the total energy minus the rest energy (`KE = E - m*c^2`).\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (`KE_nu`)**\nFor the massless neutrino, the total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n`KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`\n`KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Muon (`KE_mu`)**\nFirst, let's find the total energy of the muon (`E_mu`) from the conservation of energy.\n`E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - E_nu = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV`\n\nNow, calculate its kinetic energy.\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`\n`KE_mu = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV`\n`KE_mu = 4.1 MeV`\n\nUsing a more precise calculation:\n`p*c` = 29.7839... MeV\n`KE_nu` = 29.7839... MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV\n`E_mu` = 139.6 - 29.7839... = 109.816... MeV\n`KE_mu` = 109.816... - 105.7 = 4.116... MeV ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
