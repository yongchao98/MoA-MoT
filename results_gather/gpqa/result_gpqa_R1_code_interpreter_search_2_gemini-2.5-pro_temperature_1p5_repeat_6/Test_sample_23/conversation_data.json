    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is given by `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), %H = `(y * 1) / (12x + y) * 100 = 14.28`.\n    *   `14.28 / 100 = y / (12x + y)` -> `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y` -> `1.714x ≈ 0.857y` -> `y/x ≈ 2`.\n    *   This gives an empirical formula of CH2.\n    *   The molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrocarbons with the formula CnH2n can be either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane, CnH2n. (For example, C6H12 has %H = 12 / (72+12) * 100 = 12/84 * 100 ≈ 14.28%).\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent, making it the most likely candidate for Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reaction**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (containing liquids A1 and A2) and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z.\n    *   This is a critical piece of information. It implies that all the compounds (A1, A2, and the components of Y) have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (a six-membered ring), then all other compounds in X and Y must also be based on a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of the components of Y is Z (cyclohexane, CnH2n).\n    *   Let the other component be B. So, Y = {B, Z}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of B gives Z.\n    *   Since B has the same carbon skeleton as Z (e.g., a C6 ring), and it hydrogenates to Z, B must be an unsaturated version of Z.\n    *   However, Y does not decolorize bromine water. An unsaturated compound like an alkene would decolorize bromine water. The only common class of unsaturated hydrocarbons that do not decolorize bromine water (under standard conditions, without a Lewis acid catalyst) is aromatic compounds.\n    *   If the skeleton is a C6 ring, the aromatic compound is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis: let B = benzene (C6H6).\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}.\n    *   This fits all the criteria for Y: It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Benzene and cyclohexane do not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Cyclohexane (Z) is a constituent.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A1 and A2.\n    *   X *decolorizes* bromine water, meaning at least one of its components has C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is described as a disproportionation. This is a type of redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it involves hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Given that X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction is likely:\n        A1 + A2 → B + Z\n    *   Substituting the identified components of Y:\n        A1 + A2 → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    *   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer reaction. One component (A1 or A2) loses hydrogen (is oxidized) to become benzene, and the other gains hydrogen (is reduced) to become cyclohexane.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A1 and one molecule of A2.\n    *   Based on the balanced chemical equation from step 4, we can use the principle of conservation of atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in Benzene) + (H atoms in Cyclohexane)\n    *   Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n6.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n    *   Can we identify A1 and A2? They must be non-conjugated, unsaturated C6-ring compounds that decolorize bromine water.\n    *   One compound must be the hydrogen donor (gets oxidized to C6H6) and one the hydrogen acceptor (gets reduced to C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogen acceptor: Starts with more than 6 H atoms, gains H to reach 12. A likely candidate is cyclohexene (C6H10). It gains 2H to become C6H12.\n    *   Hydrogen donor: Starts with more than 6 H atoms, loses H to reach 6. A likely candidate is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). It loses 2H to become C6H6.\n    *   The problem states no conjugated bonds, so we must use the non-conjugated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), not the conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   So, a possible identity for Mixture X is {1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), Cyclohexene (C6H10)}.\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogens: 8 + 10 = 18. This matches our calculation. The entire scenario is chemically consistent.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
