    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and State:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means the orbital angular momentum quantum number for each electron is $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    *   The system is in a *coupled* angular momentum state, described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   The states corresponding to definite values of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ form the *uncoupled* basis, represented by kets of the form $|l_1, l_2, m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$.\n    *   We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. An eigenvalue of $m_l \\hbar$ for $L_z$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_l$. Therefore, we are looking for the outcome where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Bases and Find the Probability:**\n    *   The probability of obtaining the measurement outcome ($m_{l1}, m_{l2}$) when the system is in the state $|l, m>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final measurement state.\n    *   Probability P = $| <l_1, l_2, m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l_1, l_2, l, m> |^2$.\n    *   Plugging in the given values, we want to calculate:\n        $P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = | <1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> |^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Clebsch-Gordan Coefficient Selection Rule:**\n    *   The term $<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are used to transform between the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>$, to be non-zero is the conservation of the magnetic quantum number:\n        $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n    *   Let's check this rule for our specific case:\n        *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n        *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n        *   The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   We compare the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) with the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$).\n    *   Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the selection rule is violated.\n    *   This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero: $<1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$). The initial state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the individual components must result in values ($m_{l1}\\hbar$, $m_{l2}\\hbar$) whose sum is equal to the total eigenvalue, i.e., $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. The outcome $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ would imply a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$, which is impossible for a system that is in a state with a total z-component of $-1\\hbar$. Thus, the probability of this event is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
