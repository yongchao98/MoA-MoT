    "Here's a breakdown of each compound to determine if it shows optical isomerism:\n\n**1. What is Optical Isomerism?**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n*   **A chiral center:** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Atropisomerism:** Restricted rotation around a single bond, leading to a stable, non-planar, and asymmetric structure. This is often seen in substituted biphenyls.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, which consists of two phenyl rings linked by a single bond.\n*   **Substituents:** There are bulky substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) at all four positions ortho to the bond connecting the rings (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   **Analysis:** The steric hindrance caused by these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This forces the rings to be non-coplanar. Because the substitution pattern on the rings is not symmetric, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in its stable, twisted conformation. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation, is called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This molecule is also known as methyl lactate.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's look at the central carbon atom (the 2nd carbon in the propanoate chain). It is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is C6H5-CO-C6H5 (diphenyl ketone).\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. A plane of symmetry can be drawn through the carbon-oxygen double bond, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. The two phenyl groups are identical. The molecule has no chiral centers or other sources of chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond). The presence of any element of symmetry like a plane or center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
