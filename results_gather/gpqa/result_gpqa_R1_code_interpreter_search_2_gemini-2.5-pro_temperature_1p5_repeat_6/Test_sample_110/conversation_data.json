    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the Michael donor.\n    *   **α,β-Unsaturated Ester:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is the Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will create a nucleophilic enolate from the ketone, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O at position 1), which are C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no** α-protons.\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Since there is only one possible position (C6) to deprotonate, the bulky base t-BuOK will abstract the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. The C6 carbon becomes the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate's nucleophilic C6 atom attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal CH₂ group of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is then protonated during the workup step to yield the final product. The added group to C6 is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product molecule has the cyclohexanone core with an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, a methyl group at C6, and the newly added `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the ethyl propanoate part is the parent chain. Let's name our product accordingly.\n    *   The product is `Ring-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)OEt`. This is a substituted ethyl propanoate. The propanoate chain is numbered starting from the carbonyl carbon as C1. So, the ring is attached at C3. The name is `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   Now, we must name the cyclohexyl substituent. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the parent chain is numbered C1'. To assign the lowest possible locants to the principal functional groups and substituents, we number the ring such that the oxo (=O) group gets the lowest number.\n    *   The attachment point is C1' (the original C6). This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   The oxo group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C1), so it is at position C2'.\n    *   The carbon with the ethyl and methyl groups (the original C2) is adjacent to C2', making it C3'.\n    *   So, the substituents on the ring are: a methyl at C1', an oxo group at C2', and an ethyl and a methyl at C3'.\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The nitro group makes the protons on the α-carbon (the carbon it's attached to) acidic. This is the Michael donor.\n    *   **α,β-Unsaturated Nitrile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is the Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base.\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nitronate):**\n    *   The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂**CH₂**NO₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion), `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting carbanion intermediate is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The product structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂) - CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain is 6 carbons long. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon:\n        `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nComparing these products with the given options:\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
