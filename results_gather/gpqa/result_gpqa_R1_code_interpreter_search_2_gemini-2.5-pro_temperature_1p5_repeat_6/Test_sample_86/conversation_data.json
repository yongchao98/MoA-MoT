    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deduce the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring with two groups attached. A benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms (C6H4).\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** This functional group must be part of the substituents.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. A group with the formula -C2H3O that includes a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n**2. Consider the Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe two substituents (acetyl group and halogen) can be arranged in three different positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta- Isomers:** In these arrangements, all four protons on the benzene ring would be in chemically different environments. This would result in a complex spectrum with four distinct signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 1H. The splitting patterns would be complex (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublets of doublets).\n*   **Para- Isomer (1,4-disubstitution):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry along the axis passing through the two substituents.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other. It also makes the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent. This results in only two signals for the aromatic protons.\n        *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a strong electron-withdrawing and deshielding group. The two protons ortho to it will appear further downfield (at a higher ppm value).\n        *   The halogen (-X) is also electron-withdrawing. The two protons ortho to it will be the second signal.\n        *   Each signal will integrate to 2H.\n        *   The two sets of protons are adjacent (ortho) to each other, so they will split each other into **doublets**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for para-haloacetophenone:**\n    *   A doublet, integrating to 2H, in the aromatic region (downfield, ~7.8-8.1 ppm).\n    *   A second doublet, integrating to 2H, in the aromatic region (~7.4-7.7 ppm).\n    *   A singlet, integrating to 3H, in the aliphatic region (~2.3-2.6 ppm).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and one singlet in the aliphatic region for 3H.\n    *   This pattern perfectly matches the prediction for a **para-haloacetophenone**. The chemical shifts are also in the expected ranges. `7.8 (2H, d)` corresponds to the protons ortho to the acetyl group, `7.6 (2H, d)` corresponds to the protons ortho to the halogen, and `2.3 (3H, s)` corresponds to the methyl protons.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (most are below 7.0 ppm). This contradicts the presence of a benzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (halobenzaldehyde), it would only have 7 carbons (C7H5XO), which contradicts the given information of 8 total carbons. If the structure is modified to include 8 carbons while being a di-substituted aldehyde, it would violate another condition (e.g., the halogen would not be on the ring). This option is inconsistent with the problem statement.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows no signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This contradicts the presence of a benzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond is Option A. The structure is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
