As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii.

    "An informed decision requires calculating the transit probability for each planet and then comparing them. The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a circular orbit, is given by the formula:\n\n*   **P_transit = R_s / a**\n\nWhere:\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the host star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2:\n\n*   **Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)**\n\nHere's the information provided in the problem:\n1.  The host stars have the same radii: **R_s1 = R_s2**.\n2.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: **P1 = P2 / 3**.\n3.  The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet_2: **M_s1 = 2 * M_s2**.\n\nSince R_s1 = R_s2, we can simplify the ratio of probabilities:\n\n*   **Ratio = a2 / a1**\n\nTo find the semi-major axes (a1 and a2), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period (P) and semi-major axis (a) to the mass of its host star (M_s). The law can be written as:\n\n*   **a³ ∝ M_s * P²**\n\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the semi-major axis:\n\n*   **a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)**\n\nNow, we can express the ratio a2 / a1 in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²) ]^(1/3)**\n\nNext, we substitute the known relationships (M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 and P1 = P2 / 3):\n\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2²) / ((2 * M_s2) * (P2 / 3)²) ]^(1/3)**\n\nWe can simplify the expression by expanding the squared term in the denominator:\n\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2²) / (2 * M_s2 * P2² / 9) ]^(1/3)**\n\nThe terms `M_s2` and `P2²` cancel out from the numerator and denominator:\n\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ 1 / (2 / 9) ]^(1/3)**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ 9 / 2 ]^(1/3)**\n*   **a2 / a1 = [ 4.5 ]^(1/3)**\n\nTo find the final ratio, we calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(f\"The ratio of transit probabilities (P_transit_1 / P_transit_2) is approximately {ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"import math\\n\\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\\nprint(f\\\"The ratio of transit probabilities (P_transit_1 / P_transit_2) is approximately {ratio:.2f}\\\")\\n\",\n    \"output\": \"The ratio of transit probabilities (P_transit_1 / P_transit_2) is approximately 1.65\\n\",\n    \"error\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n</execute_code>\n\nThe result shows that the ratio `P_transit_1 / P_transit_2` is approximately 1.65. This means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting its star is about 1.65 times higher than the probability for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The calculation has confirmed that the ratio of the transit probabilities, `P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`, is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis result indicates that Planet_1 has a probability of transiting that is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Consequently, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1 to maximize their chances of detecting a transit.\n\nMatching this conclusion with the given options:\n*   A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n*   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\n*   C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\n*   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
