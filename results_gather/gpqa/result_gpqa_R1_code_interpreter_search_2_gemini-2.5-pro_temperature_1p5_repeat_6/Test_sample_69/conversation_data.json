    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   Reaction 1: `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(red)`\n    *   Reaction 2: `C + 2D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`\n    *   Reaction 3: `C + H₂O -> A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   Reaction 4: `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent) (1:1 ratio)`\n\n2.  **Identify Key Clues:**\n    *   The hydrolysis of C (Reaction 3) is a very strong clue. It regenerates the starting material A and produces two different acids, one strong and one weak. This suggests that the ligands/components from gas B, when reacted with water, produce these two acids.\n    *   The formation of a solvent H from two gases B and D in a 1:1 ratio (Reaction 4) is also a very specific constraint.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of Gas B:**\n    Let's focus on Reaction 3. We need a gas B whose hydrolysis yields a strong acid and a weak acid.\n    *   Let's consider common gases. If B were a halogen like Cl₂, hydrolysis would give HCl (strong) and HOCl (weak), but this requires disproportionation which is not the primary reaction.\n    *   Let's consider a compound gas. The gas Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) is known to react with water in a disproportionation reaction:\n        `2NO₂(g) + H₂O(l) -> HNO₃(aq) + HNO₂(aq)`\n    *   In this reaction, Nitric Acid (HNO₃) is a **strong acid (F)**, and Nitrous Acid (HNO₂) is a **weak acid (G)**. This fits the description in Reaction 3 perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, it's highly probable that **B = NO₂**.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Identity of Gas D and Solvent H:**\n    Now let's use B=NO₂ in Reaction 4: `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` (1:1).\n    *   `D(g) + NO₂(g) -> H(solvent)`\n    *   Nitrogen dioxide exists in equilibrium with its dimer, Dinitrogen Tetroxide (N₂O₄):\n        `2NO₂(g) <=> N₂O₄(l)`\n    *   This can be written as `NO₂(g) + NO₂(g) -> N₂O₄(l)`. N₂O₄ is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 21.7 °C) and is used as a non-aqueous solvent and a powerful oxidizer. This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry if D is also NO₂.\n    *   So, we deduce:\n        *   **B = NO₂**\n        *   **D = NO₂**\n        *   **H = N₂O₄**\n\n5.  **Deduce the Identity and Symmetry of Product E:**\n    Now we look at Reaction 2: `C + 2D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Substituting D = NO₂, we get: `C + 2NO₂(g) -> E`\n    *   E is described as \"extremely hazardous\". While NO₂ is already very toxic, E is likely even more so, suggesting it could be a powerful oxidizing agent or explosive.\n    *   We don't know the identity of A or C, but we know E is formed from C and NO₂. It is very likely a nitrogen-oxygen compound. Let's consider simple, hazardous nitrogen oxides and their molecular point groups.\n        *   NO₂: Nitrogen Dioxide - Point Group **C2v**. It is hazardous.\n        *   N₂O₄: Dinitrogen Tetroxide - Point Group D2h.\n        *   N₂O₅: Dinitrogen Pentoxide - Point Group **C2v**. It is a very powerful oxidizer, sublimes at 32.4 °C, and can be explosive. It is definitely \"extremely hazardous\".\n    *   The reaction `C + 2NO₂ -> E` could plausibly form N₂O₅ if C were a red-colored metal oxide that could donate an oxygen atom (e.g., C=M-O, then M-O + 2NO₂ -> M + N₂O₅). Although we can't definitively identify A and C without more information, the most likely hazardous products with simple structures that can be formed from NO₂ have **C2v** symmetry. For example, E could be N₂O₅.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most consistent chemical path identifies B and D as NO₂. This leads to potential products E (like N₂O₅) that possess **C2v** symmetry. This matches one of the given options. While other paths can be explored, they run into significant contradictions, especially with the hydrolysis reaction. The NO₂ path provides the most chemically sound explanation for the core reactions.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E is most likely **C2v**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
