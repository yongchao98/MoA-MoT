    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\nFirst, we need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after it's diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   Initial Molarity (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V2) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Molarity (M2) = ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2\nM2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the original acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n*   **Equation:** pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   **Calculate the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3. Since they are in the same volume, the ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ **4.26**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion in water.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the moles of acid and the volume of NaOH needed.**\n    *   Moles of acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At equivalence, moles of base = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Find the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻).**\n    *   Total volume at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka\n        *   Kw (ion product of water) = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n        *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate pH at 25% titration\nKa = 1.85e-5\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# Ratio of [A-]/[HA] at 25% titration is 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Calculate pH at equivalence point\n# M_acid_diluted = (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL = 0.025 M\n# Moles_acid = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n# Vol_NaOH_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10 mL\n# Total_vol_eq = 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL = 0.050 L\n# Conc_A_minus_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * 0.02)\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial conditions:**\n    *   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   This solution is diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   The resulting solution is then titrated with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n    *   We need to find the pH at two specific points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.\n    *   We are given the acid dissociation constant for acetic acid, Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n    *   The temperature is 25 °C, which implies Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.**\n    *   The dilution formula is M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    *   M₁ (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ (final concentration) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ (or 0.040 L) of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This means 75% of the original acid (HA) remains.\n    *   This is a buffer region, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   First, calculate pKa from Ka:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   Next, determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]. Since both species are in the same volume, the ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\n        Ratio = (moles of A⁻) / (moles of HA) = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n        pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3)\n    *   This calculation can be done with a calculator or a short script.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO), which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   First, we need to find the total volume at the equivalence point. To do this, we need to find out how much NaOH was added.\n        *   Moles of acid (initial) = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n        *   At equivalence, moles of base added = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n        *   Volume of NaOH added = moles_base / M_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume at equivalence point = V_acid_solution + V_NaOH_added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   The moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) formed is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate, [A⁻], at the equivalence point = moles / total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   Now, we use the hydrolysis reaction. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression (ICE table) for the hydrolysis:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M (since Kb is small, x will be negligible compared to 0.02).\n        Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   Solve for x = [OH⁻]:\n        x = sqrt(Kb * 0.02)\n    *   Calculate pOH:\n        pOH = -log(x) = -log([OH⁻])\n    *   Finally, calculate pH:\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\n5.  **Use Python for precise calculation.**\n    *   Let's write a script to compute the exact values to avoid rounding errors and confirm the manual steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nM_acid_initial = 0.05\nV_acid_initial_L = 0.020\nV_water_L = 0.020\nM_base = 0.1\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\nV_acid_diluted_L = V_acid_initial_L + V_water_L\nM_acid_diluted = (M_acid_initial * V_acid_initial_L) / V_acid_diluted_L\n# M_acid_diluted = (0.05 * 0.020) / 0.040 = 0.025 M\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# Ratio of [A-]/[HA] at 25% titration is 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = M_acid_diluted * V_acid_diluted_L\n# Volume of base needed to reach equivalence\nV_base_eq_L = moles_acid / M_base\n# Total volume at equivalence\nV_total_eq_L = V_acid_diluted_L + V_base_eq_L\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (A-) at equivalence\nM_A_minus_eq = moles_acid / V_total_eq_L\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]\n# So, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * M_A_minus_eq)\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe code confirms the manual calculations.\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 4.57; 6.92\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 3.17; 6.73\n\nThe calculated values match option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
