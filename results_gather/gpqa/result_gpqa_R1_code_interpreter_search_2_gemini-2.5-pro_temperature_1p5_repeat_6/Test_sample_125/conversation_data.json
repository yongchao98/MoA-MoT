    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5).\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   The carbon at position 5 is a stereocenter, and it is given in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce the ketone functional group (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter at C3. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by this reaction.\n    *   The starting molecule is chiral. The attack of the hydride (from LAH) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces (top or bottom).\n    *   Because there is already a chiral center in the molecule, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally likely from both sides. However, without specific information about chelation or extreme steric hindrance, the reaction is not expected to be 100% stereoselective.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction will produce a mixture of two products, where the new stereocenter at C3 is either (R) or (S).\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The two products, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S), have one stereocenter in common (S at C5) and one that is opposite (R/S at C3). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃. The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. We need to analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Possible configurations:** (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** Let's examine this isomer. The molecule has two stereocenters, but the two ends of the molecule are identical. There is an internal plane of symmetry. This means that (2R, 4S) is an achiral molecule. Such a molecule is called a **meso compound**. Note that the (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable), so they represent the same meso compound.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and one pair of enantiomers (as a racemic mixture).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (Diastereomer A from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (Diastereomer B from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol      (Enantiomer (+) from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol      (Enantiomer (-) from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol        (Meso compound from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** and **constitutional isomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  **Diastereomer A and Diastereomer B (from Rxn I):** They are diastereomers and have different properties. They will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  **Enantiomers (+) and (-) (from Rxn II):** They are enantiomers. They will not separate and will elute as a single peak.\n3.  **Meso compound (from Rxn II):** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, it has different properties and will separate from the enantiomeric pair.\n4.  The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) are constitutional isomers. They have different molecular formulas and structures and will definitely separate from each other.\n\nSo, the distinct entities that a normal-phase column can separate are:\n*   Peak 1: Diastereomer A\n*   Peak 2: Diastereomer B\n*   Peak 3: Meso compound\n*   Peak 4: The racemic mixture of Enantiomers (+) and (-)\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture can be separated from the others, assuming the column has sufficient resolution.\n\nLet's count the peaks based on the 5 stereoisomers we identified:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
