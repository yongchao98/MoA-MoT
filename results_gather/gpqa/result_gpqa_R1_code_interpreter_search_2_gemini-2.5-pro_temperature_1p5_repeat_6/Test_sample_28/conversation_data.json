    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\n\nThe objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. To eliminate the compound, we must create a mutation that results in a non-functional protein (enzyme). The most effective way to do this is to create a mutation that either drastically shortens the protein or scrambles its amino acid sequence so severely that it cannot fold or function correctly.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Types of Mutations\n\nLet's break down the potential impact of different mutation types:\n*   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA that does not change the resulting amino acid. This has no effect on the protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a single amino acid substitution. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the new amino acid has very different chemical properties or is in a critical part of the protein (like an active site). However, many missense mutations have little to no effect.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three (e.g., deleting 1 or inserting 2). This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons. Every amino acid downstream of the mutation is changed, and a premature stop codon is often created. This almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that converts a codon for an amino acid into a stop codon. This causes the protein to be terminated prematurely. A severely truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n**Conclusion:** Nonsense and frameshift mutations are the most likely types to completely knock out protein function.\n\n### 3. Translating and Comparing the Gene Sequences\n\nTo see the effect of each mutation, we will translate the DNA sequences into their corresponding amino acid sequences. The genetic code is read in three-letter codons. We will use a standard genetic code table for translation. (Note: `*` represents a stop codon).\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Changes vs. Intact:** The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine (Phe). This part is a silent mutation.\n    *   `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**.\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n*   **Impact:** One amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). This might not be enough to disable the protein.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Changes vs. Intact:** The codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `TTC` still codes for Phenylalanine (Phe).\n    *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Impact:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis stops after only two amino acids. The resulting peptide is extremely short and will be completely non-functional.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n*   **Changes vs. Intact:** This sequence has several changes compared to the original.\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr** - **Ser**...\n*   **Impact:** This sequence contains multiple **missense mutations** (e.g., Leu -> Tyr, Thr -> Val). While multiple changes increase the likelihood of disrupting function, it is not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n*   **Changes vs. Intact:** This sequence shows a change (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr - Ser - Val...\n*   **Impact:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** (Leu -> Tyr) and an **in-frame deletion** (the Glycine amino acid is missing). An in-frame deletion is disruptive but does not scramble the rest of the protein sequence like a frameshift would. It is less certain to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing the impacts:\n*   Mutant 1 (Missense): Low probability of eliminating function.\n*   **Mutant 2 (Nonsense): Highest probability of eliminating function.**\n*   Mutant 3 (Multiple Missense): Moderate to high probability, but less certain than nonsense.\n*   Mutant 4 (Missense + In-frame Deletion): Moderate to high probability, but less certain than nonsense.\n\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most direct and reliable way to ensure a non-functional protein is produced. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, it prevents the synthesis of the enzyme, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
