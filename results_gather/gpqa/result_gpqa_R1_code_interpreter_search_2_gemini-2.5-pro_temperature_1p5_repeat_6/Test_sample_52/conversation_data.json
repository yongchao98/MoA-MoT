    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular structure:** It's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core aromatic part is therefore C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This means the molecule contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Six total signals:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring with only two signals for its aromatic protons strongly suggests a symmetrical `para` (1,4) substitution pattern. In this pattern, there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons, each giving a signal (typically a doublet). This accounts for 4 hydrogens (2H + 2H) on the aromatic ring.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a `propenyl` group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n            *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group (-CH-CH3) is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n            *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d).\n            *   This group contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n            *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group of the propenyl system (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This accounts for 3 hydrogens.\n            *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It tells us that the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or have any other alkyl chains with a -CH2- group. Since we have a -CH3 signal for the ester, the ester group must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). Both possibilities have a methyl group and no methylene group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the pieces and determine the formula:**\n    Based on the analysis, the two substituents on the C6H4 ring are:\n    1.  A propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    2.  A methyl-containing ester group (either `-COOCH3` or `-O-CO-CH3`)\n\n    Let's calculate the total number of atoms by summing up the components:\n    *   **Carbons (C):**\n        *   Aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 C\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n        *   Ester group (-COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3): 2 C\n        *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):**\n        *   Aromatic ring (C6H4): 4 H\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5 H\n        *   Ester's methyl group (-CH3): 3 H\n        *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):**\n        *   Ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n        *   **Total O = 2**\n\n3.  **Final Chemical Formula:**\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C12H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a simple script.\n```python\n# Based on the spectral data, we deduced the components of the molecule.\n# This script will sum the atoms from each component to find the chemical formula.\n\n# 1. Aromatic ring core (di-substituted benzene)\nC_aromatic = 6\nH_aromatic = 4\n\n# 2. Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)\nC_propenyl = 3\nH_propenyl = 5\n\n# 3. Ester group (e.g., methyl ester -COOCH3)\nC_ester = 2  # One from C=O, one from O-CH3\nH_ester = 3  # From the methyl group\nO_ester = 2\n\n# Summing the atoms\ntotal_C = C_aromatic + C_propenyl + C_ester\ntotal_H = H_aromatic + H_propenyl + H_ester\ntotal_O = O_ester\n\nprint(f\"The calculated chemical formula is C{total_C}H{total_H}O{total_O}.\")\n```\nThe calculated chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Given:**\n    *   **Structure Core:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogens have been replaced by two other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** \"shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\". An ester group has the structure R-COO-R'. This tells us the molecule must contain exactly two oxygen atoms (O2).\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy (Signal by Signal):**\n        *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons. If these 4 protons only give two signals, it implies a high degree of symmetry. This is characteristic of a `para` (1,4) substitution pattern, where the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side. This accounts for `4 hydrogens`.\n        *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and telling splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) usually means a proton is coupled to one proton on an adjacent carbon (causing the doublet split) and three protons on another adjacent carbon (causing the quartet split). A \"doublet\" means a proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton. This perfectly describes a `propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)`.\n            *   The H on the middle carbon (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the other vinyl H (1H) and the methyl group (3H), giving a doublet of quartets.\n            *   The H on the end carbon (`-CH=`) is split only by the middle vinyl H (1H), giving a doublet.\n            *   This propenyl group fragment has the formula `C3H5`.\n        *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:**\n            *   Signal 1: We already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This accounts for `3 hydrogens`.\n            *   Signal 2: There must be another CH3 group somewhere else.\n        *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It means there are no methylene (-CH2-) units in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A `para`-substituted benzene ring core: `C6H4`\n    *   Two oxygen atoms from the ester group: `O2`\n    *   A propenyl group substituent: `C3H5`\n    *   A second `CH3` group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Substituent:**\n    We know the second substituent contains the ester group (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group (`-CH3`), and it must not contain a `-CH2-` group. There are two possibilities for how to arrange `-COO-` and `-CH3`:\n    *   Possibility A: A methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`). This fragment has the formula `C2H3O2`.\n    *   Possibility B: An acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`). This fragment also has the formula `C2H3O2`.\n\n    In either case, the second substituent accounts for `2 carbons`, `3 hydrogens`, and the `2 oxygens`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    Now, we sum up the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4 ring) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester/methyl substituent) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4 ring) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's methyl group) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Match with the Provided Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C12H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The reasoning is also confirmed by the code execution provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
