    "*   **Analyze the problem:** The user describes a scenario involving the analysis of a synthesized peptide. The key observations are:\n    1.  **1H NMR:** Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H. This indicates the presence of two different molecular species in roughly equal amounts, where this specific proton is in a slightly different chemical environment in each species. Spin-spin coupling is not the cause.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** Two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC) at elevated temperature. Both peaks show the same mass spectrum (MS), which corresponds to the expected product. The peaks have equal intensities.\n\n*   **Evaluate the options based on the evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. Since the MS data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected product, this option is ruled out.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This refers to the accidental addition of an extra amino acid residue. This would create a product with a higher molecular weight than the expected compound. The MS data contradicts this.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore:\n        *   In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single set of peaks, not two.\n        *   On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute and would produce a single peak, not two.\n        This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them. In peptide synthesis, this can happen if one of the chiral amino acids undergoes racemization (epimerization) at its alpha-carbon during the coupling reaction or deprotection steps.\n        *   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, their protons will be in slightly different environments, leading to different chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum. This explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they will interact differently with the stationary phase of an LC column and will elute at different times, resulting in two separate peaks. This explains the LC data.\n        *   Since they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and the same molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   The detail about the LC being run at \"elevated temperature\" is significant. Another phenomenon that can cause peak duplication in NMR is slow rotation around a bond, such as the amide bond in peptides (leading to *cis/trans* isomers, which are also a type of diastereomer). However, increasing the temperature usually increases the rate of rotation, causing such peaks to broaden and coalesce into a single average peak. The fact that the peaks remain clearly defined at elevated temperature strongly suggests they are stable, configurationally different molecules (like epimers), rather than rapidly interconverting conformers (rotamers).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that fits all the experimental observations perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
