    "*   **Step 1: Identify the shape of the aperture.**\n    The problem describes an N-sided polygon where N is infinitely large. All apothems are of the same length 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, as the number of sides N approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the aperture is a circle of radius 'a'.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the physics of the problem.**\n    The problem involves Fraunhofer diffraction of a monochromatic light wave by a circular aperture. This type of diffraction produces a characteristic pattern known as the Airy pattern. The pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The minima are the dark rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Recall the formula for minima in Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture.**\n    The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by the formula involving a Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁`. The angular positions (θ) of the intensity minima (dark rings) are given by the condition:\n    `sin(θ) = z * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n    where `z` are the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(z)`, `λ` is the wavelength of the light, and 'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n\n*   **Step 4: Find the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(z).**\n    The minima correspond to the zeros of the `J₁` Bessel function. We need to find the values of `z` for which `J₁(z) = 0`.\n    *   The first zero of `J₁(z)` is approximately `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n    *   The second zero of `J₁(z)` is approximately `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the angular positions of the first two minima.**\n    The problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n\n    *   **Position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n        `θ₁ ≈ z₁ * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n        `θ₁ ≈ 3.8317 * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n        `θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n\n    *   **Position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n        `θ₂ ≈ z₂ * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n        `θ₂ ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n        `θ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima.**\n    The angular distance (Δθ) is the difference between the angular positions of the second and the first minima.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Step 7: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 λ / a`.\n    The options are:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 0.506 λ / a\n    C) 0.610 λ / a\n    D) 1.220 λ / a\n\n    Our calculated value `0.5068 λ / a` matches option B `0.506 λ / a` most closely.\n\n    For completeness:\n    *   Option C corresponds to the position of the *first* minimum (`0.610 λ/a ≈ 0.6098 λ/a`).\n    *   Option D is related to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution, which is `1.22 λ / D`, where D is the diameter (`D = 2a`). This gives `1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a`, which is again the position of the first minimum.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
