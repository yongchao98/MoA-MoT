    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the inherent uncertainty (or \"width\") of its energy level.\n\n**1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Width of Each State**\n\nWe can approximate the uncertainty in time (Δt) with the lifetime of the state (τ). The resulting energy uncertainty (ΔE) is often called the natural linewidth of the energy level. We will use the relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ for our calculation.\n\n*   **For the first state:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. The Condition for Resolving Energy Levels**\n\nFor two energy levels to be clearly resolved or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their combined energy widths. At a minimum, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties:\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\n**4. Calculating the Minimum Required Energy Difference**\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the energy widths:\nSum of widths = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nSum of widths ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nSum of widths ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nSum of widths ≈ 7.238 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nTherefore, to clearly distinguish these two levels, their energy difference must be greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nWe now check which of the given options satisfies this condition: |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two energy levels, as it is several orders of magnitude larger than the minimum required separation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
