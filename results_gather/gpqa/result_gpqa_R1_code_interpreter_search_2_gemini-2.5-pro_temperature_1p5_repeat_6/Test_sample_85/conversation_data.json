    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure and Nomenclature**\n\nThe products of both reactions are stereoisomers of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's deconstruct this name to understand the structure:\n*   **Pyran**: A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is located at position 2 of the ring.\n*   **2H**: This part of the name is standard for pyranones and indicates the saturated carbon at position 2 in the unsaturated parent, but in the tetrahydro version it is implicit.\n*   **O is at position 1**: By convention for heterocyclic nomenclature, the heteroatom (Oxygen) is assigned position 1. The carbonyl group must then be given the lowest possible number, which is 2.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n\nLet's sketch the ring and trace its linear precursor, a hydroxy acid. The formation of a lactone is an intramolecular esterification. Hydrolyzing the lactone (breaking the O1-C2 ester bond) reveals the structure of the parent hydroxy acid.\n\n*   **Lactone:** O(1)-C(2)(=O)-C(3)-C(4)(Et)-C(5)-C(6)-\n*   **Hydrolysis:** Breaking the O1-C2 bond and adding H to O1 and OH to C2.\n*   **Linear hydroxy acid:** HO-C(6)H₂-C(5)H₂-C(4)H(Et)-C(3)H₂-C(2)OOH.\n*   **IUPAC name of the hydroxy acid:** We number the chain starting from the carboxylic acid (COOH) as C1.\n    *   HOOC(from C2) is C1'.\n    *   CH₂(from C3) is C2'.\n    *   CH(Et)(from C4) is C3'. The ethyl group is on C3'.\n    *   CH₂(from C5) is C4'.\n    *   CH₂OH(from C6 and O1) is C5'. The hydroxyl group is on C5'.\n*   So, the precursor acid is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n*   The chiral center in the lactone is C4, which corresponds to C3 in the precursor acid. So, (R)-4-ethyl...lactone is formed from (R)-3-ethyl...acid, and (S)-lactone from (S)-acid, as the chiral center is not involved in the reactions.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   **Pentanoic acid**: A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (COOH) as the principal functional group (at C1).\n*   **3-ethyl**: An ethyl group on C3.\n*   **5-oxo** and **5-isobutoxy**: An oxo (=O) and an isobutoxy group (-OCH₂(CH₃)₂) on the same carbon (C5) indicates an ester group: -C(=O)O-isobutyl.\n*   **Structure**: Combining these parts gives `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`. This is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). The molecule has a chiral center at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reactants**: Compound A + LiBH₄ + H⁺\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is more reactive towards esters than carboxylic acids. It will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Reaction Path**:\n    1.  `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu)` --LiBH₄--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` + `iBu-OH`\n    2.  The intermediate is **3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid**.\n    3.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization (esterification) to form the lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The reactions (reduction of a remote ester and cyclization) do not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is (R)-lactone, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reactants**: Compound B + BH₃ + H⁺\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity**: Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that shows the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It reduces carboxylic acids much more readily than it reduces esters.\n*   **Reaction Path**:\n    1.  `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu)` --BH₃--> `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CO-O-iBu`\n    2.  The intermediate is **isobutyl 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate**.\n    3.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular cyclization (transesterification), where the -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) to form the same lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Similar to Reaction A, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction, and its configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the product is (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
