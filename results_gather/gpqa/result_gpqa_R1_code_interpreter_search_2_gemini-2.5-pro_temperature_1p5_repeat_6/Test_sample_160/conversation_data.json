    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between the two mean free paths, λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Define λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    *   λ1 is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   In the kinetic theory of gases, when all particles are moving, the formula for the mean free path (MFP) is:\n        $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_1}$\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ₁` is the collision cross-section for a molecule-molecule collision. In a simple hard-sphere model, this is $\\sigma_1 = \\pi d^2$, where `d` is the kinetic diameter of the gas molecule.\n        *   The factor $\\sqrt{2}$ accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving, which increases the relative speed and collision frequency compared to stationary targets.\n\n2.  **Define λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    *   λ2 is the average distance an electron travels before scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them highly relativistic and extremely fast compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules.\n    *   Because the electron's speed is so much greater than the molecule's speed, we can treat the gas molecules as stationary targets.\n    *   The MFP formula for a fast particle moving through stationary targets is:\n        $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma_2}$\n    *   Where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ₂` is the collision cross-section for an electron-molecule collision.\n\n3.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    *   To compare λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{1 / (n \\sigma_2)}{1 / (\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma_1}{n \\sigma_2} = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2}$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂)**\n    *   The entire comparison now depends on the ratio of the two cross-sections: $\\sigma_1$ (molecule-molecule) and $\\sigma_2$ (electron-molecule).\n    *   **Simple Hard-Sphere Model:**\n        *   For a molecule-molecule collision (two spheres of diameter `d` hitting each other), the cross-section is $\\sigma_1 = \\pi d^2$.\n        *   For an electron-molecule collision, we treat the electron as a point particle and the molecule as a sphere of diameter `d` (radius `d/2`). The cross-section is the area of the circle the point must enter, which is $\\sigma_2 = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$.\n        *   In this model, $\\sigma_1 = 4\\sigma_2$, so the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2} = 4$.\n    *   **Physical Reality:** The electron is a point charge, and its interaction with the molecule's electric field (from its own electron cloud and nucleus) is complex. However, for a very high-energy electron (1000 keV), the interaction time is extremely short. The electron must pass very close to the molecule to be significantly scattered. This results in an effective cross-section (`σ₂`) that is generally *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ₁`). So, physically, we expect $\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2} > 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths**\n    *   We have the relationship: $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2}$.\n    *   **Case 1 (Simplest assumption):** Let's assume, against the hard-sphere model, that the cross-sections are equal for simplicity, i.e., $\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2} = 1$. Even in this case, the ratio is:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n    *   **Case 2 (Hard-sphere model):** Using the more plausible hard-sphere result where $\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2} = 4$:\n        $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 4 = 4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 5.66$\n    *   In any physically plausible scenario, the factor from relative motion ($\\sqrt{2}$) and the factor from the cross-section ratio ($\\sigma_1/\\sigma_2 > 1$) both work to make $\\lambda_2$ larger than $\\lambda_1$. The absolute minimum reasonable value for the ratio is $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options**\n    *   Our analysis robustly concludes that $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} \\ge \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.\n    *   Now let's check the given options:\n        A) $\\lambda_2 < \\lambda_1$: Incorrect. The ratio is > 1.\n        B) $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_1$: Incorrect. The ratio is > 1.\n        C) $\\lambda_2 \\ge 1.22 \\lambda_1$: This is correct. Since our calculated ratio is always $\\ge 1.414$, it is certainly also $\\ge 1.22$.\n        D) $\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2 < 1.22 \\lambda_1$: Incorrect. This means the ratio is between 1 and 1.22, which contradicts our finding that the ratio is $\\ge 1.414$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe mean free path of electrons (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1). This is due to two main reasons:\n1.  The high speed of the electrons makes the target gas molecules effectively stationary, removing a $\\sqrt{2}$ factor that decreases the mean free path for molecule-molecule collisions.\n2.  The effective collision cross-section for a small, fast electron hitting a molecule is smaller than that for two molecules hitting each other.\n\nBoth effects lead to the conclusion that $\\lambda_2 > \\lambda_1$. More specifically, the ratio $\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_1$ is at least $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$. Therefore, the statement $\\lambda_2 \\ge 1.22 \\lambda_1$ must be true.\n\n<<<C>>>"
