    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the atoms and bonds correctly. The condensed structural formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break it down and count the atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 C in the chain, 2 C in methyl groups, 6 H in methyl groups. (Total: 3 C, 6 H)\n*   `=CH-`: 1 C in the chain, 1 H.\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C in the chain, 2 H.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain, 1 C in a methyl group, 1 H on the chain, 3 H in the methyl group. (Total: 2 C, 4 H)\n*   `-CH2-`: 1 C in the chain, 2 H.\n*   `-CH=`: 1 C in the chain, 1 H.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C in the chain, 2 C in methyl groups, 6 H in methyl groups. (Total: 3 C, 6 H)\n\n**Total Carbon (C) atoms:** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n**Total Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we calculate the molar mass (using integer atomic weights C=12, H=1 for consistency with the simplified data).\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nLet's carefully count the bonds from the structure:\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: `C=CH` and `CH=C`.\n    *   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n*   **C-C single bonds:**\n    *   Bonds within the main carbon chain: 4 (C=**C-C**-C-**C-C**=C)\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the chain: 2 on the first C, 1 on the fourth C, 2 on the last C. (2 + 1 + 2 = 5)\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = 9\n*   **C-H single bonds:** The total number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom.\n    *   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to find the enthalpy change to convert the reactants into gaseous atoms:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nUsing the given data:\n*   Enthalpy for atomizing Carbon = 12 mol * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Enthalpy for atomizing Hydrogen = 11 mol * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form one mole of the product molecule. It's the sum of all bond energies in the C12H22 molecule.\n\nUsing the bond counts and given bond energies:\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (300 kJ/mol) = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (200 kJ/mol) = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (400 kJ/mol) = 8800 kJ\n\nTotal bond energy of the product = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product's bonds.\n\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **6. Convert to Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Our calculated answer is 1900 kJ/mol.\n*   Option B is 11200 kJ/mol, which is the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation.\n*   Option D is 67.4 kJ/mol.\n*   Option C is 1900 kJ/g, which has the correct numerical value but incorrect units.\n*   Option A is 11.44 kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to these units.\n\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis matches Option A.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100          # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_single = 200   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC_double = 300   # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400          # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1: Molecular formula and bond count for (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\n\n# Step 2: Molar Mass\nmolar_mass_C = 12  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_H = 1   # g/mol\nmolar_mass_molecule = num_C_atoms * molar_mass_C + num_H_atoms * molar_mass_H\n\n# Step 3: Enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C(s) + 11 H2(g))\n# Energy to form 12 C(g) and 22 H(g)\ntotal_enthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C_atoms * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H_atoms / 2 * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Step 4: Total bond energy of the product molecule (C12H22)\ntotal_bond_energy_product = (num_CC_double_bonds * bond_energy_CC_double) + \\\n                             (num_CC_single_bonds * bond_energy_CC_single) + \\\n                             (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH)\n\n# Step 5: Enthalpy of formation (in kJ/mol)\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = total_enthalpy_atomization_reactants - total_bond_energy_product\n\n# Step 6: Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nenthalpy_of_formation_gram = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / molar_mass_molecule\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_of_formation_gram}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n<<<A>>>",
    "An explanation of the method and the final answer has already been provided.\n\n**Detailed step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass:**\n    *   The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Count the Carbon atoms: 2(from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1(from CH3) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2(from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Count the Hydrogen atoms: 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is C12H22.\n    *   The molar mass is (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Count the Bonds:**\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the chain. (Count = 2)\n    *   **C-C bonds:** There are 4 single bonds in the main backbone and 5 single bonds connecting the methyl groups. (Count = 4 + 5 = 9)\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds. (Count = 22)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:**\n    The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\n    *   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total energy input to create gaseous atoms from elements in their standard state = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ. This is ΣΔH(atomization).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Product:**\n    This is the energy released when the gaseous atoms combine to form the molecule.\n    *   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Total energy released on bond formation = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol. This is Σ(Bond Energies).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):**\n    ΔHf = ΣΔH(atomization of reactants) - Σ(Bond Energies of product)\n    ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g:**\n    The question has an answer option in kJ/g. We convert our result.\n    ΔHf (in kJ/g) = (ΔHf in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n    ΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value rounds to 11.44 kJ/g, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
