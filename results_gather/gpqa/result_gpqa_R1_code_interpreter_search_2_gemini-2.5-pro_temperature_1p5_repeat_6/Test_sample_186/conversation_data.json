    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### 1. Understand the Detection Criteria\nA star is considered \"detectable\" if the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT), can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### 2. Determine the Limiting Magnitude of ESPRESSO\nWe need to find the faintest apparent magnitude (V) a star can have to meet the detection criteria. According to the official ESO webpage for ESPRESSO (provided in the prompt):\n*   **Instrument setup:** 1-UT mode (a single 8m VLT).\n*   **Performance:** In the Medium Resolution (MR, R=70,000) mode, ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 for a star with **V = 17.7 mag** in a 1-hour exposure. In the High Resolution (HR, R=140,000) mode, the limit is V = 16.5 mag.\n*   We will use the more optimistic value of **V = 17.7 mag** as our limiting magnitude. A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude `m_V` is less than or equal to 17.7 (`m_V <= 17.7`) and it is visible from the observatory.\n\n### 3. Determine the Visibility of Each Star from Paranal Observatory\n*   **Observatory:** Paranal Observatory (home of the VLT).\n*   **Latitude:** Approximately 24.6° South.\n*   An object's visibility depends on its declination (celestial latitude). For an observer in the southern hemisphere, stars far in the northern sky may never rise above the horizon. An object is visible if its declination `δ` is less than `90° - |latitude|`. For Paranal, `δ < 90° - 24.6° = 65.4°`.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Star\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52°. Since -52° < 65.4°, it is **visible** from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the sky, with m_V = -0.74.\n*   **Detection:** Is -0.74 ≤ 17.7? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris (the North Star) has a declination of approximately +89°. Since +89° is not less than 65.4°, it is **not visible** from Paranal. It never rises above the horizon.\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** The star has a declination of 0° (on the celestial equator). Since 0° < 65.4°, it is **visible** from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** We use the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = 15.0`.\n*   **Detection:** Is 15.0 ≤ 17.7? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.5`.\n*   **Detection:** Is 21.5 ≤ 17.7? No.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.5`.\n*   **Detection:** Is 13.5 ≤ 17.7? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is **visible**.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.5`.\n*   **Detection:** Is 18.5 ≤ 17.7? No.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n### 5.

    "To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must consider two main factors:\n1.  **Visibility from the Paranal Observatory:** The star must rise high enough above the horizon to be observed. Paranal is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. A good rule of thumb is that a star is observable if its declination (δ) is less than 90° - |latitude|, so δ < 65.4°.\n2.  **Apparent Magnitude:** The star must be bright enough for ESPRESSO to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure. According to the ESPRESSO overview, using a single 8m VLT in Medium Resolution (MR) mode, this corresponds to a limiting apparent V magnitude of **V ≤ 17.7**.\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of about -53°. Since -53° < 65.4°, it is easily **visible** from Paranal.\n    *   **Magnitude:** Its apparent magnitude is V = -0.74. This is much brighter (a smaller number) than the limit of 17.7.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Polaris has a declination of about +89°. Since +89° is not less than 65.4°, it **never rises** above the horizon at Paranal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable**.\n\nFor the next four stars, we first need to calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) from their absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`. All have a declination of 0°, which is visible from Paranal (0° < 65.4°).\n\n*   **c) d = 10 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15.0.\n    *   **Detection:** 15.0 is less than 17.7.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n*   **d) d = 200 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.30) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5.\n    *   **Detection:** 21.5 is greater than 17.7.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable**.\n\n*   **e) d = 5 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.70) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5.\n    *   **Detection:** 13.5 is less than 17.7.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Detectable**.\n\n*   **f) d = 50 pc:**\n    *   **Magnitude:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.70) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5.\n    *   **Detection:** 18.5 is greater than 17.7.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Not detectable**.\n\nIn total, the detectable stars are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, and the star at 5 pc. This gives a total of **3** detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
