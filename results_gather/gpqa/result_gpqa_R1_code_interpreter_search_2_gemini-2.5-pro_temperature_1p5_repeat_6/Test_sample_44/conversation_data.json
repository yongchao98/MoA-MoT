    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Key Principle:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum States:** A particle's state in this system is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number *n* (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number *m_s* (m_s = +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down).\n\n### 2. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nThe problem provides a unit of energy:\nE = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nSo, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\nE_n = n² * E\n\n*   For n=1, E₁ = 1² * E = 1E\n*   For n=2, E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n*   For n=3, E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n*   For n=4, E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n*   And so on.\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, since there are two possible spin states (up and down) for each energy level *n*, each level E_n can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Energies\n\n#### Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   The first two particles fill the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The next two particles fill the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_ground = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n#### First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level (in the ground state) to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   Highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   Lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   New configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states:\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Next lowest energy state: 18E\n*   Next after that: 20E\n\nSo, the second excited state corresponds to the energy of 18E.\n\n### 4. Summary and Final Answer\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
