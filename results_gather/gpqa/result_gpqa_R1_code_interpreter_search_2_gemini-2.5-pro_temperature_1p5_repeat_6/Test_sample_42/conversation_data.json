    "1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), and methoxy (-OCH₃). According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the priority of these groups is:\n    Carboxylic acid > Carbaldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\n    Therefore, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, and the molecule will be named as a derivative of benzoic acid. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of Substituents (Locants):**\n    *   **C1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **para to carboxylic acid (C4):** The description states a methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid. So, the methoxy group is at C4.\n    *   **meta groups:** The carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all meta to one another. This means they must be at positions 1, 3, and 5. Since C1 is the carboxylic acid, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5.\n    *   **ortho to carboxylic acid:** A hydroxyl group and a dimethylamino group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at C2 and C6.\n    *   **Cross-verification:** The description provides a crucial check: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" Let's test the two possibilities for the C3/C5 and C2/C6 assignments.\n\n    *   **Possibility 1:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CHO (carbaldehyde/formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n        In this arrangement, the methoxy group (C4) and the hydroxyl group (C2) are *not* both ortho to the cyano group (C5). The methoxy is ortho, but the hydroxyl is meta. This contradicts the description.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2:**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (carbaldehyde/formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        In this arrangement, the methoxy group (C4) and the hydroxyl group (C6) are both ortho to the cyano group (C5). This arrangement is consistent with all parts of the description.\n\n3.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   **Base name:** benzoic acid\n    *   **Substituents and their locants:**\n        *   5-cyano\n        *   2-dimethylamino\n        *   3-formyl (the prefix for a -CHO group when a higher priority group is present)\n        *   6-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   **Alphabetize the substituents:**\n        1.  cyano\n        2.  dimethylamino\n        3.  formyl\n        4.  hydroxy\n        5.  methoxy\n    *   **Combine:** Place the alphabetized substituents with their locants before the base name.\n        5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The constructed name, `5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid`, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
