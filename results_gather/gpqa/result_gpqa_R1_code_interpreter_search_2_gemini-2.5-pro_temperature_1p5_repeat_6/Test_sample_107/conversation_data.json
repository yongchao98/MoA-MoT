    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy `⟨H⟩` for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field with a specific electronic transition energy `ΔE`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Paramagnetic Coupling Term `⟨H⟩`:**\n    *   The interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field `B` is described by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction (the paramagnetic coupling term) is given by:\n        `H = -μ ⋅ B`\n    *   The magnetic dipole moment `μ` is proportional to the orbital angular momentum `L`:\n        `μ = - (e / 2m_e) * L`\n        where `e` is the elementary charge and `m_e` is the mass of the electron.\n    *   We can express this using the Bohr magneton, `μ_B = eħ / 2m_e`:\n        `μ = - (μ_B / ħ) * L`\n    *   Substituting this into the Hamiltonian expression:\n        `H = - ( - (μ_B / ħ) * L ) ⋅ B = (μ_B / ħ) * L ⋅ B`\n    *   The problem states the magnetic field `B` is parallel to the `Oz` axis, so `B = (0, 0, B)`. The dot product `L ⋅ B` simplifies to `L_z * B`.\n        `H = (μ_B * B / ħ) * L_z`\n    *   We need the expectation value `⟨H⟩`. The expectation value of the `L_z` operator for a state with orbital magnetic quantum number `m` is `mħ`.\n        `⟨H⟩ = ⟨(μ_B * B / ħ) * L_z⟩ = (μ_B * B / ħ) * ⟨L_z⟩ = (μ_B * B / ħ) * (mħ)`\n    *   This simplifies to the final formula for the energy shift:\n        `⟨H⟩ = m * μ_B * B`\n    *   Now, we need to plug in the given values:\n        *   Magnetic field, `B = 1 T`.\n        *   The problem states \"small values of m\". For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can choose the smallest non-zero integer value, `m = 1`.\n        *   The value of the Bohr magneton, `μ_B`, is a fundamental constant. It is most convenient to use its value in units of electron-volts per Tesla (eV/T): `μ_B ≈ 5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T`.\n    *   Calculate `⟨H⟩`:\n        `⟨H⟩ = 1 * (5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T) * (1 T) = 5.788 × 10^-5 eV`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transition Energy `ΔE`:**\n    *   The problem gives a transition wavelength `λ = 0.4861 μm`. This corresponds to a specific electronic transition in the hydrogen atom.\n    *   The energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during this transition is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n        `ΔE = E_photon = hc / λ`\n    *   We need the values for the constants:\n        *   Planck's constant, `h`.\n        *   Speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The product `hc` is often used as a combined constant in atomic physics, with a very convenient value: `hc ≈ 1240 eV⋅nm`.\n    *   First, convert the given wavelength `λ` from micrometers (μm) to nanometers (nm):\n        `λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1 nm`\n    *   Now, calculate `ΔE`:\n        `ΔE = hc / λ ≈ (1240 eV⋅nm) / (486.1 nm) ≈ 2.55 eV`\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes:**\n    *   We have calculated the two energies:\n        `⟨H⟩ ≈ 5.788 × 10^-5 eV`\n        `ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV`\n    *   Let's look at the ratio to see how they compare:\n        `ΔE / ⟨H⟩ ≈ 2.55 / (5.788 × 10^-5) ≈ 44055`\n    *   This shows that the transition energy `ΔE` is more than 40,000 times larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy `⟨H⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the transition energy. This relationship is best described as:\n        `⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE`\n\n5.  **Final Check using Python for precision:**\nTo ensure the accuracy of the manual calculation, we can use a Python script with more precise constants.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define physical constants\nmu_B_eV_T = 5.7883818012e-5  # Bohr magneton in eV/T\nh = 4.135667696e-15          # Planck's constant in eV*s\nc = 299792458                # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Input parameters from the problem\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6  # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>\nH_coupling_eV = m * mu_B_eV_T * B\n\n# Calculate the transition energy Delta E\nDelta_E_eV = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# Print the results to compare\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_coupling_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {Delta_E_eV:.3f} eV\")\n\n# Determine the relationship\nif H_coupling_eV < Delta_E_eV:\n    ratio = Delta_E_eV / H_coupling_eV\n    if ratio > 100: # Define \"much less than\" as a factor of 100 or more\n        relationship = \"<H> << Delta E\"\n    else:\n        relationship = \"<H> < Delta E\"\nelif H_coupling_eV > Delta_E_eV:\n    ratio = H_coupling_eV / Delta_E_eV\n    if ratio > 100:\n        relationship = \"<H> >> Delta E\"\n    else:\n        relationship = \"<H> > Delta E\"\nelse:\n    relationship = \"<H> = Delta E\"\n    \nprint(f\"The ratio Delta_E / <H> is approximately {Delta_E_eV / H_coupling_eV:.0f}.\")\nprint(f\"The relationship is: {relationship}\")\n```\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> = 5.788e-05 eV\nTransition energy Delta E = 2.551 eV\nThe ratio Delta_E / <H> is approximately 44070.\nThe relationship is: <H> << Delta E\n\nThe Python calculation confirms the manual reasoning. The paramagnetic coupling energy (`~10^-5` eV) is several orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy (`~1` eV).\n\nThis result makes physical sense. The Zeeman splitting caused by typical laboratory magnetic fields is a very small perturbation compared to the energy differences between principal electron shells in an atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is `A) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE`.\n\n---\n\nIn LaTeX format, the calculations are:\n\n**Paramagnetic Coupling Energy `⟨H⟩`:**\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B $$\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 1 \\cdot (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\cdot (1 \\text{ T}) \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $$\n\n**Transition Energy `ΔE`:**\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 486.1 \\text{ nm} $$\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV} $$\n\n**Comparison:**\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nSince the ratio is extremely small, we conclude:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E $$\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy `⟨H⟩` with a specific electronic transition energy `ΔE` in a hydrogen atom.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy `⟨H⟩`**\n\nThe energy of interaction of an atomic magnetic moment with an external magnetic field B (Zeeman effect) is given by the Hamiltonian `H = -μ ⋅ B`. The energy shift, which is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian, is:\n\n`⟨H⟩ = m * μ_B * B`\n\nwhere:\n- `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number.
