    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a key indicator of an O-H stretch involved in strong hydrogen bonding. This is highly characteristic of the hydroxyl group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H peak and a C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the molecule also contains an alkene (C=C). Therefore, the unknown compound is likely an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate its mass:\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12.01\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.00\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1.01\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ fragment = 12.01 + 16.00 + 16.00 + 1.01 ≈ 45\n    *   This fragment corresponds to the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. This provides definitive evidence that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From all three techniques, we have confirmed the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen.\n    *   We are left with A (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2). Now we must use the information about unsaturation (the C=C bond).\n    *   We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining formulas. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   For **C6H12O2** (Option C): DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 would account for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group. However, this formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), meaning it has no C=C double bonds. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   For **C6H10O2** (Option A): DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. A DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid (1 DoU) and the C=C double bond of the alkene (1 DoU).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid) and has two degrees of unsaturation (for the C=O and C=C bonds).\n\n<<<A>>>"
