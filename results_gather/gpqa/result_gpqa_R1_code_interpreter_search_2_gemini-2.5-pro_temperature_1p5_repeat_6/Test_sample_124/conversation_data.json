    "An analysis of the quantum mechanical system is performed to determine the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three axes.\n\n2.  **Energy Eigenvalues:** The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, is separable in Cartesian coordinates. The Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial q_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q_i^2$ for $q_i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\n3.  The energy eigenvalue of a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\n4.  For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three 1D oscillators:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{N} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. Let's define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels can then be written as:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $N=0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n5.  **Identify the Excited States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** $N=0$. This corresponds to $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. Degeneracy is 1.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $N=1$. The possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. Degeneracy is 3.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $N=2$. The sum $n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $N=3$. This is the state we are interested in. The energy is:\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $N$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\n    This is a classic combinatorics problem. The number of ways to distribute $N$ identical items into $k$ distinct bins is given by the \"stars and bars\" formula: $\\binom{N+k-1}{k-1}$.\n    In our case, $N=3$ (the energy quantum number) and $k=3$ (the number of dimensions/oscillators).\n    Degeneracy $g = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n    To be certain, we can enumerate the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n    *   One quantum number is 3: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - 3 states.\n    *   One quantum number is 2, another is 1: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - 6 states.\n    *   All quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1) - 1 state.\n    Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    I can use a Python script to verify this calculation.\n```python\ndef calculate_degeneracy(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the degeneracy of the N-th energy level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n    The degeneracy is the number of ways to write N as a sum of 3 non-negative integers.\n    The formula is g = (N+1)(N+2)/2.\n    This script also enumerates the states to verify the formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    combinations = []\n    for nx in range(N + 1):\n        for ny in range(N + 1 - nx):\n            nz = N - nx - ny\n            combinations.append(f\"({nx}, {ny}, {nz})\")\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Using the formula\n    formula_degeneracy = (N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2\n    \n    print(f\"For N = {N}:\")\n    # print(f\"Combinations: {', '.join(combinations)}\")\n    print(f\"Degeneracy (from enumeration): {count}\")\n    print(f\"Degeneracy (from formula g=(N+1)(N+2)/2): {formula_degeneracy}\")\n\n# We need the third excited state, which corresponds to N=3.\n# N=0 is the ground state.\n# N=1 is the first excited state.\n# N=2 is the second excited state.\n# N=3 is the third excited state.\ncalculate_degeneracy(3)\n```\n<execute_result>\nFor N = 3:\nDegeneracy (from enumeration): 10\nDegeneracy (from formula g=(N+1)(N+2)/2): 10\n</execute_result>\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of possible linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) (9/2) ħω, 10 - This matches our result.\n    *   B) (9/2) ħω, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\n    *   C) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10 - Incorrect energy expression.

    "The user's question is about a quantum mechanical system, specifically a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. We need to find the energy and the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for the third excited state.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:** The given potential is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The \"isotropic\" nature means the frequency of oscillation, $\\omega$, is the same in all three directions.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian and Energy Eigenvalues:** The Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates:\n    $H = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2z^2\\right)$\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    Each term, $H_i$, is the Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator.\n\n    The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\n    For the 3D isotropic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    We can define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $N=0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n    $E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy States:**\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy state, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $N$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$, the minimum value for $N$ is $N=0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). The energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $N=1$. The energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$. The energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$. The energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of distinct combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $N$. We need to find the degeneracy for the third excited state, which is for $N=3$. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\n    We can list them out:\n    *   Sets with a 3: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n    *   Sets with a 2 and a 1: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n    *   Sets with all 1s: (1,1,1) — 1 state\n    Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the formula for the degeneracy of the N-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, which is given by:\n    $g_N = \\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $N=3$, so the degeneracy is:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Comparison with Options:**\n    *   The energy of the third excited state ($N=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The degeneracy of this state is 10.\n\n    Now we check the given options:\n    A) (9/2) ħω , 10 - This matches our calculated energy and degeneracy.\n    B) (9/2) ħω, 3 - The degeneracy is incorrect.\n    C) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10 - The energy expression is incorrect. This form is characteristic of a particle in a spherical box, not a harmonic oscillator.\n    D) 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3 - Both energy and degeneracy are incorrect.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
