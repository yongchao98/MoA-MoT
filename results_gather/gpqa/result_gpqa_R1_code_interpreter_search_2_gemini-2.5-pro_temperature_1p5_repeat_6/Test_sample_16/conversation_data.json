    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem involves a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA (which we'll denote as $Y^{4-}$ for simplicity). The reaction is a dissociation reaction.\n\n2.  **Write the Chemical Equation:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the reverse of its formation.\n    The formation reaction is: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The dissociation reaction is: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** The problem gives the formation constant (also called the stability constant), $K_f = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We are given that the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The goal is to find the concentration of calcium ions, which is 'x' at equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n7.  **Make a Simplifying Assumption:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$). This means the complex is very stable and will not dissociate much. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can assume that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n8.  **Calculate x:** Now, solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The dissociation constant, Kd = 1 / Kf\nKd = 1 / (5e10)\n\n# The initial concentration of the complex\nC_complex = 0.02\n\n# The equilibrium equation is x^2 / (C_complex - x) = Kd.\n# Using the approximation x^2 ≈ Kd * C_complex\nx_squared = Kd * C_complex\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The result 'x' is the concentration of Ca2+ ions.\nprint(f\"{x:.1e}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\n6.3e-07\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 2.0x10^-2 M\nB) 6.3x10^-7 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, in a solution prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, will slightly dissociate in water to establish an equilibrium.\n\n**1. Write the chemical equilibrium reaction:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, which we can write as $[CaY]^{2-}$, dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$):\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n**2. Determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction:**\nThe problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which is for the reverse reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$).\n$K_f = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\times 10^{10}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\nWe start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no initial free calcium or EDTA ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|:----------------|:------------|:-----------|:----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n**4. Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:**\nThe equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n$2.0 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large ($K_f \\gg 1$), the dissociation constant is very small ($K_d \\ll 1$). This means the complex is very stable and will dissociate very little. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n$2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
