    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (δ):** 2.1 ppm. This chemical shift is typical for protons on a methyl group (CH₃) that is attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration:** The signal corresponds to 3H (three protons), which is consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** 's' stands for singlet, meaning these three protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal (2.1 ppm, 3H, s) strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH₃C=O). Since all four possible compounds are acetates, this is consistent with all options. The general structure is R-O-C(=O)CH₃.\n\n2.  **Determine the nature of the 'R' group (Propenyl vs. Butenyl):**\n    *   The remaining signals must describe the 'R' group attached to the ester oxygen. These signals are: 7.0 (1H), 5.5 (1H), and 1.6 (3H).\n    *   Let's sum the number of protons in the R group: 1H + 1H + 3H = 5 protons.\n    *   Now, let's look at the possible R groups:\n        *   **Propenyl group** (as in propenyl acetate, CH₃-CH=CH-): This group has 3 protons from the methyl group and 2 protons on the double bond, for a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 protons. This matches our data.\n        *   **Butenyl group** (as in butenyl acetate, e.g., CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-): This group would have more than 5 protons. For example, crotyl (but-2-enyl) would have 7 protons in its 'R' group (CH₃ + CH + CH + CH₂).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the NMR data shows 5 protons in the R group, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options A) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Distinguish between Cis and Trans isomers:**\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between them lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two protons on the C=C double bond.\n    *   Let's draw the structure and label the protons: CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-COCH₃.\n    *   The signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm belong to the vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c). The signal at 1.6 ppm belongs to the methyl protons, H(a).\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet (**d**) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This splitting is caused by the adjacent vinylic proton.\n    *   The value of the vicinal coupling constant (³J) across a double bond is stereospecific:\n        *   For a **trans** configuration, the coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, ranging from **12 to 18 Hz**.\n        *   For a **cis** configuration, the coupling constant (³J_cis) is significantly smaller, ranging from **6 to 12 Hz**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** double bond.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   **Structure:** Trans-propenyl acetate.\n    *   **Signal Assignments:**\n        *   **2.1 (3H, s):** Acetate methyl protons (-O-C(=O)**CH₃**).\n        *   **7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** Vinylic proton H(c) (the one attached to the oxygen-bearing carbon). It is a doublet because it's only coupled to H(b). The large J-value confirms the trans relationship. Its high chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen.\n        *   **5.5 (1H, dq):** Vinylic proton H(b). It is a doublet of quartets because it's coupled to H(c) (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group H(a) (quartet).\n        *   **1.6 (3H, d):** Methyl protons H(a). It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent proton, H(b).\n    *   The provided data is perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
