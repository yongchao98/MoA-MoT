    "In the context of a synthetic organic chemistry lab, chemists frequently use purification techniques to separate the desired product from unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and other impurities. The most common of these techniques is chromatography, particularly Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) for quick analysis and column chromatography for large-scale purification.\n\nChromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (often a polar material like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). The separation is primarily driven by the difference in polarity between the compounds in the mixture.\n\n*   A compound's polarity determines how strongly it adsorbs (sticks) to the polar stationary phase.\n*   Highly polar compounds stick strongly and move slowly.\n*   Less polar compounds stick weakly and are carried along more quickly by the mobile phase.\n\nThe phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common idiom used by chemists to describe the result of a failed chromatographic separation. On a TLC plate, this would mean the spots for the different compounds have traveled the same distance and appear as a single, unresolved spot. In column chromatography, it means the different compounds elute from the column at the same time, resulting in overlapping peaks on a chromatogram and a mixed collection of fractions.\n\nThis lack of separation occurs when the compounds in the mixture have very similar polarities. Because their polarities are nearly identical, they interact with the stationary and mobile phases in the same way and therefore cannot be resolved.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) Similar boiling points would be a problem for separation by *distillation*, not typically described as being \"on top of each other.\"\nB) Non-covalent interactions are the underlying physical reason for properties like polarity and boiling point, but \"similar polarity\" is the direct property that causes a failed chromatographic separation.\nD) Optical rotation is an analytical property of chiral molecules and is not a separation technique. The phrase doesn't relate to a measurement from a polarimeter.\n\nTherefore, the statement most directly refers to a failed chromatographic separation due to the compounds having similar polarities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
