    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to the carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reactants and products:**\n    *   Reactant: Butan-2-one (CH₃COCH₂CH₃)\n    *   Reagent: Sodium cyanide (NaCN), which provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻). The cyanide ion is the nucleophile.\n    *   Product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃). A new C-C bond is formed, and the carbonyl oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\n3.  **Determine the mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   To get the final hydroxyl group (-OH) in the product, this negatively charged oxygen atom must be protonated. This requires a source of protons (H⁺).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the role of reagent A:** Reagent A must be the proton source. In an aqueous context, a source of protons is represented by the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺. This signifies an acidic environment. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n5.  **Eliminate options based on A:** Based on this conclusion, we can eliminate options A and D, as they suggest A = NaHSO₃. We are left with options B and C.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reactants and products:**\n    *   Reactant: A cyanohydrin derivative which contains a nitrile functional group.\n    *   Product: The corresponding α-hydroxy carboxylic acid. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   The transformation is R-CN → R-COOH.\n\n3.  **Determine the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The problem specifies that reagent B is used with water (H₂O), indicating an aqueous hydrolysis.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-CN + H₂O + OH⁻ → R-COO⁻ + NH₃. This would require a subsequent acidification step to get the final R-COOH product.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the role of reagent B:** Since the product is the carboxylic acid (R-COOH) and not the carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻), an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is the most direct pathway shown. We must choose between the remaining options for B: CH₃COOH (acetic acid) and HCl (hydrochloric acid).\n    *   **HCl** is a strong mineral acid. It is a very common and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   **CH₃COOH** is a weak organic acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it is much less effective and would require significantly more forcing conditions (higher temperature, longer time) than a strong acid like HCl. In the context of standard textbook reactions, a strong acid is the expected reagent.\n\n5.  **Select the best reagent for B:** Given the choice between a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid (CH₃COOH) for a complete hydrolysis, the strong acid is the more appropriate and conventional choice. Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction 1, the reagent A is a proton source, best represented as **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For Reaction 2, the reagent B is a strong acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis, which is **HCl**.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
