    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents points towards an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. While the typical Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3, other methods can achieve this. The acidic proton is on the α-carbon (the methyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction replaces one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n    *   Product 1 is **bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the bromine atom is attached to a primary carbon, which is an excellent substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with *excess* sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential alkylation and cyclization reaction.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes the most acidic proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The protons on the α-carbon (the CH2 group) are highly acidic because the negative charge of the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano group and the carbonyl group.\n        *   NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting nucleophilic carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        *   [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic α-proton, which is removed by the excess base.\n        *   NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion is positioned to attack the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a cyclic compound. The ring is formed from the α-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group.\n    *   Product 4 is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:**\n    ```\n          COOEt\n         /\n    C1 -- CN\n   /  \\\n  C2--C6\n /    \\\nC3----C5\n  \\  /\n   C4\n    ```\n    At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This results in a time-averaged structure that possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the C-O-O part of the ester group. This symmetry plane makes the two halves of the ring equivalent.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-) are rendered chemically equivalent (enantiotopic) by the plane of symmetry. They will appear as a single signal in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 total):**\n        *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n        *   **Protons at C2 and C6:** The two protons on any single methylene carbon in the ring (e.g., C2) are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because of their fixed spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Even with rapid ring flipping, their averaged environments are different. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the 4 protons at these positions will give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons at C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. The 4 protons at the equivalent C3 and C5 positions are divided into two sets of diastereotopic protons. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Protons at C4:** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons attached to it are on opposite faces of the ring and are diastereotopic with respect to the rest of the molecule. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 1 (for CH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From ring C2/C6: 2 signals\n    *   From ring C3/C5: 2 signals\n    *   From ring C4: 2 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 signals.**\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
