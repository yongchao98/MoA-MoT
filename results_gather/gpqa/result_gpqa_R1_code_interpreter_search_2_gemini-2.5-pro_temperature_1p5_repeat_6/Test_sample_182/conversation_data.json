    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation, is calculated based on rings and multiple bonds.\n\n*   **Cyclohex... ring:** A cyclic structure contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **...-3-ene:** A carbon-carbon double bond within the ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **...carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **2-formyl (-CHO):** This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **5-vinyl (-CH=CH2):** This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond, which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Total IHD of the reactant** = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (COOH C=O) + 1 (CHO C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **5**.\n\nWe can also determine the molecular formula of the reactant to verify this:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in vinyl) = 10.\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure. This gives C10H12O3.\n*   IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2. (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our initial count.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess of hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is an extremely powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key characteristics are:\n*   It reduces carbonyl groups (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes (CHx groups). For example, -COOH and -CHO are both reduced to -CH3.\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon multiple bonds (double and triple bonds) to single bonds (saturates them).\n*   It effectively removes all functional groups containing oxygen and all C-C multiple bonds, converting the molecule into its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the reducing action of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The **C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring** is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The **C=C double bond in the vinyl group** is reduced, converting the vinyl group to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains intact. The product will be a saturated cycloalkane with substituents. The original 10-carbon skeleton becomes a substituted cyclohexane. The product is **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\nThe molecular formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is **CnH2n**. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nNow we calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the final product, C10H20.\n\nUsing the formula IHD = C + 1 - H/2:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - 20/2\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is fully saturated (no double or triple bonds). The only feature contributing to the IHD is the single ring structure.\n*   IHD from rings = 1\n*   IHD from multiple bonds = 0\n*   **Total IHD of the product = 1**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
