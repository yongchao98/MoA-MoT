    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A point charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the entire conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If we imagine a Gaussian surface that encloses the cavity but lies entirely within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero everywhere on this surface (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner wall of the cavity must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` charge placed inside.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to conserve the total charge.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage):** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges placed inside it. The combined electric field produced by the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity wall is zero for all points outside the cavity. This means the specific location of the charge `+q` within the cavity and the location of the cavity itself do not influence the electric field outside the main conductor.\n\n4.  **Field Due to the Outer Charge:** The electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, is therefore determined *only* by the charge distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor. Since this outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges nearby, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = O.\n    *   Distance of the point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Formula:** The magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    Substituting the values from our analysis:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The various other distances and angles provided in the problem (`r`, `s`, `l`, `Î¸`) are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. They are distractors. The correct answer depends only on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
