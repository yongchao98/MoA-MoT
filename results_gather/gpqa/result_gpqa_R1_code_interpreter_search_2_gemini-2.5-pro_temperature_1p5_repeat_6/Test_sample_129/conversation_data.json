    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the *minimum* redshift (`z`) that allows the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption line from a hydrogen cloud to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information and Constraints:**\n    *   **Spectral Line:** Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (λ₀):** The problem gives this as ~1216 Ångströms. This is the wavelength at which the absorption occurs in the cloud's own reference frame.\n    *   **Detection Method:** Ground-based optical telescopes. This is the crucial constraint.\n    *   **Physical Principle of Redshift:** The expansion of the universe stretches the wavelength of light. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest wavelength (λ₀) and the redshift (z) by the formula: `λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Constraint:** Why can't ground-based telescopes see all wavelengths? The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to certain wavelengths. Specifically, it absorbs most radiation in the Ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum, primarily due to the ozone layer. The atmosphere only becomes transparent in the \"optical window,\" which starts at the edge of the UV.\n\n4.  **Determine the Atmospheric Cutoff Wavelength:** To find the *minimum* redshift, we need to find the *minimum* observed wavelength that can reach a ground-based telescope. This corresponds to the boundary between the UV and the visible spectrum. This atmospheric cutoff is not a perfectly sharp line, but it is generally accepted to be around 3200 to 3600 Ångströms (320 to 360 nm). Light with wavelengths shorter than this is strongly absorbed. For an observation to be feasible, the redshifted Lyα line must have a wavelength `λ_obs` that is greater than this cutoff.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   We want to find the minimum `z`.\n    *   This corresponds to the minimum `λ_obs`.\n    *   The minimum `λ_obs` is the atmospheric cutoff wavelength, let's call it `λ_cutoff`.\n    *   So, we set `λ_obs = λ_cutoff`.\n    *   The redshift formula is `λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z)`.\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `z`:\n        *   `(1 + z) = λ_obs / λ₀`\n        *   `z = (λ_obs / λ₀) - 1`\n    *   To find the lower limit on `z`, we use the cutoff wavelength for `λ_obs`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Let's use a typical value for the atmospheric cutoff, for example, 3500 Å. This is a common and realistic value for where observations start to become practical.\n    *   `λ₀ = 1216 Å`\n    *   `λ_cutoff ≈ 3500 Å`\n    *   `z = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n\n    Now, let's use a Python script to get a precise value.\n    ```python\n    # Rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\n    lambda_rest = 1216\n    \n    # The approximate atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes.\n    # Light below this wavelength (in the UV) is absorbed by the atmosphere.\n    # A typical value for where the optical window begins is around 3500-3600 Angstroms.\n    # Let's check which of the multiple-choice answers corresponds to a reasonable cutoff.\n    \n    # Options for redshift (z)\n    options = {'A': 3, 'B': 1.2, 'C': 1.9, 'D': 2.4}\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the required observed wavelength for each redshift option:\")\n    \n    for key, z in options.items():\n        # Formula: lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z)\n        lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z)\n        print(f\"For redshift z = {z} ({key}), the observed wavelength is {lambda_observed:.1f} Angstroms.\")\n    \n    # Reasoning based on the output:\n    # A redshift of 1.2 results in a wavelength of ~2675 A, which is deep in the UV and completely blocked by the atmosphere.\n    # A redshift of 1.9 results in a wavelength of ~3526 A. This is right at the edge of the atmospheric window (typically quoted as starting around 320-360 nm, or 3200-3600 A). This is a very plausible lower limit for detection.\n    # Redshifts of 2.4 and 3.0 result in wavelengths well within the visible spectrum (~4134 A and ~4864 A), so they are easily detectable. However, the question asks for the *lower limit*.\n    # Therefore, z=1.9 is the best answer for the lower limit.\n    ```\n\n7.  **Interpret the Results:**\n    *   `z = 1.2` gives `λ_obs = 2675 Å`. This is firmly in the UV and would be blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   `z = 1.9` gives `λ_obs = 3526 Å`. This wavelength is just entering the region where the atmosphere becomes transparent (the \"optical window\"). This makes it an excellent candidate for the *lower limit*.\n    *   `z = 2.4` gives `λ_obs = 4134 Å`. This is violet light, easily observable from the ground, but it's not the *minimum* required redshift.\n    *   `z = 3.0` gives `λ_obs = 4864 Å`. This is blue-green light, also easily observable.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The lowest redshift from the options that shifts the 1216 Å line into the observable optical window is z = 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
