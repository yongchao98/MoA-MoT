    "*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the mass of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This 100:32 ratio is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n    *   The molecular formula for all the options is C₇H₅ClO₂. Let's verify the mass:\n        *   Mass with ³⁵Cl = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu. This matches the M+ peak.\n        *   Mass with ³⁷Cl = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 37 + 32 = 158 amu. This matches the M+2 peak.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and contains one chlorine atom. All options fit this criterion.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded in a dimeric form.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically one belonging to an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates option (B) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride) and option (C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (a phenol and aldehyde). We are now left with options (A) and (D).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The signal at **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is a singlet that integrates to one proton. Its chemical shift is far downfield, which is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This further confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region contains two signals: a doublet at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and a doublet at **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**. This specific pattern, two doublets each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Let's compare this pattern to the remaining options:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is para-substituted. It has two sets of chemically equivalent protons on the benzene ring, which would give exactly two doublets, each representing 2 protons. This perfectly matches the NMR data.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is ortho-substituted. The four protons on the ring are all in different chemical environments. This would lead to a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct signals, not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal confirm the carboxylic acid group. The aromatic region of the NMR confirms the para-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
