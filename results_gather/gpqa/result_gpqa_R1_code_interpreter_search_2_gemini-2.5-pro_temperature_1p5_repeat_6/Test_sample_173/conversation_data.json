    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Mass = M\n    *   Rest-mass energy = `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum = 0.\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, let's call them fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive).\n    *   Let their rest masses be `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   We are given `m1` is \"2 times more massive\" than `m2`. This is interpreted as `m1 = 2 * m2`. We'll see if the options support this interpretation.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments will have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### **2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = 0`\n    *   This means the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `M * c^2 = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n    *   The total kinetic energy released (also known as the Q-value of the reaction) is `Q = T1 + T2`.\n    *   `Q = M * c^2 - (m1 + m2) * c^2`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   First, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments. We are given:\n    1.  `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M * c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    2.  `m1 * c^2 = 2 * (m2 * c^2)`.\n\n*   Substitute (2) into (1):\n    *   `2 * (m2 * c^2) + (m2 * c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    *   `3 * (m2 * c^2) = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m2 * c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1 * c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n*   Now, calculate the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n    *   `Q = M * c^2 - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate Kinetic Energy T1 (Relativistic)**\n\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Rearranging, we get `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since `E = T + m*c^2`, this becomes:\n    *   `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1^2 = p2^2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   We also know `T1 + T2 = Q`, so `T2 = Q - T1`. Substitute this into the equation:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2) - 2*T1*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Cancel the `T1^2` terms and group `T1` terms:\n    *   `2*T1*(m1*c^2) + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*(m2*c^2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2)`\n    *   `T1 * [2 * (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + 2*Q] = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + Q = (M*c^2) = 300 GeV`. So, `[2 * (297) + 2*3] = [594 + 6] = 600`.\n*   `T1 * [2 * M*c^2] = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n*   `T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * M*c^2)`\n*   Plug in the values (all in GeV):\n    *   `T1 = (3 * (3 + 2*99)) / (2 * 300)`\n    *   `T1 = (3 * (3 + 198)) / 600`\n    *   `T1 = (3 * 201) / 600`\n    *   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy `T1` is **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### **5. Calculate Kinetic Energy T1 (Classical Approximation)**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2*m)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2 = p`.\n    *   `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical`\n    *   `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n*   Therefore, `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`:\n    *   `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n    *   `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   The total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n*   So, the classical approximation for `T1` is **1 GeV**.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = `T1` (correct) - `T1` (classical)\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We know `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Total rest-mass energy of the two fragments\nm_total_c2 = 0.99 * M_c2\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy released)\nQ = M_c2 - m_total_c2\n\n# Individual rest-mass energies\n# We have m1 + m2 = m_total and m1 = 2*m2\n# So, (2*m2 + m2)*c^2 = m_total_c2\n# 3*m2*c^2 = m_total_c2\nm2_c2 = m_total_c2 / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment)\n# From conservation of momentum p1=p2: T1^2 + 2*T1*m1_c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2_c2\n# With T2 = Q - T1, we derived: T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2_c2)) / (2 * M_c2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2_c2)) / (2 * M_c2)\n\n# Classical approximation for T1\n# From conservation of momentum p1=p2: m1*T1_cl = m2*T2_cl\n# With T1_cl + T2_cl = Q and m1=2*m2, we get T1_cl = Q/3\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# The difference in GeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV} MeV.\")\n```\n> The difference is 5.0 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy `E₀ = M * c² = 300 GeV` is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments, with rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\n### **1. Determine the Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Total Energy `E_initial = M * c² = 300 GeV`\n    *   Initial Momentum `p_initial = 0`\n\n*   **Mass Relationship:**\n    *   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n*   **Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of Fragments:**\n    *   Multiplying by `c²`, we get `(m₁ * c²) + (m₂ * c²) = 0.99 * (M * c²)`.\n    *   `(m₁ * c²) + (m₂ * c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Since `m₁ = 2 * m₂`, we also have `(m₁ * c²) = 2 * (m₂ * c²)`.\n    *   Substitute this into the sum: `2 * (m₂ * c²) + (m₂ * c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `3 * (m₂ * c²) = 297 GeV` => `m₂ * c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Therefore, `m₁ * c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n*   **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The total energy is conserved. The initial energy `M*c²` is converted into the rest-mass energy and kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁ * c² + m₂ * c²)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Kinetic Energy T₁ (Relativistic - Correct Method)**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The total energy of a particle is `E = T + m*c²`. The relation is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   Rearranging gives `(p*c)² = E² - (m*c²)² = (T + m*c²)² - (m*c²)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c²)`.\n    *   Since the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²`.\n    *   `T₁² + 2*T₁*(m₁*c²) = T₂² + 2*T₂*(m₂*c²)`.\n\n*   **Solve for T₁:**\n    *   We know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    *   Substitute the values (all in GeV):\n        `T₁² + 2*T₁*(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2*(3 - T₁)*(99)`\n        `T₁² + 396*T₁ = (9 - 6*T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198*T₁)`\n    *   Cancel the `T₁²` terms from both sides:\n        `396*T₁ = 9 - 6*T₁ + 594 - 198*T₁`\n        `396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁`\n    *   Group the `T₁` terms:\n        `396*T₁ + 204*T₁ = 603`\n        `600*T₁ = 603`\n        `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### **3. Calculate Kinetic Energy T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy & Momentum:**\n    *   `T_cl = p²/ (2*m)`.\n    *   From momentum conservation `p₁ = p₂ = p`, so `p² = 2*m₁*T₁_cl = 2*m₂*T₂_cl`.\n    *   `m₁*T₁_cl = m₂*T₂_cl`.\n\n*   **Solve for T₁_cl:**\n    *   Using the mass ratio `m₁ = 2*m₂`: `2*m₂*T₁_cl = m₂*T₂_cl` => `T₂_cl = 2*T₁_cl`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is still `Q = T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T₁_cl = 1 GeV`.\n    *   This is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using the classical approximation.\n\n### **4. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = (Correct T₁) - (Classical T₁)\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
