    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it has a C2 axis of rotation and a center of inversion.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. When mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, it can attack from the top face or the bottom face. Since the starting alkene is achiral, these two modes of attack produce a pair of enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This results in a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-addition.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of a *syn*-epoxidation followed by an *anti*-ring-opening is equivalent to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide via backside attack at either C4 or C5 results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a *meso* compound (it has a center of inversion).\n    *   Similarly, opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide results in the same *meso* compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral compound: *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene is that it results in a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify: Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA (a *syn*-addition) produces the *cis*-epoxide, which is a *meso* compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening (*anti*-addition) involves water attacking the two epoxide carbons. These two carbons (C4 and C5) are enantiotopic. Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) with inversion of stereochemistry leads to the (4S,5S)-diol. Attack at the other carbon (C5) leads to the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since the attacking nucleophile (water) is achiral and the substrate (*meso*-epoxide) is achiral, attack at the two enantiotopic centers occurs at an equal rate.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct compounds:\n1.  *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three compounds are stereoisomers. The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**4. Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, an achiral column **cannot** separate the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties. Therefore, the achiral column **can** separate the *meso*-diol from the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the *meso*-diol and one for the co-eluting racemic pair.\n\n**5. Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment inside the column.\n*   In a chiral environment, enantiomers can interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. A chiral column is designed to separate enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, the chiral column will separate the (4R,5R)-diol from the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   It will also separate the *meso*-diol from the other two, as diastereomers are always separable.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will show **three peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
