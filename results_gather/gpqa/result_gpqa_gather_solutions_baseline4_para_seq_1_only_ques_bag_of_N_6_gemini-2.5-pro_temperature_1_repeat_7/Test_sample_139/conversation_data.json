The D₂ molecule has 2p and 2n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7p and 7n. The N₂ molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (Oxygen gas): Each ¹⁶O atom has 8p and 8n. The O₂ molecule has 16p and 16n. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. The CO molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): H has 1p, 0n. D has 1p, 1n. The HD molecule has 2p and 1n. This does not fit.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G forms. Heating G releases substance B, which has a melting point near 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This value is remarkably close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly implies that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Connecting the clues:** If heating G releases D₂O (B), then G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, a compound that loses D₂O upon heating (a process similar to dehydration). The fact that D₂O is a product points to Deuterium being a key component of the system. This also supports D₂ as the identity of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We need a substance (X) containing Deuterium that reacts to form a deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W).\n    *   **Clue 6: The organic chemistry connection.** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. A very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both groups to alcohols (-OH). The product would be a diol, CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **The violent reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts extremely violently with water. Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (s) + 4 D₂O (l) → LiOD (aq) + Al(OD)₃ (s)↓ + 4 D₂ (g)↑`\n        *   This reaction is violent.\n        *   Gas W = D₂. As established, it has an equal number of protons and neutrons (2p, 2n). This fits.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Decomposition of G:** Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose.\n        *   Reaction: `2 Al(OD)₃ (s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ (s) + 3 D₂O (g)`\n        *   This reaction releases substance B = D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. This fits.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic number (Z) = 1  **(Lightest)**\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminium (Al): Z = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, Al = ²⁷Al).\n        *   **Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of the stable isotope of Al is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n        This points towards a compound used in isotopic labeling studies, often to trace reaction mechanisms. Deuterium (D or ²H), a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is very commonly used for this purpose.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        Let's analyze potential gases (W) with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has p=2, n=2. This is a perfect fit, especially given the \"heavier isotope\" clue.\n        *   **N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** The common ¹⁴N isotope has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has p=14, n=14. This is a possibility.\n        *   **Other possibilities** like CO, ¹⁸O₂, etc., are less likely in the context of a simple, violent reaction.\n        The most plausible candidate for W is D₂ gas, which strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuterated compound (contains Deuterium). A violent reaction that produces a gas often involves a highly reactive substance with a protic solvent like water. If X is a deuteride and it produces D₂ gas, the other source of deuterium atoms must be the liquid Y. Therefore, **Liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n    *   **Let's propose a candidate for X.** A very common deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is the deuterated analog of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) against the clues.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.**\n        The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O.\n        The products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and **Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, which is insoluble and would form a precipitate (G). This fits the clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.**\n        Heating metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) often causes dehydration (or its equivalent).\n        Heating G (Al(OD)₃): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)\n        So, the released substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. To convert to Kelvin: 273.15 + 3.82 = **276.97 K**. This value is indeed very close to 277 K. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: >C=O → >CD(OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n        So, the entire keto acid molecule is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). A diol contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is perfectly consistent.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.**\n        X is LiAlD₄. Its very close analog is **LiAlH₄**. Both are cornerstone reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X (LiAlD₄):** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Interpret the calculation instruction:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        This means we must:\n        1.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen).\n        2.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium).\n        3.  Sum these two totals.\n    *   **Perform the calculation using integer mass numbers (as the options are integers):**\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **4** deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   The main isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **1** aluminium atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B and identify G.**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical decomposition reaction for a hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide. Given that a precipitate (G) is formed in the initial reaction, G is likely a metal deuteroxide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1 & 10: The nature of Substance X.**\n    Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This, combined with the presence of deuterium, points towards common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs (LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄) are staples in organic chemistry.\n\n4.  **Propose identities for X, Y, W, and G and test the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlD₄ is known to react violently with water and similar protic solvents.\n    *   **Formation of gas W:** Clue 3 states that gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4HD. The gas is HD (Hydrogen Deuteride). Let's check its composition: Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. So, Y is not H₂O.\n        *   What if liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)? The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n        *   Let's check the gas W = D₂ (Deuterium gas). Composition: Protons = 1 + 1 = 2. Neutrons = 1 + 1 = 2. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **Formation of precipitate G:** In this reaction, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so it's certain that Al(OD)₃ would be a precipitate as well. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This also fits.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Clue 9: The reaction with a keto acid.**\n    A keto acid has both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols (hydroxyl groups, -OH).\n    *   Ketone reduction: R-CO-R' → R-CD(OH)-R'\n    *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n    The final product would be a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups), for example, HO-CD₂-R'-CD(OH)-R. This molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The molecule contains one atom of aluminium. The mass number of the most stable isotope of aluminium (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Final Sum:** Sum of the two cumulative masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances involved.**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W.** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): D is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely to be formed in the context of the other clues)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O). (Fits)\n\n    *   **Clue 2: The reaction.** \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". The release of D₂ gas strongly suggests a reaction between a deuterated reducing agent (a metal deuteride) and a proton/deuteron source like water or heavy water.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Substance B.** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance G.** Since heating the precipitate G releases D₂O (B), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (the deuterated analog of a metal hydroxide), which decomposes upon heating. For example, M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n2.  **Propose a candidate for Substance X.**\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The organic chemistry context.** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and its analog, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), are extremely common and powerful reducing agents. NaBD₄/NaBH₄ is another pair.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is famous for reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH). A keto acid contains both functional groups. The reduction of a keto acid (like pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH) with LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) followed by workup yields a diol (like 1,2-propanediol, CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ as Substance X. The reaction would be with heavy water (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. (Checks out)\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate. (Checks out)\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. (Checks out)\n    *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   The organic chemistry reaction with a keto acid makes sense. (Checks out)\n\n    All clues point strongly to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" implies we sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements within the molecule's formula. We will use the integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Mass from lightest element) + (Mass from heaviest element)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substances X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze common gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   Other gases like N₂ (14p, 14n), O₂ (16p, 16n), CO (14p, 14n) also fit this criterion, but the clue about a \"heavier isotope\" strongly points towards Deuterium (D). So, we can hypothesize **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Substance X and Reaction:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" which we now suspect is Deuterium (D). It reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen (or its isotope) is the reaction of a hydride with water.\n        *   The phrase \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n        *   The \"close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n        *   To produce pure D₂ gas from LiAlD₄, the other reactant (liquid Y) must also be a source of deuterium atoms. The most common liquid that fits this is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O. It produces D₂ gas (W). So, we can tentatively identify **Y = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces a precipitate G. In the products `LiOD + Al(OD)₃`, LiOD is soluble, but Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, is insoluble, just like its analog Al(OH)₃.\n        *   G (Al(OD)₃) is heated and releases B. When Al(OH)₃ is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OH)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`.\n        *   By analogy, `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So, substance **B = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   The problem states the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let's convert this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The actual melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong confirmation of our identifications.\n\n    *   **Confirmation with the Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) -> Secondary alcohol (>CHOH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains a total of 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue perfectly and rules out milder reagents like NaBD₄ (which wouldn't reduce the carboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X.**\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently conclude that **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation.**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number and mass): Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number and mass): Aluminium (Al).\n\n    *   **Interpret the Calculation Instructions:** The question includes a critical clause: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        *   This clause tells us how to calculate the mass contribution for each element.\n        *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are **four instances** in the formula LiAlD₄. Therefore, we must sum the masses of all four Deuterium atoms.\n        *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is only **one instance**.\n\n    *   **Calculate:** We will use integer mass numbers, as the options are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the main isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × (mass of a D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × (mass of an Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n        *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling, common in chemistry, often involving deuterium (D, or ²H) as a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 2: Melting point of B is ~277 K.** The Kelvin scale is used. 277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This implies that G is a deuterated hydrate, most likely a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₓ), which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** The reaction is violent and produces a gas, which is characteristic of reactive hydrides/deuterides with a protic substance like water.\n    *   **Clue 5: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's consider some simple gases.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Yes.**\n        *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. No.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible, but less likely from the context.\n        Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible gas is D₂.\n    *   **Clue 6: Reconstructing the reaction.** If the gas W is D₂, it must be formed from a reaction involving deuterium. A simple way to produce D₂ is to react a deuteride (a compound containing D⁻ ions or polarized D atoms) with a deuterium source like heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n        The reaction would be: `Substance X (a deuteride) + D₂O (liquid Y) -> D₂ (gas W) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate G)`. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying Substance X.** We have two more clues for X.\n        *   \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly points to common reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. Both are common reagents.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) reduce both functional groups to alcohols. A ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OH), and a carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂-OH). The starting keto acid has two oxygen atoms, and the resulting product, a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), also has two oxygen atoms. This reaction works with LiAlD₄ but not with weaker hydrides.\n    *   **Conclusion for X:** All clues converge on **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   It contains a heavy isotope (D).\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a major organic reagent.\n        *   It reacts violently with D₂O (Y) to produce D₂ (W) and Al(OD)₃ (part of G). `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G.\n        *   Heating Al(OD)₃ gives Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n        *   It reduces a keto acid to a diol, preserving the number of oxygen atoms (two).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We compare the elements by atomic number or atomic mass to find the lightest and heaviest.\n        *   Li: Z=3, Mass ≈ 7 amu\n        *   Al: Z=13, Mass ≈ 27 amu\n        *   D (isotope of H): Z=1, Mass ≈ 2 amu\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to calculate the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D = ²H (mass = 2) and Al = ²⁷Al (mass = 27).\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are four D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = Mass from Al + Mass from D = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Isotope:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the heavy isotope involved is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W is released from a reaction involving deuterium. The clue states its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   A Deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release D₂ (gas W) and form a precipitate G. Since deuterium is involved, it is highly probable that liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is `X + D₂O → D₂ + G`. This is characteristic of a metal deuteride reacting with heavy water, analogous to a metal hydride reacting with normal water (e.g., `NaH + H₂O → H₂ + NaOH`).\n    *   The precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a metal deuteroxide, as heating a metal hydroxide often yields a metal oxide and water. For example, `Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + D₂O`.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with only 2 oxygens, a powerful reduction must occur, converting both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohol groups (`R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`).\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common, powerful reducing agent. The most famous one is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The deuterated analog of LiAlH₄ is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits all the criteria:\n        *   It contains the heavy isotope Deuterium.\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a staple in organic chemistry.\n        *   It is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol.\n        *   Its reaction with heavy water is violent: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`. Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a precipitate.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (`Al(OD)₃`) releases D₂O (B).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom). The mass of one aluminum atom is approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass** = (Total mass from Al) + (Total mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35 amu.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe step-by-step thinking process has led to the identification of the substances and the final calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is ~3.85 °C. This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, indicating that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance Y, G, and the Reaction Type:** Since B (D₂O) is produced by heating a precipitate G, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating. G is formed in a reaction between substance X and a liquid Y. Given that all products contain deuterium, the liquid reactant **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is violent, suggesting X is a highly reactive substance.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released from the reaction and its molecules have an equal number of neutrons and protons. The reaction is between a deuterated substance X and D₂O. The most plausible gaseous product is a form of hydrogen.\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Unequal)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We now know that X reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate (G). This is the characteristic reaction of a metal deuteride.\n    *   `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`\n    *   The clue about organic chemistry provides the final piece. \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. Reducing it to a product with 2 oxygens requires reducing the carboxylic acid group, a reaction that needs a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent. Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope (deuterium) is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`. This matches all observations: it's a violent reaction, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G), which upon heating gives D₂O (B).\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass:** The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. It contains one Aluminum atom and four Deuterium atoms.\n    *   We use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum atom (²⁷Al) = 27 u.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium atom (²H) = 2 u.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.** This immediately suggests isotopic labeling. A very common example in chemistry is replacing Hydrogen (H, protium) with its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas): The most common isotope, ¹⁴N, has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This also fits.\n        *   CO (Carbon Monoxide): Using common isotopes ¹²C (6p, 6n) and ¹⁶O (8p, 8n), a CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This also fits.\n        The D₂ option seems most promising because it aligns with Clue 1.\n    *   **Clue 4, 5, & 6: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   The proximity of B's melting point to that of D₂O is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   **Connecting the dots so far:** If B is D₂O, then G must be a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide like M(OD)ₓ decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. If B is D₂O and W is D₂, it strongly reinforces the idea that Substance X is a deuterated compound.\n    *   **Clue 7 & 8: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.**\n        *   A keto acid has two functional groups containing oxygen: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This can happen if the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        *   The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very powerful reducing agent. The most common one in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a \"heavier isotope\" would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Let's check this hypothesis: LiAlD₄ reduces a keto acid (R-CO-R'-COOH) to a diol (R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH). The final product has two oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly. NaBH₄ (and NaBD₄) is another common reducing agent, but it's not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, so it's not a candidate.\n\n2.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Let's assume **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a common reagent.

Decoding the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, this means heating the precipitate G releases D₂O. This is characteristic of a deuterated hydrate, most likely a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   For example: M(OD)n --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms.\"**\n    *   We know the reaction involves deuterium (from D₂O). This makes it highly likely that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is deuterium (D).\n    *   Let's analyze possible candidates for gas W (equal protons and neutrons):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Protons = 1+1=2; Neutrons = 1+1=2. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Protons = 7+7=14; Neutrons = 7+7=14. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): Protons = 6+8=14; Neutrons = 6+8=14. This fits.\n    *   Considering the context (D₂O is produced), a reaction producing D₂ gas is the most logical choice for W.\n    *   The overall reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate). Since G is a metal deuteroxide and D₂ is produced, a plausible reaction is the violent reaction of a metal deuteride (X) with heavy water (Y).\n    *   Reaction scheme: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W).\n    *   For a precipitate (G) to form, the metal deuteroxide must be insoluble. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a known gelatinous precipitate. This suggests that Substance X contains aluminum.\n    *   A common and powerful deuteride reagent containing aluminum is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verifying LiAlD₄ with the remaining clues.**\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) reacts with D₂O (Y).\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W)`\n    *   This reaction is notoriously violent. It produces D₂ gas (W), which has equal protons and neutrons. It forms a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G). Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This hypothesis fits all the chemical reaction clues perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group (3 oxygen atoms in total).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups.\n        *   Ketone reduction: -C(=O)- → -CD(OH)-\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CH₂OH\n        *   So, the keto acid R-C(=O)-COOH is reduced to the diol R-CD(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product contains two hydroxyl (-OH) groups, and therefore **2 oxygen atoms**.

We will use integer masses (mass numbers) as the options are integers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula contains four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The formula contains one atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its most stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n*   **Calculate the final sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W's Properties:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple gaseous molecules.\n        *   Hydrogen (H2): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   Nitrogen (N2): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible.\n        *   Deuterium (D2): Deuterium (D) is a heavy isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D2 molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   This clue strongly suggests the involvement of Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and Isotopes:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". This aligns perfectly with the idea that Gas W is D2, meaning Substance X contains Deuterium (D).\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X and Y:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". A classic violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Since D2 is produced, a plausible scenario is a metal deuteride (Substance X) reacting with water (Liquid Y). A very powerful reagent that fits this description is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4). Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   Proposed X = LiAlD4\n        *   Proposed Y = H2O (a common liquid)\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD4 + 4H2O → LiOH + Al(OH)3 + 4D2\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent, produces D2 gas (our identified Gas W), and proceeds with water (a liquid, Y).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Precipitate G and Substance B:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   In our proposed reaction (LiAlD4 + 4H2O), Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is formed, which is a well-known white precipitate. So, **G = Al(OH)3**.\n        *   When Aluminum Hydroxide is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OH)3(s) --(heat)--> Al2O3(s) + 3H2O(g). The substance released is water, H2O. So, **B = H2O**.\n        *   The melting point of water is 0 °C, which is 273.15 K. The value 277 K (3.85 °C) is stated to be \"very close\", which confirms that B is water.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Organic Chemistry Context:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4) is a famous and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated version, LiAlD4 (our proposed Substance X), is its \"very close analog\" and is also used. This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   Keto acids contain both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). They have at least 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH4 (and LiAlD4) reduces both functional groups to alcohols: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n        *   The final product is a diol (contains two alcohol groups, -OH). A diol has exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms the chemical identity of X.\n\n2.  **Conclusion of Identification**\n\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently identify the substances:\n    *   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4)\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Water (H2O)\n    *   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D2)\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH)3)\n    *   **Substance B:** Water (H2O)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value**\n\n    The question asks to \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD4\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number or atomic mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element and Aluminum is the heaviest.\n    *   **Sum the masses as instructed:** The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we need the total mass contribution of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in one formula unit. We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved (D=2, Al=27).\n\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative (Summed) Mass:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine potential simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ⁴He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes, but unlikely product of a violent chemical reaction).\n        *   D₂O (heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O-16). (Yes).\n        *   The release of a hydrogen-like gas (D₂) is a very common pattern in reactions of active hydrides/deuterides.\n\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is extremely close to 277 K. This is a strong indicator that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Precipitate G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\".\n        *   The thermal decomposition of a substance to yield water (or in this case, heavy water) is characteristic of a hydroxide (or deuteroxide). For example, heating a metal hydroxide M(OH)ₓ produces the metal oxide and water.\n        *   Therefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating: `M(OD)x -> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B)`.\n        *   Since G is a precipitate, the metal deuteroxide must be insoluble. This rules out alkali metals like Na, K, and Li, as their hydroxides are very soluble. It suggests metals like Mg, Ca, Al, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue about the Reaction:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G\".\n        *   We have G = M(OD)ₓ. This deuteroxide is formed in the reaction. This implies that the solvent, Y, must be the source of the OD groups, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction is: `X + D₂O (Y) -> W (gas) + M(OD)x (G, precipitate)`.\n        *   If X were a simple metal, the gas released would be D₂. For example: `Ca + 2 D₂O -> Ca(OD)₂ + D₂`. This is a plausible path.\n        *   However, we have stronger clues pointing to another identity for X.\n\n    *   **Clues about Substance X:**\n        *   \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\": This is consistent with containing Deuterium (D).\n        *   \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\": This points towards a common reagent.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\": A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A product with 2 oxygen atoms suggests a reduction reaction that converts the keto acid to a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This requires a powerful reducing agent, much stronger than a simple metal like Ca.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Propose the Identity of X**\n\n    *   A very common, powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n        *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4 D₂ (gas)`\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas is D₂. As determined earlier, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The precipitate is Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a known gelatinous precipitate, so this fits.\n        *   **Heating G to get B:** Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause dehydration: `2 Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. The released substance B is D₂O.\n        *   **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into a diol, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This fits.\n        *   **Organic reagent:** LiAlH₄ is a cornerstone reagent in organic synthesis. This fits.\n\n    *   All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It clarifies to sum the masses of all atoms of those elements.\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen. In the molecule, it is present as 4 atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium. In the molecule, it is present as 1 atom of Aluminium (the most common isotope is ²⁷Al).\n    *   We will use the mass numbers for the calculation, as the answer options are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   Calculate the cumulative mass:\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative (summed) mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K, which is 4 °C. This is the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The standard water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible, but inert).\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each deuterium (D or ²H) atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n    *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n    *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Possible).\n    Given that D₂O is involved (from step 1), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is `Substance X + Liquid Y -> Gas W + Precipitate G`.\n    *   We've deduced W is likely D₂. To produce D₂ gas, both the reactant X and the liquid Y must be sources of deuterium atoms. If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction with a deuteride (like M-D) would produce HD gas (`M-D + H₂O -> M-OH + HD`), which has 2 protons and 1 neutron, not matching the properties of W.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction must be between a deuterated substance X and heavy water Y. So, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: `X (a deuteride) + D₂O -> D₂ + G`.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   X is a deuterated substance that reacts violently with D₂O.\n    *   X and its non-deuterated analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   This points towards complex metal hydrides like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is known to react *violently* with water, while NaBH₄'s reaction is much milder. The \"violent\" reaction clue strongly favors **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's check the rest of the clues with X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate G. Aluminium deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is the deuterated analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. This fits perfectly. In contrast, the product from NaBD₄ would be B(OD)₃ (deuterated boric acid), which is soluble and not a precipitate.\n    *   The precipitate G (Al(OD)₃), when heated, releases B. The decomposition is `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B (D₂O), which matches our initial finding.\n    *   The final clue is about the reaction with a keto acid. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. A keto acid (like pyruvic acid, R-CO-COOH) would be reduced to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). The product contains two oxygen atoms, which matches the clue.\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   For this type of problem, we use the mass numbers of the most common or relevant isotopes:\n        *   Deuterium (D, or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (⁷Li is the most common isotope): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminium (²⁷Al is the only stable isotope): Mass number = 27\n    *   Comparing the masses: D (2) < Li (7) < Al (27).\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium (Al)**.\n    *   The question states: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all atoms of the identified lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   4 atoms of the lightest element (D).\n        *   1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Number of D atoms × Mass of D) + (Number of Al atoms × Mass of Al)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27)\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"**: This is a strong hint towards a deuterated compound, where Deuterium (D or ²H) replaces Hydrogen (H or ¹H).\n\n    *   **\"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\"**:\n        *   Let's identify Gas W. We need a simple molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n            *   HF: H (1p, 0n) + F (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons.

(Yes)\n        *   Given the first clue about a heavier isotope, D₂ is the most likely candidate for Gas W. This implies that Substance X is a deuteride. The violent reaction suggests liquid Y is likely water (H₂O).\n\n    *   **\"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\"**: This points towards a common reagent. If X is a deuteride, a very common analog would be a hydride. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\"**:\n        *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits this clue.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-).\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n        *   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). A diol contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue strongly supports X being LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **\"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\"**:\n        *   Let's write the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with Y (H₂O):\n            `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH(aq) + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`\n        *   In this reaction, the gas W is D₂, which we already established.\n        *   A precipitate G, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃), is formed. This fits.\n        *   When precipitate G (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes:\n            `2Al(OH)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3H₂O(g)`\n        *   The reaction *releases* a substance B. So, B is water (H₂O).\n        *   The melting point of water is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. The clue states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\" (4°C). This is a reasonable approximation for a puzzle-style question (it might also be an oblique reference to the temperature of water's maximum density).\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Substance X:**\n    All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   First, identify the elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄):\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number (Z) = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number (Z) = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), represented by its isotope Deuterium (D), Atomic Number (Z) = 1\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements based on their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (Z=1)\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Z=13)\n    *   Calculate the total mass for each of these elements in the molecule using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass:\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:** The gas W released has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n        *   ²H₂ or D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). This is a strong candidate, especially given the next clue.\n        *   ⁴He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). Unlikely to be a product of a violent chemical reaction.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p=n). Possible, but less likely in this context.\n        *   The clue that \"Substance X ... incorporat[es] a heavier isotope\" strongly suggests we are dealing with deuterium (D or ²H). Therefore, **Gas W is most likely D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Thus, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Precipitate G:** Since heating G produces D₂O, G must be a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and is thermally unstable. A common example is a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O. For G to be a precipitate, the corresponding metal hydroxide must be insoluble in water. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **G is likely Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide)**.\n\n    *   **Putting it all together to identify X and Y:**\n        *   We have a reaction where Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and Al(OD)₃ precipitate.\n        *   `X + Y → D₂(g) + Al(OD)₃(s)`\n        *   For the products to contain D, Al, and O, the reactants X and Y must supply these elements. The reaction releases D₂, so X is likely a deuteride (a compound containing D⁻ ions). Since the precipitate is Al(OD)₃, X must contain aluminum. A compound containing both aluminum and deuterium is aluminum deuteride or a complex deuteride.\n        *   The most common and highly reactive reagent fitting this description is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Its reaction with heavy water (D₂O) would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD`\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and an Al(OD)₃ precipitate (G). The other product, LiOD, is soluble. This scenario perfectly fits all the clues. Thus, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify with the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" LiAlD₄ (X) and its analog LiAlH₄ are both powerful reducing agents widely used in organic synthesis. This confirms our identification.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" An α-keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone (C=O) group and the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The product is a diol, R-CD(OD)-CD₂OD (after D₂O workup), which contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This clue further solidifies that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements within the molecule.\n    *   The atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element: Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element: Hydrogen, as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Now, we sum the masses as requested:\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (H) = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X and related compounds.**\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting Point of B.** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (277 K = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), while normal water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This is a strong indication that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The heavier isotope mentioned in the first sentence is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when a precipitate G is heated. This is characteristic of the dehydration of a metal hydroxide. Since the final product is D₂O, the precipitate G must be a deuterated hydroxide, like M(OD)n. The heating reaction would be: `2 M(OD)n → M₂On + n D₂O`.\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X with Y.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and a gas W. Given that G is a deuterated hydroxide, it's formed from the reaction of a highly reactive substance X with deuterated water (D₂O). So, **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction would be: `X + D₂O → G (M(OD)n) + W (gas)`.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** The gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine the reaction `X + D₂O`. If X is a metal deuteride, the gas produced would be D₂.\n        *   Let's check D₂ (Deuterium gas): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n    *   **Clue 5: Substance X Identity.** We know X is a deuteride that reacts with D₂O to form a deuterated hydroxide and D₂ gas. We also know that X and its analog are used in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, used for isotopic labeling, is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is violent. It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), and a gas, D₂. Heating the precipitate Al(OD)₃ gives Aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). This is fully consistent with all the clues.\n    *   **Clue 6: Keto Acid Reaction.** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce a keto acid (which has a ketone group, -CO-, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH) to a hydroxy acid (e.g., R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass.**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** We compare the mass of a single atom of each element (using the mass number of the most common/relevant isotopes).\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (²H): 2 amu\n        *   Mass of Lithium (⁷Li): 7 amu\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (²⁷Al): 27 amu\n        *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Deuterium (D)** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present... considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four atoms of Deuterium in LiAlD₄. The total mass is 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum:** Summing these two values gives: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer.**\n    The calculated cumulative mass is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This strongly suggests a compound where a common element is replaced by its heavier isotope. In organic and inorganic chemistry, the most common example is the replacement of hydrogen (¹H) with deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This indicates a very reactive substance X and a protic (or in this case, deuterated) solvent Y.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released, with an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's consider simple diatomic gases.\n        *   H₂ (Protium gas): Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit).\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton, 1 neutron. D₂ molecule has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (This fits perfectly).\n        *   N₂: Each ¹⁴N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons. N₂ molecule has 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (This also fits).\n        *   However, the release of D₂ gas is much more consistent with a deuterated reagent reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   **Clue 4: The reaction is between X and liquid Y, producing gas W (D₂).** For X to produce D₂, it must be a deuteride (D⁻) donor. For Y to react and form D₂, it must be a deuterium cation (D⁺) source. The most common liquid source of D⁺ is heavy water, D₂O. The reaction would be D⁻ + D⁺ → D₂. This reaction is known to be violent for strong deuteride donors. So, let's hypothesize **Y = D₂O** and **W = D₂**.\n    *   **Clue 5: A precipitate G forms, which releases B upon heating.** Many metal hydrides react with water to form metal hydroxides, which are often insoluble (precipitates). By analogy, a metal deuteride would react with heavy water to form a metal deuteroxide. For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Many metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. So, G would be a metal deuteroxide, and upon heating, it would release heavy water (B).\n    *   **Clue 6: B has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The provided search information confirms the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B = D₂O**. This confirms our earlier hypotheses that Y is D₂O and G is a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 7: X and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.** We are looking for a powerful deuteride reducing agent whose hydride analog is very common. The two most prominent hydride reducing agents are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). LiAlH₄ is known for its extremely violent reaction with water, which fits the description well.\n    *   **Clue 8: The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group, for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) is a very strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both functional groups.\n        *   Ketone (R₂C=O) → Secondary alcohol (R₂CH-OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (R-COOH) → Primary alcohol (R-CH₂OH)\n        *   Therefore, reacting a keto acid (3 oxygens) with LiAlD₄ would reduce both groups, resulting in a diol (a compound with two alcohol groups, e.g., R-CH(OD)-CH₂(OD)). The final product contains **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and Perform Calculation:**\n    *   Based on all the evidence, Substance X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses of the specific isotopes involved. We use the mass number (protons + neutrons).\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): 1 proton + 1 neutron = Mass 2\n        *   Lithium (Li): The most abundant stable isotope is ⁷Li. Mass = 7\n        *   Aluminum (Al): The only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass = 27\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (mass 2).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (D): There are four D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of Al) + (Mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The calculated cumulative mass is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to identify the substances involved.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This is a strong hint towards isotopic labeling, most commonly with Deuterium (D or ²H), which is a heavy isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This suggests a highly exothermic reaction, typical of strong reducing agents, alkali metals, or metal hydrides with a protic substance like water.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released, and its molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes. This fits perfectly with Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes.\n        *   Given Clue 1, D₂ is the most probable candidate for gas W.\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G is formed.** The reaction produces an insoluble solid.\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B.** This means G decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 6: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 7: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has two oxygen-containing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For the final product to have only two oxygens, both groups must have been reduced to alcohols (-OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Clue 8: Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points to a common laboratory chemical.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   From Clues 3 & 6, we have identified **W = D₂** and **B = D₂O**.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is released from heating G, and the overall reaction involves deuterium, G must be a deuteroxide compound that dehydrates (or \"de-deuterates\") upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n`.\n    *   Let's test a hypothesis. The \"very close analog\" (Clue 8) of a common strong reducing agent (Clue 7) is a good starting point. The most common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope (Clue 1) would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Now, let's see if this hypothesis fits all other clues.\n        *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts extremely violently with water. So, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume **Y = D₂O**. The reaction would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes.\n        *   **Releases gas W (D₂)?** Yes.\n        *   **Forms precipitate G?** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, aluminium deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would also be a precipitate. This fits perfectly. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   **Heating G releases B (D₂O)?** The decomposition of aluminium hydroxide is `2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`. So, the decomposition of G would be `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This also fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid?** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid `R-C(=O)-COOH` would be reduced to a diol `R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`. This final product contains exactly **two oxygen atoms**. This fits Clue 7 perfectly.\n    *   The hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** is consistent with every single clue provided.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n    *   The question specifies: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This is a key instruction.\n    *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are 4 instances (four D atoms). We must sum their masses.\n    *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is 1 instance.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers (the integer sum of protons and neutrons) for the calculation, as is standard for this type of problem and because the answers are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 aluminium atom. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total cumulative mass:** Sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This points towards elements like hydrogen (Deuterium, D), carbon (¹³C), etc.\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** A violent reaction with a liquid (often water) is characteristic of highly reactive hydrides or similar compounds.\n    *   **Clue 5 & 6: G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O**, confirming that the heavy isotope from Clue 1 is Deuterium (D).\n    *   If heating G produces D₂O, then G must be a deuterated hydrate or a compound that decomposes to yield D₂O, like a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 3 Revisited: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze some potential gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1) (Yes)\n        *   N₂: 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7) (Yes)\n        *   C₂H₄: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (Yes)\n        Given that Deuterium is central to the problem, **W = D₂** is the most plausible candidate.\n    *   **Clue 8: X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This strongly suggests common laboratory reagents, very likely reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) or Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 7: The reaction product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH. Powerful reducing agents like LiAlH₄ reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reaction `R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent]` yields a diol, `R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)`. This product molecule contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction with Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. If we assume Y is D₂O (heavy water) to produce D₂ gas, the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes decomposition into the metal oxide and water. So, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases **B = D₂O**, which matches our finding from its melting point.\n    *   All clues fit perfectly with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   (Alternative check: If X were NaBD₄, the reaction `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O -> NaBO₂ + 4D₂` produces the right gas (D₂) but Sodium Metaborate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate G would form. This rules out NaBD₄).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the **cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)**. We should use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number (Z) or atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the molecule:** The formula is LiAlD₄.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is **one** atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: The Melting Point of B**\n    The substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is Deuterium (²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: Formation of B from G**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` might decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 1, 2, and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Since D₂O is a product down the line, this heavier isotope is almost certainly **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   This reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's analyze potential gases (W). Given that Deuterium is involved, let's check hydrogen isotopes:\n        *   H₂ (normal hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n        *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n        *   **D₂ (dideuterium)**: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly!)\n    *   For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, both reactants should ideally be rich in Deuterium. So, X is a deuterated compound, and Y is likely D₂O. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   We are looking for a common deuterated organic reagent that reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)- and -COOH groups, for a total of at least 3 oxygen atoms) is reduced by X to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies the reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups (e.g., R-C(=O)-R'-COOH → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH), which has two -OH groups, hence 2 oxygens).\n    *   Common reducing agents are NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄. NaBH₄ is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. LiAlH₄ (lithium aluminum hydride) is a very powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. Its analog is **LiAlD₄ (lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Heavy isotope:** Yes, it contains Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Organic reagent:** Yes, LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent, and LiAlD₄ is its well-known analog used for isotopic labeling.\n        *   **Reaction with Y = D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent.

So, G = Al(OD)₃.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum deuteroxide would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reduction:** LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce a keto acid to a diol, changing the oxygen count from 3 to 2. This fits.\n\n    All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1, present as isotope D), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄.

Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass of D) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (deuterium oxide), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This is a strong clue that we are dealing with deuterium. Normal water (H₂O) melts at 273.15 K (0 °C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine possible diatomic gases related to the context:\n    *   H₂ (molecular hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (molecular deuterium): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (p = n).\n    This confirms that the gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce pure D₂ gas, both the reagent (X) and the protic solvent it reacts with (Y) must contain only deuterium, not protium (normal hydrogen). Therefore, liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O). Substance X must be a deuterated reagent. The problem mentions X and its analog are used in organic chemistry and that the reaction is violent. This points towards a powerful deuterated reducing agent. The two most common are Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n4.  **Differentiate between LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄:** The reaction between X and Y (D₂O) forms a precipitate G. Let's write the reactions:\n    *   `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    *   `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃(s) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    Sodium borate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate forms. However, aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will precipitate. This means G is Al(OD)₃, and **Substance X must be LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify with other clues:**\n    *   **Heating G:** The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃. When heated, metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose. `2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g)`. This releases substance B, which we identified as D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   **Keto acid reaction:** The problem states \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It can reduce both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A typical α-keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH (containing 3 oxygen atoms). LiAlD₄ would reduce it to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This is also consistent.\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we must sum the mass of the single Aluminium atom and the four Deuterium atoms in the LiAlD₄ molecule.\n    *   Since the answer options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   The isotope Deuterium is ²H, with a mass number of 2.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and Liquid Y.**\n    The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n    Substance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This means G is a deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide that loses D₂O upon heating.\n    The overall reaction involves Substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and gas W. Since the products (G and B) contain deuterium (D), the liquid reactant Y must be the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\n    Gas W is released from the reaction of X and Y (D₂O). The clue is that a molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze possible gases from a reaction involving a deuteride and D₂O.\n    The reaction would produce hydrogen gas. The isotopes could be H or D.\n    *   H₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per H), 0 neutrons. Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    *   D₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Protons = Neutrons.** This fits the description.\n    *   HD molecule: 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    Therefore, **Gas W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Substance X and Precipitate G.**\n    We know that X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G.\n    X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas)\n    The clue \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The \"heavier isotope\" version would be Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    Let's test X = LiAlD₄.\n    The reaction with D₂O is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃, is the precipitate G**. This is consistent because aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O, releasing D₂O (Substance B), which matches our deductions.\n    If we tested X = NaBD₄, the products would be NaOD and B(OD)₃. Boric acid and its deuterated analog are soluble in water, so no precipitate would form. Thus, X cannot be NaBD₄.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the identity of X with the final clue.**\n    The clue states: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups to alcohols (or deuterated alcohols, \"deuterols\").\n    R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (workup) → R-CH(OD)-CD₂(OD)\n    The final product is a diol (an alcohol with two hydroxyl groups, or in this case, deuteroxyl groups). It contains **two oxygen atoms**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\n    The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must account for all atoms of hydrogen and aluminum in the formula.\n    *   We use integer atomic masses for the calculation, as the options are integers. Mass(Deuterium, D) = 2 amu. Mass(Aluminum, ²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × Mass(D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × Mass(Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Final Calculation:** The cumulative sum is the sum of these two values.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B's melting point is ~277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: The heavy isotope is Deuterium (D).** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 4: Analysis of the reaction.**\n        *   Substance X (containing D) reacts violently with liquid Y.\n        *   A precipitate G is formed.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O). This implies G is a compound that can be dehydrated (or \"de-deuterated\"), such as a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal deuteroxide M(OD)ₓ when heated would yield a metal oxide and D₂O.\n        *   For G to be a metal deuteroxide, liquid Y must be the source of the OD group, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   A gas W is released, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider the reaction between a metal deuteride (a plausible form for X) and heavy water (Y). For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Let's check the gas **W = D₂**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   So far, we know X is a substance containing a metal and deuterium. The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate).\n    *   **Clue 5: X or its analog is a reagent in organic chemistry.** The most common hydride reagents (whose deuterated analogs are also used) are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test these candidates:\n        *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. However, both sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid (B(OD)₃) are soluble in water. No precipitate (G) would form. This contradicts the clues.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate**. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 6: Heating G releases B.** If G is Al(OD)₃, heating it would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (B), which also matches the clues.\n    *   **Clue 7: The keto acid reaction.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (R-C(=O)-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) and its analog LiAlH₄ are powerful reducing agents that would reduce both functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This final clue confirms our identification.\n\n3.  **Conclusion: Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass from aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated above.\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B:**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    *   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is significantly different from that of regular water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   However, this is the characteristic melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G and B:**\n    *   The problem states that precipitate G, when heated, releases B.\n    *   Since B is D₂O, G must be a compound that contains D₂O, likely a deuterated hydrate (a \"deuterate\"), which decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A common example would be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction to identify Y and W:**\n    *   The main reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G.\n    *   Since G is a deuterated compound (M(OD)n), it's highly likely that the reactant, Liquid Y, was the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is violent: X + D₂O → W(g) + G(ppt). This suggests X is a highly reactive substance with water, like an alkali metal, a metal hydride, or a similar reactive species.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine candidates for W, assuming it's formed from X reacting with D₂O.\n        *   A likely product from such a reaction is hydrogen gas. If the reactants contain deuterium, the gas would be D₂.\n        *   Let's check D₂: A deuterium atom (D, or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂(g) and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n    *   We are also told that X, and \"especially its very close analog,\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. The \"analog\" would be the regular hydrogen version (e.g., LiAlH₄), and substance X would be its deuterated form.\n    *   Let's test **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** as Substance X. Its analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   Let's check if this fits all the clues:\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. The reaction with D₂O would be similarly violent.\n        *   **Gas W?** The reaction produces D₂, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G?** The reaction produces Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Thus, Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G releases B?** Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose into the metal oxide and water (or heavy water). `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This reaction releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with a keto acid?** A keto acid has the structure R-C(=O)-COOH and contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This crucial clue fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:**\n    All the evidence points to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n    *   The question specifies summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the formula. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, and the most stable isotope for Al, which is ²⁷Al).\n    *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen):** It is present as the isotope Deuterium (D). Its mass number is 2. There are four D atoms in the formula LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum):** It is present as the isotope ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** Sum the total masses calculated above.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong indication that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Trace the origin of B:** Substance B (D₂O) is released when a precipitate G is heated. This is a classic dehydration/de-deuteration reaction. This implies that G is a deuterated hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide, which loses D₂O upon heating. For example, a metal hydroxide M(OH)n when heated gives a metal oxide and H₂O. Similarly, M(OD)n would give a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)n**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to form the precipitate G and a gas W.\n    *   X + Y → G (precipitate) + W (gas)\n    *   Since G contains Deuterium (D), either X or Y (or both) must contain D. The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope, which we've identified as D.\n    *   A violent reaction releasing a gas and forming a hydroxide precipitate is characteristic of a reactive metal or metal hydride reacting with water.\n    *   If G is M(OD)n, then the reaction medium Y must be the source of the OD groups. This makes **liquid Y heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, produced in the reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze potential gases from the reaction of a deuterated compound (X) with heavy water (Y=D₂O).\n    *   If X were, for instance, a deuteride like CaD₂, the reaction would be CaD₂ + 2D₂O → Ca(OD)₂ + 2D₂.\n    *   Let's check the gas **D₂ (di-deuterium)**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This fits the description of W.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have gathered several clues about X:\n    *   It contains Deuterium (D).\n    *   It is a common reagent in organic chemistry, with a \"very close analog\" that is also used. This points towards pairs like LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ or NaBH₄/NaBD₄.\n    *   It reacts violently with D₂O to produce a precipitate G (a metal hydroxide) and D₂ gas.\n    *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride)**. Its analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and powerful reducing agent.\n        *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   This reaction is famously violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which we confirmed has N=P.\n        *   It produces a precipitate, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble. This fits. Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) would produce soluble sodium borate, so it's a less likely candidate.\n    *   The final clue is about the reaction with a keto acid. A keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH), containing 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ will reduce both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This clue confirms that X is a strong reducing agent.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (²H or D), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). The most common isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The cumulative (summed) mass is the sum of these two values: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X:** Contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Reacts violently. Is a reagent in organic chemistry, with a close analog.\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Reacts violently with X.\n    *   **Gas W:** Released during the reaction. A key property is that its molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Forms during the reaction.\n    *   **Substance B:** Released when G is heated. Has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of reacting a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze Gas W and Substance B:**\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K (277 - 273.15 ≈ 3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is produced by heating the precipitate G, it implies the heavy isotope present in the system is Deuterium (D).\n    *   Now let's analyze Gas W, whose molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test common diatomic gases.\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Yes, this fits.**\n        *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes, but less likely to be produced from this type of reaction.\n        *   HF: 10 protons (9 from F, 1 from H), 10 neutrons (10 from F, 0 from H). **Yes, this also fits.**\n    *   Given that the system clearly involves Deuterium (from B = D₂O), the most logical conclusion is that **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    *   The release of D₂ gas from a reaction suggests that either X or Y must be a source of deuterium.\n    *   The most common violent reactions that release hydrogen gas involve reactive metals or metal hydrides with water.\n    *   Let's propose a reaction scheme:\n        *   Scheme 1: X (a deuteride compound) + Y (H₂O). Example: CaD₂ + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + 2HD. The gas produced is HD (2p, 1n), which doesn't fit the p=n rule for gas W. So this is incorrect.\n        *   Scheme 2: X (a reactive substance) + Y (D₂O). Example: Metal + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide + D₂. This fits perfectly. The gas W is D₂, and the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    *   We also know G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing: M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O. This confirms that **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X is a substance used in organic chemistry, has a close analog, and reacts violently with D₂O to form a metal deuteroxide precipitate. This strongly points to a powerful reducing agent, specifically a complex metal hydride. The most common one that fits this description is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄, which means Substance X, containing a heavier isotope (D), must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's verify this choice against all clues:\n        *   **Heavier isotope:** Yes, Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O):** Yes. The reaction is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas). It's famously violent.\n        *   **Gas W with p=n:** Yes, D₂ is produced.\n        *   **Precipitate G forms:** Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is a gelatinous precipitate.\n        *   **G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O) on heating:** Yes. 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reaction:** A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) is reduced by LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This product contains **2 oxygen atoms**, which matches the clue.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Z(H)=1, Z(Li)=3, Z(Al)=13.\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers, as is standard for this type of problem and implied by the integer answer choices.\n        *   Mass number of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the Aluminum isotope (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   There are **four** atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as D).\n    *   Total mass from lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is **one** atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = (Total mass from lightest) + (Total mass from heaviest) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to solve the identity of Substance X.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.** This is a direct hint that we are dealing with a compound containing an isotope like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 3.85°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope Deuterium, is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an extremely strong match.\n        *   Therefore, **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n        *   This confirms the heavier isotope mentioned in Clue 1 is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This means G is a deuterated hydrate, i.e., a compound that has D₂O molecules in its structure or, more likely, a metal deuteroxide that dehydrates upon heating to form a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` would decompose upon heating: `2M(OD)n -> M₂On + nD₂O`.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Since D₂O is involved, it's highly probable that the liquid **Y is also D₂O**.\n        *   Let's analyze potential gases (W) with equal protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D has 1p and 1n. D₂ has **2p and 2n**. This is a perfect candidate.\n            *   Nitrogen gas (¹⁴N₂): Each ¹⁴N has 7p and 7n. N₂ has **14p and 14n**. This is possible.\n            *   Carbon monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. CO has **14p, 14n**. This is possible.\n        *   A reaction between an unknown substance X and D₂O that produces D₂ gas is very common for metal deuterides: `MDx + xD₂O -> M(OD)x + xD₂`. This reaction type fits the clues. The \"violently\" part suggests a very reactive deuteride.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.** In the reaction `MDx + xD₂O -> M(OD)x + xD₂`, the product **G would be the metal deuteroxide, M(OD)x**. For G to be a precipitate, M(OD)x must be insoluble in D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.** This is a huge hint. Powerful reducing agents used in organic chemistry often come in deuterated forms for isotopic labeling studies. Common examples include Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Both functional groups are reduced by strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄.\n        *   Ketone: `>C=O` is reduced to `>CH-OH`.\n        *   Carboxylic acid: `-COOH` is reduced to `-CH₂-OH`.\n        *   So, a keto acid is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). The resulting diol molecule still contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test our two main candidates, LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   **Candidate 1: LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`.\n        *   *Violent?* Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent.\n        *   *Gas W?* D₂ is produced.\n        *   *Precipitate G?* Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃.\n        *   *G → B?* Heating `2Al(OD)₃` gives `Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So B=D₂O.\n        *   *Organic Reagent?* Yes, LiAlD₄ and its analog LiAlH₄ are cornerstone reducing agents.\n        *   This is a perfect fit for all clues.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: NaBD₄ (Sodium Borodeuteride)**\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂↑`.\n        *   *Violent?* The reaction of NaBH₄ is much milder and more controllable than LiAlH₄. This doesn't fit the \"violently\" clue as well.\n        *   *Precipitate G?* The products are NaOD (soluble) and B(OD)₃ (boric acid, soluble). It does not form a classic precipitate.\n        *   Since NaBD₄ does not fit the \"violently\" and \"precipitate\" clues as well as LiAlD₄, we can confidently eliminate it.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Substance X is LiAlD₄.**\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". In puzzles of this nature, \"atomic mass\" usually refers to the integer mass number of the most common/relevant isotope.\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest:**\n        *   Hydrogen (Atomic number Z=1) is the **lightest element**.\n        *   Aluminium (Atomic number Z=13) is the **heaviest element**.\n        *   Lithium (Z=3) is an intermediate element and should be ignored based on the phrasing of the question.\n\n    *   **Calculate Masses:**\n        *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula LiAlD₄ contains 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all as the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium (1 proton + 1 neutron) is 2.\n          *Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 atoms × 2 = 8.*\n        *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** The formula contains 1 atom of Aluminium. The only stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n          *Total mass from Aluminium = 1 atom × 27 = 27.*\n\n    *   **Sum the masses:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is my reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify the Reactants and Products**\n\n1.  **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**: This tells us Substance X is a deuterated or otherwise isotopically labeled compound. The heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is the most common heavy isotope used in chemical synthesis.\n\n2.  **\"...reacts violently with liquid Y...\"**: This suggests a very energetic reaction, typical of highly reactive species like alkali metals or powerful hydrides with a protic solvent like water.\n\n3.  **\"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**: Let's analyze potential simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **(p = n)**. This is a perfect match. So, **W = D₂**.\n    *   C₂H₂ (Acetylene): 8 protons, 6 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   C₂D₂ (Deuterated Acetylene): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. **(p = n)**. This is another possibility.\n\n4.  **\"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**:\n    *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82°C).\n    *   The value 277 K is a clear indicator that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   Since precipitate G releases D₂O upon heating, G must be a deuterated hydroxide or a hydrate containing D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide: `M(OD)n --(heat)--> MxOy + D₂O`.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Chemical Reaction and Identify Substance X**\n\n*   We know the reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G) which can be heated to form D₂O (B).\n*   Let's synthesize these facts:\n    `Substance X + Liquid Y → D₂(g) + G(s)`\n    `G(s) --(heat)--> ... + D₂O(l)`\n*   For D₂ gas to be a product, the reactants must provide the deuterium. Since X contains the heavy isotope, it's the source of 'D'. Since G yields D₂O, Liquid Y must also be a source of 'D' and 'O'. This makes **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n*   Now the reaction is: `X + D₂O → D₂(g) + G(s)`.\n*   This means X reacts with D₂O to liberate D₂. This happens when X is a source of a reduced species that can be oxidized by D₂O's deuterium (D⁺). Hydride (H⁻) is a perfect candidate. So X is likely a metal hydride. Since X contains deuterium, it must be a metal **deuteride**.\n*   Let's consider common deuteride reagents used in organic chemistry, as hinted by the last clues. The most powerful and common are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n*   **Let's test X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Clue: \"...and its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**: The analog is LiAlH₄, a ubiquitous reducing agent. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction with D₂O**: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`.\n        *   Reacts violently? Yes.\n        *   Releases D₂ gas (W)? Yes.\n        *   Forms a precipitate G? Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide, **G = Al(OD)₃**, would precipitate.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O)? `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. Yes. This fits all the clues.\n    *   **Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**: A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols, yielding a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n*   All evidence strongly points to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks to \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X... if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved: Li is mostly ⁷Li, Al is ¹⁰⁰% ²⁷Al, and the hydrogen is specified as the heavier isotope D (²H).\n    *   Mass Number (Li) = 7\n    *   Mass Number (Al) = 27\n    *   Mass Number (D) = 2\n*   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements**:\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (H)\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al)\n*   **Calculate the total mass from each of these elements in the formula LiAlD₄**:\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Al): There is one atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass from lightest element (H): There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all in the form of Deuterium (D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass**:\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Al) + (Total mass from H/D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope:** This immediately brings to mind deuterium (D or ²H), a common heavy isotope of hydrogen used in chemical synthesis.\n    *   **X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W:** This suggests a very reactive substance, like an active metal hydride, reacting with a protic solvent like water.\n    *   **Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons:** Let's analyze potential gases.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Matches, but He is inert and an unlikely product of a violent reaction.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Protons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. This is a perfect match and consistent with X containing deuterium. So, **W is D₂**.\n    *   **X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry:** This points towards common deuterated reagents. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent, and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), is also widely used. Let's hypothesize that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction and Precipitate G:** If X is LiAlD₄, it reacts violently with water. To produce D₂ gas, the source of all the deuterium must be from the reactants. The reaction must be with a deuterated solvent. Let's assume Liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide (and its deuterated version) is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**. This fits the description.\n    *   **Precipitate G, when heated, releases B, with melting point ~277 K:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes dehydration.\n        *   `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`\n        *   So, substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C, which is 273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K. This value is extremely close to 277 K. This clue strongly confirms our identifications. **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups to alcohols.\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH` (3 oxygens) + LiAlD₄ --> (after workup) --> `R-CD(OH)-CH₂(OH)` (a diol, with 2 oxygens).\n        *   The product has 2 oxygen atoms, which matches the problem description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity of Substance X**\n\n    All clues consistently point to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are:\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), present as its isotope Deuterium (D), Atomic Number = 1\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question further specifies: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all the atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   Let's use integer atomic masses for simplicity, which is sufficient for multiple-choice questions.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H or D) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   4 atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium).\n        *   1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n    *   Now, we sum the masses as instructed:\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative (total) mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This strongly suggests a common reagent where hydrogen has been replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are frequently used in organic chemistry. Their deuterated analogs, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), are also common for isotopic labeling. So, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"Reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"**\n        *   Metal hydrides and deuterides react violently with water. Let's assume Y is water. If it's normal water (H₂O), the reaction with LiAlD₄ would produce a mix of gases (H₂, HD, D₂). If the liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is:\n            LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   Let's analyze the gas produced, W = D₂ (Deuterium gas).\n        *   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A molecule of D₂ therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the clue that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This supports the idea that X is a deuteride and Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**\n        *   From the reaction above, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n        *   When metal hydroxides/deuteroxides are heated, they decompose to the metal oxide and water/heavy water.\n            2 Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)\n        *   The substance *released* is B, which must be the volatile D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   We deduced B is D₂O. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This confirms that B is D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid has a general structure R-(C=O)-R'-COOH. It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alcohols (-CH(OH)-) and (-CH₂OH), respectively. NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n        *   The reaction R-(C=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH results in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   This confirms that X must be the more powerful reducing agent, LiAlD₄, rather than NaBD₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Elements and Their Masses:**\n\n    *   Based on the analysis, **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n    *   The elements present in the molecule are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   To find the lightest and heaviest elements, we compare their atomic masses (or simply their position in the periodic table).\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): An isotope of Hydrogen (Z=1). Mass number = 2.\n        *   Lithium (Li): (Z=3). Atomic mass ≈ 7 u.\n        *   Aluminium (Al): (Z=13). Atomic mass ≈ 27 u.\n    *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Deuterium (D)** and the **heaviest element is Aluminium (Al)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". This means we must sum the mass of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element found in one formula unit of LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers, which is standard for this type of problem and aligns with the integer answer choices.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Al in LiAlD₄. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Mass from Al = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four atoms of D in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Mass from D = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative (total) mass:**\n        *   Total = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: Melting Point of B**\n    *   The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, Deuterium Oxide) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues 4 and 5: Precipitate G and Substance B**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which would yield a metal oxide and heavy water.\n    *   `Metal(OD)x --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B)`\n    *   This means the precipitate **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 2 and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and the precipitate G.\n    *   Since the products (G) contain deuterium, the reactants (X and/or Y) must also contain deuterium.\n    *   The clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" This confirms X contains deuterium.\n    *   Let's analyze Gas W: \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   Deuterium atom (D): 1 proton, 1 neutron.\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This is a perfect candidate for W.\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, a deuteride (Substance X) must react with a deuterium source (Liquid Y). The most plausible candidate for a liquid deuterium source that would react violently with a reactive deuteride is heavy water itself.\n    *   So, we can deduce: **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction is between Substance X (a deuteride) and D₂O.\n    *   Example reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   Clue 8 states that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents rather than simple binary compounds. Strong reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) are widely used. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Clue 7 states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (or its analog LiAlD₄) reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: R-C(=O)-R' → R-CH(OH)-R' (1 oxygen).\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: R-COOH → R-CH₂OH (1 oxygen).\n        *   Therefore, the reduction of a keto acid by substance X produces a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This reaction chemistry is a perfect match for **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride**. Its non-deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Thus, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Entire Reaction**\n    *   X = LiAlD₄\n    *   Y = D₂O\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   Gas W = D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons). Check.\n    *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Check.\n    *   Heating G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This produces B=D₂O. Check.\n    *   Melting point of B ≈ 277K. Check.\n    *   All clues are consistent with X = LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use integer mass numbers as the options are integers.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest element** (by atomic number) is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   **Heaviest element** (by atomic number) is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states, \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n    This also means the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is Deuterium (D or ²H). Therefore, Substance X must contain Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W.**\n    The gas W, released in the reaction, has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some small gas molecules that could be formed:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Contains two Deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, the D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. (p=n). This is a perfect match.\n    *   N₂: Contains two ¹⁴N atoms. Each has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n    *   CO: Contains ¹²C (6p, 6n) and ¹⁶O (8p, 8n). The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is also a possibility.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X.**\n    We know X contains Deuterium (D) and reacts to produce D₂ gas. It is also mentioned that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common deuterated reagents.\n    Let's consider powerful reducing agents, as they can react with certain substances to produce hydrogen (or deuterium) gas.\n    A prime candidate is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This fits the clue.\n    *   It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium. This fits the clue.\n\n4.  **Verify the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is LiAlD₄.\n    X (LiAlD₄) reacts \"violently with liquid Y\" to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G.\n    LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be analogous and violent. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established in step 2, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. Thus, **Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G**. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Aluminum hydroxide is heated, it decomposes to aluminum oxide and water (2 Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O). Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield B (D₂O): 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. We already identified B as D₂O. This confirms the reaction sequence.\n\n5.  **Verify the final clue.**\n    \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group (3 oxygen atoms total).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    Having confidently identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**, we can perform the calculation.\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, in the form of Deuterium isotope D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula. We will use integer atomic masses (mass numbers) as suggested by the integer options.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula contains four atoms of Hydrogen, specifically the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The formula contains one atom of Aluminum. The most common stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C). However, the clue mentions \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\". This strongly suggests we are dealing with heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O). The melting point of D₂O is 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to 277 K.\n        *   **Conclusion:** **B is D₂O (Heavy Water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** The release of water (or heavy water) upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of a hydrate (or in this case, a \"deuterate\"). The substance G must be a metal hydroxide-d, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** Let's assume Substance X is a common reducing agent used in organic chemistry that incorporates a heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium, D). Prime candidates are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). The \"very close analog\" mentioned in another clue would be LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄, both standard reagents.\n        *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄**. It's known to react violently with protic substances. If it reacts with D₂O (heavy water), the reaction would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n            *   **Liquid Y:** Y would be D₂O. This is consistent.\n            *   **Precipitate G:** The product Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide) is the heavy-water analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ would decompose to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (Substance B). This fits perfectly.\n            *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂ (dideuterium). Let's check its neutron and proton count. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the clue that the number of neutrons and protons is the same.\n        *   This hypothesis (X=LiAlD₄, Y=D₂O, W=D₂, G=Al(OD)₃, B=D₂O) works for all clues so far.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH). Substance X, LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄), is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both the ketone to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OD) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OD). The final product, a diol, has only 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X**\n\n    *   All the evidence points to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value**\n\n    *   **Question:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X...\"\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:** We compare the elements by their atomic mass (or mass number, as the options are integers).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Lithium (Li): Mass number of the common isotope is 7.\n        *   Aluminum (Al): Mass number of the only stable isotope is 27.\n        *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as D).\n        *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Al).\n\n    *   **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative mass, summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n        *   **Mass from heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   **Mass from lightest element (H/D):** There are four atoms of Deuterium. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Gas W:** The first critical clue is that gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's consider simple diatomic gases.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Total: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Protons ≠ Neutrons).\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each D (²H) has 1 proton, 1 neutron. Total: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Protons = Neutrons). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's consider another possibility, Deuterated Ammonia (ND₃), as it can be formed from nitrides reacting with heavy water. For ¹⁴N, we have 7 protons and 7 neutrons. For D, we have 1 proton and 1 neutron. In ND₃, Total protons = 7 + 3*(1) = 10. Total neutrons = 7 + 3*(1) = 10. (Protons = Neutrons). So, W could be D₂ or ND₃.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C).\n    *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This confirms that the reaction involves deuterium and that substance B is D₂O.\n    *   Substance G is a precursor to B, formed as a precipitate. When heated, it releases D₂O. This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide (a compound that forms a hydroxide precipitate which can then be dehydrated/de-deuterated). For example, `M(OD)n --(heat)--> Oxide + D₂O`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Reaction and Identify X:**\n    *   The reaction is `X + Y -> W (gas) + G (precipitate)`. We know B=D₂O, and G releases B, and Y is a liquid. The source of all the deuterium must be from X and/or Y. Since B is D₂O, it makes sense that the liquid Y is also D₂O.\n    *   **Path 1: W = D₂.** The reaction `X + D₂O -> D₂ + G (precipitate)` is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n    *   **Path 2: W = ND₃.** The reaction `X + D₂O -> ND₃ + G (precipitate)` would require X to be a metal nitride (e.g., Mg₃N₂). `Mg₃N₂ + 6D₂O -> 2ND₃ + 3Mg(OD)₂`. G would be Mg(OD)₂, which fits. However, the first clue states that \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". Metal nitrides like Mg₃N₂ don't inherently contain an isotope. This clue points to X itself being the deuterated compound, making Path 1 far more likely.\n\n4.  **Focus on Path 1 (W = D₂):** We are looking for a substance X which is a deuteride, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O.\n    *   A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry that fit this description are complex metal hydrides, and their deuterated analogs. The prompt specifically mentions that \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    *   Let's consider Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, LiAlD₄. Its analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic synthesis.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ against all clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: Contains deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. **✓**\n        *   **Y = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`. This is a known, violent reaction.\n        *   **Gas W**: D₂. We confirmed this has equal protons and neutrons. **✓**\n        *   **Precipitate G**: Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.

It releases D₂O. **✓**\n        *   **Substance B**: D₂O, whose melting point is ~277 K. **✓**\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid**: LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups. The resulting product, a diol, will contain two oxygen atoms. **✓**\n        *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent**: The analog LiAlH₄ is a cornerstone reagent. **✓**\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity of X:** All evidence points conclusively to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (as Deuterium).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all Aluminium atoms and all Deuterium atoms in one molecule of LiAlD₄.\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the most common/stable isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminium (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there is **one** Al atom and **four** D atoms.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of Al) + 4 * (Mass of D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 4 * (2)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X** contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its close analog. Its reaction with a keto acid produces a compound with 2 oxygen atoms. This strongly suggests X is a deuterated reducing agent, like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). The corresponding common analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄. The reduction of a keto acid (R-CO-COOH, 3 oxygens) by these agents typically yields a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, 2 oxygens) or a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH, 3 oxygens for NaBH4 and 2 for LiAlH4 after acidic workup). The product containing 2 oxygens fits well with a powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ or its deuterated version.\n\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Reacts violently with X.\n    *   **Gas W:** Released during the reaction. A key property is that its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons (N=P).\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Forms during the reaction.\n    *   **Substance B:** Released when G is heated. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This melting point is famously that of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope in Substance X must be Deuterium (D, or ²H). This confirms X is a deuterated compound.\n    *   G releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, as metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. For example, `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. So, G is probably a deuterated metal hydroxide precipitate.\n    *   The reaction `X + Y -> W + G` must form this deuterated hydroxide. This means the metal must come from X and the oxygen must come from Y.\n    *   Let's test the potential candidates for X.\n        *   If X = NaBD₄, the metal is Boron. Boron hydroxides or borates formed (like Na[B(OD)₄]) are generally soluble, which contradicts the formation of a precipitate G.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄, the metals are Lithium and Aluminum. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate. This makes LiAlD₄ a very strong candidate for X.\n\n3.  **Identify the Full Reaction:**\n    *   Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   To form G = Al(OD)₃, X must react with a source of \"OD\" groups. The simplest and most direct way to do this is to react it with **Y = D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   Let's write the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   Now, let's check if this reaction satisfies all the clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: A deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, a common organic reagent. (Check)\n        *   **Y = D₂O**: A liquid. (Check)\n        *   **Violent reaction?**: LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. LiAlD₄'s reaction with D₂O is analogous and also violent. (Check)\n        *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**: Al(OD)₃ is a solid precipitate. (Check)\n        *   **G --(heat)--> B = D₂O**: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases D₂O. (Check)\n        *   **Gas W = D₂**: Let's check the proton/neutron count for a deuterium molecule (D₂). Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons** and **2 neutrons**. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. (Check)\n\n    *   The proposed reaction system (X=LiAlD₄, Y=D₂O) perfectly matches all the details given in the problem.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question states that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\". We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n        *   **For the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of hydrogen in the molecule, all of which are the heavy isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. So, the total mass contribution from the lightest element is `4 atoms * 2 = 8`.\n        *   **For the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of aluminum in the molecule. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is 27. The total mass contribution from the heaviest element is `1 atom * 27 = 27`.\n    *   The **cumulative atomic mass** is the sum of these two values: `8 + 27 = 35`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X** contains a heavier isotope of an element.\n    *   X reacts violently with liquid **Y**.\n    *   This reaction produces a gas **W**. A molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   A precipitate **G** is formed.\n    *   Heating G releases substance **B**.\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X has a \"very close analog\" also used in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:**\n    The crucial clue is that gas W has an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n). Let's examine common diatomic gases using the most common isotopes:\n    *   H₂ (¹H): 2p, 0n. No.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O): 16p, 16n. Yes.\n    *   CO (¹²C, ¹⁶O): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n    *   NO (¹⁴N, ¹⁶O): 15p, 15n. Yes.\n\n    However, the clue about the \"heavier isotope\" strongly suggests we should consider isotopes. Let's look at hydrogen's heavier isotope, Deuterium (D or ²H), which has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   **D₂ (²H₂):** Each atom has 1p, 1n. The D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the condition perfectly and incorporates the \"heavier isotope\" clue. This is a very strong candidate for W.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance B:**\n    The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost exact match. So, **B is heavy water, D₂O.**\n\n4.  **Identify Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   If gas W is D₂ and B is D₂O, it strongly implies a reaction system involving deuterated compounds.\n    *   Let's hypothesize X is a deuteride reagent. A common class of such reagents are complex metal hydrides used for reduction in organic chemistry. A powerful one is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated version would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" would be LiAlH₄, a staple in organic chemistry labs. This fits the clue.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents. If B (D₂O) is produced by heating G, it's likely that the initial liquid reactant, Y, was also D₂O. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with D₂O, so **Y is D₂O.**\n    *   Let's write the reaction:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)\n    *   In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is insoluble in water and would form a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃.**\n    *   Now, let's check if heating G (Al(OD)₃) produces B (D₂O):\n        2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)\n    *   This decomposition reaction is correct.\n\n5.  **Confirm with the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n    *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols (-CH(OH)-) and carboxylic acids to primary alcohols (-CH₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms our identification of X as a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Solve the Final Calculation:**\n    *   **Substance X is LiAlD₄.**\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses (mass numbers) of the most common/relevant isotopes:\n        *   Li: ⁷Li (mass ≈ 7)\n        *   Al: ²⁷Al (mass = 27)\n        *   D: ²H (mass = 2)\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by mass:\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (as Deuterium), mass = 2\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum, mass = 27\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses\" of these elements in the molecule, specifying that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Sum of these cumulative masses:**\n        Sum = (Total mass of H) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated sum is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82°C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope in X:** Since D₂O is involved, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the description of Substance X is **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. A molecule of W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's test some simple gases.\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Incorrect)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (Correct)\n    *   Thus, gas **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   The reaction of X and Y produces D₂ gas. Since X contains deuterium, it must be a deuteride compound. For D₂ to be produced, the other reactant, Y, must also be a source of deuterium. The most logical candidate for liquid Y is D₂O (the same as substance B).\n    *   The reaction of a deuteride with heavy water is violent. The clue \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards a common reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a prime candidate. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It releases D₂ gas (W), which matches our finding.\n    *   It forms two products in the solution: LiOD (soluble in D₂O) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide). Al(OD)₃ is the deuterium analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate. So, the precipitate **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which is substance B.\n    *   All these points are consistent.\n\n5.  **Verify with the final clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms in the simplest structures (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n    *   R-CO-COOH (keto acid, 3 oxygens) --[1. LiAlD₄] / [2. Workup]--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (a diol, 2 oxygens).\n    *   This reaction results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms, confirming our identification.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing the masses of all their atoms present in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the calculation, as is standard for such problems leading to integer answers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) = 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum's most stable isotope (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   There are 4 atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) in LiAlD₄. Their total mass is 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   There is 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum) in LiAlD₄. Its mass is 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" 277 Kelvin is 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K), but heavy water (D₂O) melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\". Since we've identified B as D₂O, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen. Therefore, **Substance X must contain Deuterium**.\n    *   **Clue 5 & G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\". Heating metal hydroxides (M(OH)ₙ) typically yields a metal oxide and water (H₂O). By analogy, heating a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₙ) would yield a metal oxide and heavy water (D₂O). So, **G must be a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   **Clue 3 & W:** \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium, let's consider deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. Thus, **W is very likely D₂ gas**.\n    *   **Clue 2, 8, 9 & X:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry, and it reacts with a keto acid. These properties strongly point towards powerful reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Since X contains deuterium, the candidates are their deuterated analogs: lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBD₄).\n    *   **The Reaction:** Let's test the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a suitable liquid Y that would produce the identified products. The most logical reaction to produce D₂ gas is the reaction of the deuteride with heavy water (D₂O), which would also be the source for the deuteroxide precipitate.\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Validation of the Reaction:**\n        *   This reaction is known to be extremely violent. (Matches clue 2)\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble), aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate), and deuterium gas (D₂). This matches the formation of precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃** and gas **W = D₂**.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces **B = D₂O**.\n        *   The analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry. (Matches clue 9)\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) would reduce the keto group to a deuterated alcohol (R-CD(OH)-COOH). The product contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), meaning it has 2 oxygen atoms. (Matches clue 8)\n\n    *   Based on all the clues, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope has a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (H). Its isotope in the molecule is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of 2. There are four D atoms in the formula.\n    *   The term \"cumulative atomic masses\" and \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed\" means we need to sum the mass of the single Al atom and the four D atoms.\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n    *   Using integer mass numbers for the calculation: Sum = 27 + (4 × 2)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Identify Gas W and Substance B:**\n    1.  The problem states that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze common diatomic gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, a heavier isotope of hydrogen): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Thus, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect fit.\n    2.  This suggests that Substance X contains deuterium (D).\n    3.  Substance B has a melting point of approximately 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    1.  Substance G releases D₂O (B) when heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydroxide (like M(OD)x) or a deuterated hydrate.\n    2.  Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas D₂ and a precipitate G. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Given the presence of deuterium everywhere, it is logical to assume the reaction is between a metal deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    3.  Reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G, precipitate) + D₂ (W, gas)`.\n    4.  So, **Y is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n*   **Use the Organic Chemistry Clue to Identify X:**\n    1.  \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    2.  \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, one oxygen must be removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol (`-COOH` -> `-CH₂OH`).\n        *   Therefore, X must be a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. The most common reagents for this are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), with LiAlH₄ being much stronger and necessary for reducing carboxylic acids.\n    3.  The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since X incorporates a heavier isotope (Deuterium), **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Verify the Reaction with LiAlD₄:**\n    1.  Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    2.  This reaction is known to be violent.\n    3.  It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    4.  It produces a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    5.  When G is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    6.  All clues fit perfectly.\n\n*   **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    1.  Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    2.  The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    3.  The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    4.  The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    5.  The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms**: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). Its mass is 27 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms**: There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). Each has a mass of approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    6.  Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical properties and reactions described, we can deduce the identities of the substances involved.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". The reaction involves a deuterated compound (implied by the presence of D₂O). Let's examine possible hydrogen-based gases:\n    *   H₂: Contains 2 protons (1 from each H) and 0 neutrons. Does not match.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Contains 2 protons (1 from each D) and 2 neutrons (1 from each D). This matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance Y:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂. For D₂ to be produced, the reaction likely involves two sources of deuterium. Since Substance X is a deuterated compound and B is D₂O, the most plausible identity for the liquid reactant Y is also **heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Identification of Substance X:** We are looking for a deuterated compound that is a common organic reagent, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (G). Let's test Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of the common reducing agent LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (Substance G).\n    *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a molecule with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium, D).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (present as 1 atom of Al).\n    *   We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D has a mass number of 2; the common isotope of Al has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The nature of substance B.**\n    *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. However, it is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O or ²H₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify **B as D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of gas W.**\n    *   \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Since the system clearly involves deuterium (from the identification of D₂O), let's examine hydrogen and its isotopes as components of the gas.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each ¹H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n    *   HD (Protium-Deuterium): ¹H has (1p, 0n), ²H has (1p, 1n). HD molecule has 2 protons, 1 neutron.

(This fits the condition).\n    *   While other gases like ¹⁴N₂ (14p, 14n) or ¹²C¹⁶O (14p, 14n) also fit this numerical criterion, the presence of D₂O elsewhere in the reaction system makes D₂ the most chemically consistent candidate for gas W.\n    *   So, we identify **W as D₂ (di-deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify G, X, and Y.**\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W (D₂) + Precipitate G.\n    *   Also, heating G releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, 2M(OD)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The fact that a precipitate forms suggests a metal hydroxide that is insoluble, such as Al(OH)₃ or Mg(OH)₂.\n    *   Let's consider **G = Al(OD)₃** (aluminum deuteroxide), as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Heating it would give: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   Now, we can assemble the reaction: X must contain Al and D. The reaction produces D₂ gas and a precipitate of Al(OD)₃ after reacting with liquid Y. To provide the oxygen and the extra deuterium for the products, Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The full reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + Al(OD)₃ + [soluble byproduct].\n    *   Let's look at Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent.

It will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". This means we sum the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements in one molecule of X.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **4** atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **1** atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Liquid Y**\n- The problem states that a gas W is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n- Let's analyze some simple molecules:\n    - H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Not equal)\n    - **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Equal)\n    - He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Equal, but a noble gas, unlikely to be a product of a violent reaction).\n    - **HF (Hydrogen Fluoride):** H (1p, 0n) + F-19 (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Equal)\n- The problem also states that a precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C or 276.97 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n- If the reaction releases D₂O, it's highly likely that deuterated compounds are involved. Specifically, if B is D₂O, the reacting liquid Y is almost certainly D₂O as well, which acts as the solvent and reactant.\n- If Y is D₂O, and the reaction is with substance X, the gas released (W) must be D₂. The reaction cannot produce HF if there is no Fluorine source. This confirms W = D₂, and the reaction involves deuterium transfer.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X**\n- Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n- The prompt says, \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards deuterated versions of common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), or simpler hydrides like Lithium Hydride (LiH). The \"analog\" would be the standard hydrogen version.\n- The next clue is: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    - A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-(...)-COOH. It contains at least three oxygen atoms.\n    - To get a product with only two oxygen atoms, both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced.\n    - LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids (to alcohols). The product of reducing a keto acid would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-(...)-CH₂OH, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    - NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent that typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be R-CH(OH)-(...)-COOH, which still has three oxygen atoms.\n- Therefore, the analog of X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄. This means substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify LiAlD₄ with all clues**\n- **Formula:** LiAlD₄\n- **Heavier isotope:** Contains Deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of Hydrogen. ✓\n- **Organic reagent analog:** The analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and important reagent. ✓\n- **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. This reaction is violent, similar to LiAlH₄ with water. ✓\n- **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. ✓\n- **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. ✓\n- **G releases B on heating:** Heating aluminum hydroxide dehydrates it (`2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`). Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O. So B = D₂O. ✓\n- **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. ✓\n- All clues perfectly match the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n- The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n- **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n- The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n- **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number Z).\n- **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number Z).\n- **Mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen is present as 4 atoms of its isotope Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    - Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n- **Mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** In LiAlD₄, there is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n    - Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n- **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    - Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances.**\n    *   **Substance B and the heavy isotope:** The clue states that B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 4 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance B is heavy water (D₂O), and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W is released, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n        *   Let's analyze deuterium gas, D₂. A single deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   Since the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2), **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** We are told \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". We've identified W as D₂. A violent reaction that produces deuterium gas and involves deuterated compounds strongly suggests the reaction of a powerful deuteride reagent with heavy water.\n        *   Let's assume **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction produces a **precipitate G**.\n        *   When G is heated, it releases **B (D₂O)**. This is consistent with the thermal decomposition of a metal deuteroxide (formed in the reaction) into a metal oxide and heavy water. For example: `M(OD)n -> Metal_Oxide + D₂O`.\n\n    *   **Substance X:** We have several clues for X:\n        *   It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n        *   Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". This points to a common laboratory reagent where a hydrogen atom is replaced by deuterium.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂, and a precipitate G, which we suspect is a metal deuteroxide. A very well-known reaction involves lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Let's check if LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n            *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is famously violent.\n            *   **Gas W:** It produces D₂, which we identified as W.\n            *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OH)₃ is a known precipitate (insoluble gelatinous solid). Therefore, Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. G = Al(OD)₃.\n            *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O, which we identified as B.\n            *   **Organic Chemistry:** LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent, and so is LiAlD₄. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has two reducible groups: a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH). LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ reduces both. The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-), and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH). The final product, a diol, `R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`, contains two oxygen atoms.\n        *   All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula for substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in the compound are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   We will use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes, as suggested by the integer answers:\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D) = 2\n        *   Mass of Lithium (Li) = 7 (for the most common isotope, ⁷Li)\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (Al) = 27 (for its only stable isotope, ²⁷Al)\n    *   Comparing these masses, the lightest element is Deuterium (mass 2) and the heaviest element is Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   The problem states \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element type and all atoms of the heaviest element type in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Al in LiAlD₄. Its mass is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (D):** There are four atoms of D in LiAlD₄. The cumulative mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total Sum:** The sum of these cumulative masses is 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    The cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**: This strongly suggests a deuterated compound, where deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen, replaces protium (¹H). Such compounds are frequently used in chemistry, especially in organic chemistry, for studying reaction mechanisms.\n\n    *   **\"...and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**: This points towards a common pair of reagents, one being the standard and the other being its deuterated version. The most famous examples are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). These are powerful reducing agents. So, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n\n    *   **\"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**:\n        *   The reaction of metal hydrides with protic solvents like water is famously violent.\n        *   Let's analyze Gas W. We need a molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n            *   Nitrogen gas (N₂): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons.\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   The reaction involves Substance X, which is deuterated. It is highly plausible that the gas W is deuterium gas (D₂). For D₂ to be produced, the deuterium atoms must come from both the reagent (X) and the liquid (Y). If X is LiAlD₄ and it reacts with normal water (H₂O), the gas would be HD, which has 2 protons and 1 neutron (unequal).\n        *   Therefore, the reaction must be between the deuterated reagent (X) and a deuterated liquid (Y). The most common deuterated liquid is heavy water (D₂O).\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → \"products\" + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction pathway successfully produces D₂ gas, which fits the description of W.\n\n    *   **\"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**:\n        *   Let's complete our proposed reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Thus, Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. This fits the clue.\n        *   Now, what happens when G is heated? `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The substance released, B, is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n    *   **\"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**:\n        *   We identified B as heavy water (D₂O). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K.\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This serves as a strong confirmation of our hypothesis.\n\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**:\n        *   X is LiAlD₄, a powerful reducing agent. Keto acids contain both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols. For example, the reduction of pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) would yield 1,2-propanediol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This resulting diol molecule contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue also aligns perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: Based on the comprehensive analysis of all clues, Substance X is unequivocally identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n\n    *   The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form, Deuterium D).\n    *   The atomic number identifies the element: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to find the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula LiAlD₄.

This is a strong indicator of heavy water, D₂O, whose melting point is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D), the isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Substance X and Organic Reaction**: The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with substance X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction reaction, characteristic of reagents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Given that X contains deuterium, the logical conclusion is that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. LiAlD₄ is a close analog to LiAlH₄, which is widely used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   **The Violent Reaction**: The clues describe X reacting violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (D₂O).

This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n7.  **Final Identification and Calculation.**\n    *   Substance X is definitively **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in X.\n        *   Atomic number of H: 1\n        *   Atomic number of Li: 3\n        *   Atomic number of Al: 13\n    *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** (present as D) and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for each isotope.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are 4 deuterium atoms.\n        *   The common stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is 1 aluminum atom.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical properties described:\n1.  **Substance X Identification:**\n    *   Its use as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with a \"close analog,\" and the incorporation of a \"heavier isotope\" points towards deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBD₄). Their analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄.\n    *   The violent reaction with a liquid Y (water, H₂O) and the release of gas W with an equal number of protons and neutrons identifies W as Deuterium gas (D₂), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This implies X is a deuterated compound (contains D) and Y is a source of deuterium, like heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   The precipitate G that forms is Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). When heated, it decomposes (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O), releasing B.\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This matches the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). This confirms B is D₂O.\n    *   The reaction with a keto acid to produce a product with two oxygen atoms is characteristic of LiAlD₄, which reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH).\n    *   Therefore, Substance X is conclusively identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1). The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of *all* instances of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen as Deuterium, D)**: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. The mass number of the deuterium isotope (¹H²) is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum, Al)**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Mass from Deuterium) + (Mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The standard melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is the isotope Deuterium, ²H) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very strong indication that **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X's Isotope:** Since the reaction pathway produces heavy water, the \"heavier isotope\" incorporated into Substance X must be **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze potential gases:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is `X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`.\n    *   Substance X contains Deuterium (D). It reacts with a liquid Y to produce D₂. A very common reaction of this type involves a deuterated hydride reacting with a source of deuterium, like heavy water. So, it's highly likely that the liquid **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   When the precipitate G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, like M(OD)x, which decomposes on heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X is a substance containing Deuterium. Its non-deuterated analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction `X + D₂O` is violent and produces D₂ gas. This is characteristic of strong reducing agents like metal hydrides. The most common are NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride). Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a famously powerful and common reducing agent.\n    *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4 D₂↑`.\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate Al(OD)₃ (G). This fits the description. Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B), which also fits.\n\n6.  **Confirm with the Final Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). In total, it has **3 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups. A ketone is reduced to an alcohol, and a carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol.\n    *   `R-CO-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (and workup) → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH`\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains two alcohol (-OH) groups. Thus, it contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic #3), Aluminum (Al, atomic #13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic #1).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D or ²H).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We sum the masses of all the D and Al atoms in the molecule, using their mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of D = 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of Al = 27 amu.\n    *   In LiAlD₄, there are 4 atoms of D and 1 atom of Al.\n    *   Total Mass = (4 × Mass of D) + (1 × Mass of Al)\n    *   Total Mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis matches the output from the code execution. The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{35}$.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X**:\n    *   The problem states that \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" and that its reaction with a keto acid results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids (R-CO-COOH) have 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups would lead to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   This points to a powerful reducing agent. A common one is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n    *   Since Substance X \"incorporates a heavier isotope\", it is likely the deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Verify with Other Clues**:\n    *   **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (Y = H₂O).\n    *   **Gas W**: The reaction produces gas. One possible reaction is the thermal decomposition of X due to the heat generated: `LiAlD₄ → LiD + Al + 3/2 D₂`. The gas produced is Deuterium gas (**W = D₂**). A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, matching the description.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The main reaction with water is `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4HD(g)`. The precipitate **G is Aluminium Hydroxide (Al(OH)₃)**.\n    *   **Substance B**: When precipitate G (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes: `2 Al(OH)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O`. The substance released is water (**B = H₂O**). The melting point of water is 273.15 K, which is \"very close to 277 K\" as stated.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D). Its mass number is 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al). Its mass number is 27.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   In one molecule of LiAlD₄:\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms, so 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom, so 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nSubstance X, LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride), is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry, and it is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄.\nThe lightest element is Hydrogen (in the form of Deuterium), and the heaviest is Aluminum.\nThere are four atoms of Deuterium (mass number ≈ 2) and one atom of Aluminum (mass number ≈ 27).\nCumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 * 2 = 8\nCumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 * 27 = 27\nTotal cumulative mass: 8 + 27 = 35\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B.**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    However, the problem mentions that substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope\". This suggests we should consider heavy water (D₂O), where D is deuterium, the heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C, which is indeed very close to 277 K.\n    Therefore, Substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Substance X.**\n    Since B (D₂O) is produced from X, X must contain deuterium (D). The problem also states that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent and its deuterated version. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). Let's hypothesize that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the Reaction Chemistry.**\n    Let's check if LiAlD₄ fits the described reaction sequence.\n    *   **Reaction of X with Y:** X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. Hydride reagents react violently with protic solvents like water. Since the products contain deuterium, the logical choice for Y is D₂O. The reaction is:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, which perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a solid precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Heating G:** When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes:\n        `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`\n        This reaction releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. The entire sequence is consistent.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the Organic Chemistry Clue.**\n    A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols. The product of the reaction would be a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. For instance, reducing pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would yield a deuterated 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CD(OD)CD₂OD), which has two oxygen atoms. This clue further confirms X is LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    We have identified substance X as LiAlD₄. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within it.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number, Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic mass, A) is Aluminum (A ≈ 27 u). (Li has A ≈ 7 u).\n    *   The problem instructs that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all...must be summed.\" We will use integer mass numbers as the options are integers.\n    *   **Contribution from the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its only stable isotope, ²⁷Al, is 27.\n    *   **Contribution from the lightest element (H):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** The sum is the mass from Aluminum plus the mass from Deuterium:\n        `Sum = 27 + 8 = 35`\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The first critical clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    *   T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is characteristic of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which has a melting point of 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Substance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is typical behavior for a metal hydroxide, which dehydrates upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. Since D₂O is released, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n. The decomposition reaction is: M(OD)n (s) → Metal Oxide + D₂O (g). The fact that G is a precipitate narrows down the possibilities for the metal M.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's check common small molecules.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The molecule D₂ has **2 protons and 2 neutrons** (Yes).\n        *   N₂: Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule N₂ has **14 protons and 14 neutrons** (Yes).\n        *   CO: C has 6p, 6n; O has 8p, 8n. The molecule CO has **14 protons and 14 neutrons** (Yes).\n    *   Given that the system clearly involves deuterium (from B = D₂O), the most plausible candidate for the gas W is **D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reaction and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂(g) + G(s).\n    *   To produce D₂ gas, the deuterium atoms must come from the reactants. This points to a reaction between a deuteride donor (like a D⁻ source) and a deuterium acceptor (like a D⁺ source).\n    *   The classic violent reaction of this type is a metal hydride with water. To produce D₂ gas, a metal deuteride must react with a deuterated protic solvent, like D₂O.\n    *   Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction becomes: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → D₂ (W) + Metal Deuteroxide (G). This is a consistent and logical reaction pathway.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have more clues about X:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (we've established this is Deuterium, D).\n    *   It's a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" (the non-deuterated version) is also used.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups must be reduced to alcohols (forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This requires a very strong reducing agent, as weaker ones (like sodium borohydride) would not reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   A very common, strong reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly. It's a strong reducing agent, its analog is common, it's a metal deuteride.\n    *   Let's check if it forms a precipitate. The reaction is:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, as aluminium hydroxide is insoluble. Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and 3D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Identified by the lowest atomic number (Z). Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Identified by the highest atomic number. Aluminium (Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   The question states: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes present (D=²H, so mass number = 2; Al=²⁷Al, so mass number = 27).\n    *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 instances of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D).\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 instance of aluminium.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated for the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope and has a close analog used in organic chemistry.**\n        *   \"Heavier isotope\" often points to deuterium (D or ²H), a stable, heavier isotope of hydrogen (H or ¹H).\n        *   \"Close analog used in organic chemistry\" suggests a common reagent where H can be substituted with D. Powerful reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) are excellent candidates. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). Let's hypothesize that X is one of these.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.**\n        *   LiAlH₄ is known to react extremely violently with water. So, let's assume the deuterated analog, LiAlD₄ (our candidate for X), also reacts violently.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Let's analyze the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a liquid Y.\n        *   If Y is normal water (H₂O): `LiAlD₄ + 4 H₂O -> LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4 HD`. The gas (W) is HD (hydrogen deuteride). Let's check its proton/neutron count. Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. This scenario is incorrect.\n        *   Let's consider another possibility for liquid Y. To produce a gas rich in deuterium, the reagent Y should also contain deuterium. The most common deuterated liquid is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   If Y is heavy water (D₂O): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. The gas (W) is D₂ (di-deuterium gas). Let's check its proton/neutron count. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n        *   This establishes W as D₂ and Y as D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   From our proposed reaction, the products in the solution are LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), will also be a precipitate. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n        *   When metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) are heated, they decompose, releasing water (or heavy water). The reaction is: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`.\n        *   So, the released substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This strongly confirms that B is D₂O, G is Al(OD)₃, and our overall reaction scheme is correct.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A simple example is pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Our candidate for X is LiAlD₄, a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Reacting pyruvic acid with LiAlD₄ would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol, resulting in 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OD)CH₂OD after deuterated workup, or CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH after H₂O workup).\n        *   The resulting molecule, a diol, contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue exactly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X:** The substance is LiAlD₄.

Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to form a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` would decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide `MxOy` and D₂O (B).\n    *   The reaction also releases a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential simple gases involving deuterium:\n        *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (0 from H, 1 from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas)**: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). **Protons = Neutrons**. This is a perfect match. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Clues to Identify X and the Reaction.**\n    The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    And G(s) --(heat)--> Substance + D₂O(g).\n    For D₂ gas to be a product, X must be a deuteride, and it must react with a source of deuterium, which would be liquid Y. The most logical candidate for **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n    The precipitate G must be a metal deuteroxide. A common metal hydroxide that precipitates is Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. Its deuterated analog would be **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    The heating of aluminum hydroxide follows the reaction: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O.\n    Thus, heating our G would be: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (Substance B), confirming our hypothesis.\n    So, the reaction involves Aluminum (Al) and Deuterium (D). This strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuteride of aluminum.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 8 and 9: The nature of Substance X.**\n    *   Clue 9: X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n    *   Clue 8: The reaction of X with a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) gives a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains two functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH), totaling 3 oxygen atoms (in the simplest cases). Reducing both groups leads to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. A reagent powerful enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   The \"very close analog\" containing deuterium would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Identity of X as LiAlD₄.**\n    Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n    *   **Substance X is LiAlD₄.** Contains the heavy isotope D. (✓)\n    *   **Its close analog is LiAlH₄,** a very common organic reagent. (✓)\n    *   It reduces a keto acid to a diol, a product with **2 oxygen atoms**. (✓)\n    *   The reaction with Y = D₂O is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This reaction is famously **violent**.

    "The task is to select the most consistent answer among the provided candidates for the given chemistry problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Reasoning\n\nA thorough review of the candidate answers reveals a highly consistent logical process across the majority of the responses that provide detailed reasoning. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The clue \"The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K\" (which is 3.85 °C) is consistently used to identify substance B as **heavy water (D₂O)**, which melts at 3.82 °C. This is the cornerstone of the entire deduction.\n\n2.  **Identification of the Isotope and Gas W:** The identification of D₂O immediately establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved is **Deuterium (D)**. Following this, the gas W, described as having an equal number of protons and neutrons, is correctly identified as **Deuterium gas (D₂)**, as a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:** By combining all clues, substance X is systematically identified as **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   It contains the heavy isotope Deuterium (D).\n    *   Its \"very close analog,\" Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a major reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   Its reaction with a keto acid results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms, which is characteristic of a powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ reducing both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups.\n    *   Its violent reaction with heavy water (Y=D₂O) correctly produces D₂ gas (W) and an insoluble precipitate, Aluminium Deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃), which upon heating yields D₂O (B).\n\nThis chain of reasoning is present in almost every detailed answer, indicating a very strong consensus on the identity of the substances and the underlying chemical principles.\n\n### Analysis of the Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.\"\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (atomic number Z=13).\n*   **Calculation:** The instructions state to sum the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule. Using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (D=2, Al=27), the calculation is consistently performed as:\n    *   Mass from Aluminium (1 atom) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Mass from Deuterium (4 atoms) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n### Conclusion of Consistency\n\nThe vast majority of the candidate answers, despite their differing final answer letters, demonstrate a remarkably consistent process of reasoning and calculation. They almost unanimously conclude that the identity of substance X is LiAlD₄ and the required numerical value is 35. The inconsistencies primarily arise from an incorrect mapping of the calculated number (35) to the given lettered options (A=25, B=31, C=29, D=35).\n\nThe most consistent and logically sound answer is the one that correctly performs all steps, including the final mapping of the value to the option letter.\n\n*   The consistently derived numerical answer is **35**.\n*   This numerical answer corresponds to option **D**.\n*   Furthermore, a direct tally shows that the final answer tag <<<D>>> is the most frequently selected option (appearing 19 times out of 60).\n\nTherefore, both the logical derivation and the modal choice point to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The D₂ molecule has 2p and 2n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7p and 7n. The N₂ molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂ (Oxygen gas): Each ¹⁶O atom has 8p and 8n. The O₂ molecule has 16p and 16n. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. The CO molecule has 14p and 14n. This fits.\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): H has 1p, 0n. D has 1p, 1n. The HD molecule has 2p and 1n. This does not fit.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G forms. Heating G releases substance B, which has a melting point near 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This value is remarkably close to 277 K.\n        *   This strongly implies that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Connecting the clues:** If heating G releases D₂O (B), then G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, a compound that loses D₂O upon heating (a process similar to dehydration). The fact that D₂O is a product points to Deuterium being a key component of the system. This also supports D₂ as the identity of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We need a substance (X) containing Deuterium that reacts to form a deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) and D₂ gas (W).\n    *   **Clue 6: The organic chemistry connection.** \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. A very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both groups to alcohols (-OH). The product would be a diol, CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **The violent reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts extremely violently with water. Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (s) + 4 D₂O (l) → LiOD (aq) + Al(OD)₃ (s)↓ + 4 D₂ (g)↑`\n        *   This reaction is violent.\n        *   Gas W = D₂. As established, it has an equal number of protons and neutrons (2p, 2n). This fits.\n        *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Decomposition of G:** Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose.\n        *   Reaction: `2 Al(OD)₃ (s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ (s) + 3 D₂O (g)`\n        *   This reaction releases substance B = D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. This fits.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   We identify the lightest and heaviest elements by their atomic number (number of protons).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Atomic number (Z) = 1  **(Lightest)**\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminium (Al): Z = 13 **(Heaviest)**\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, Al = ²⁷Al).\n        *   **Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium (Al) in LiAlD₄. The mass number of the stable isotope of Al is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n        This points towards a compound used in isotopic labeling studies, often to trace reaction mechanisms. Deuterium (D or ²H), a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is very commonly used for this purpose.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        Let's analyze potential gases (W) with an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has p=2, n=2. This is a perfect fit, especially given the \"heavier isotope\" clue.\n        *   **N₂ (Nitrogen gas):** The common ¹⁴N isotope has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The N₂ molecule has p=14, n=14. This is a possibility.\n        *   **Other possibilities** like CO, ¹⁸O₂, etc., are less likely in the context of a simple, violent reaction.\n        The most plausible candidate for W is D₂ gas, which strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuterated compound (contains Deuterium). A violent reaction that produces a gas often involves a highly reactive substance with a protic solvent like water. If X is a deuteride and it produces D₂ gas, the other source of deuterium atoms must be the liquid Y. Therefore, **Liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n    *   **Let's propose a candidate for X.** A very common deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. It is the deuterated analog of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis (X = LiAlD₄) against the clues.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.**\n        The reaction between LiAlD₄ and D₂O would be:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n        This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O.\n        The products are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and **Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, which is insoluble and would form a precipitate (G). This fits the clue.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.**\n        Heating metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) often causes dehydration (or its equivalent).\n        Heating G (Al(OD)₃): 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)\n        So, the released substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. To convert to Kelvin: 273.15 + 3.82 = **276.97 K**. This value is indeed very close to 277 K. This strongly confirms our identification.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: >C=O → >CD(OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n        So, the entire keto acid molecule is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). A diol contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is perfectly consistent.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.**\n        X is LiAlD₄. Its very close analog is **LiAlH₄**. Both are cornerstone reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X (LiAlD₄):** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number): Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number): Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Interpret the calculation instruction:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        This means we must:\n        1.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen).\n        2.  Find the total mass contributed by all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminium).\n        3.  Sum these two totals.\n    *   **Perform the calculation using integer mass numbers (as the options are integers):**\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **4** deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n        *   The main isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **1** aluminium atom in LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formation of B and identify G.**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is a typical decomposition reaction for a hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide. Given that a precipitate (G) is formed in the initial reaction, G is likely a metal deuteroxide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 1 & 10: The nature of Substance X.**\n    Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since we've identified D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This, combined with the presence of deuterium, points towards common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs (LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄) are staples in organic chemistry.\n\n4.  **Propose identities for X, Y, W, and G and test the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlD₄ is known to react violently with water and similar protic solvents.\n    *   **Formation of gas W:** Clue 3 states that gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n        *   If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction would be LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4HD. The gas is HD (Hydrogen Deuteride). Let's check its composition: Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. So, Y is not H₂O.\n        *   What if liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)? The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n        *   Let's check the gas W = D₂ (Deuterium gas). Composition: Protons = 1 + 1 = 2. Neutrons = 1 + 1 = 2. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **Formation of precipitate G:** In this reaction, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so it's certain that Al(OD)₃ would be a precipitate as well. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Al(OD)₃ is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This also fits.\n\n5.  **Confirm with Clue 9: The reaction with a keto acid.**\n    A keto acid has both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols (hydroxyl groups, -OH).\n    *   Ketone reduction: R-CO-R' → R-CD(OH)-R'\n    *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CD₂OH\n    The final product would be a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups), for example, HO-CD₂-R'-CD(OH)-R. This molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states to sum the masses of *all* instances of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The molecule contains one atom of aluminium. The mass number of the most stable isotope of aluminium (²⁷Al) is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Final Sum:** Sum of the two cumulative masses = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances involved.**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W.** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): D is an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely to be formed in the context of the other clues)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O). (Fits)\n\n    *   **Clue 2: The reaction.** \"Substance X... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". The release of D₂ gas strongly suggests a reaction between a deuterated reducing agent (a metal deuteride) and a proton/deuteron source like water or heavy water.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Substance B.** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   Therefore, substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance G.** Since heating the precipitate G releases D₂O (B), G is likely a metal deuteroxide (the deuterated analog of a metal hydroxide), which decomposes upon heating. For example, M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n2.  **Propose a candidate for Substance X.**\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The organic chemistry context.** \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" and \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Let's consider common deuterated reagents. Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and its analog, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), are extremely common and powerful reducing agents. NaBD₄/NaBH₄ is another pair.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is famous for reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH). A keto acid contains both functional groups. The reduction of a keto acid (like pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH) with LiAlH₄ (or LiAlD₄) followed by workup yields a diol (like 1,2-propanediol, CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ as Substance X. The reaction would be with heavy water (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. Let's assume Y is D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. (Checks out)\n    *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate. (Checks out)\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) gives aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. (Checks out)\n    *   The melting point of B (D₂O) is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   The organic chemistry reaction with a keto acid makes sense. (Checks out)\n\n    All clues point strongly to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" implies we sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements within the molecule's formula. We will use the integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n        *   Sum = (Mass from lightest element) + (Mass from heaviest element)\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substances X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze common gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   Other gases like N₂ (14p, 14n), O₂ (16p, 16n), CO (14p, 14n) also fit this criterion, but the clue about a \"heavier isotope\" strongly points towards Deuterium (D). So, we can hypothesize **W = D₂**.\n\n    *   **Substance X and Reaction:** Substance X contains a \"heavier isotope,\" which we now suspect is Deuterium (D). It reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce D₂. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen (or its isotope) is the reaction of a hydride with water.\n        *   The phrase \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n        *   The \"close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n        *   To produce pure D₂ gas from LiAlD₄, the other reactant (liquid Y) must also be a source of deuterium atoms. The most common liquid that fits this is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   This reaction is analogous to the violent reaction of LiAlH₄ with H₂O. It produces D₂ gas (W). So, we can tentatively identify **Y = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces a precipitate G. In the products `LiOD + Al(OD)₃`, LiOD is soluble, but Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, is insoluble, just like its analog Al(OH)₃.\n        *   G (Al(OD)₃) is heated and releases B. When Al(OH)₃ is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OH)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`.\n        *   By analogy, `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So, substance **B = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   The problem states the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let's convert this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The actual melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is a very strong confirmation of our identifications.\n\n    *   **Confirmation with the Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (>C=O) -> Secondary alcohol (>CHOH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) (1 oxygen)\n        *   The final product is a diol, which contains a total of 2 oxygen atoms. This matches the clue perfectly and rules out milder reagents like NaBD₄ (which wouldn't reduce the carboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X.**\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently conclude that **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation.**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n        *   Lightest element (by atomic number and mass): Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n        *   Heaviest element (by atomic number and mass): Aluminium (Al).\n\n    *   **Interpret the Calculation Instructions:** The question includes a critical clause: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n        *   This clause tells us how to calculate the mass contribution for each element.\n        *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are **four instances** in the formula LiAlD₄. Therefore, we must sum the masses of all four Deuterium atoms.\n        *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is only **one instance**.\n\n    *   **Calculate:** We will use integer mass numbers, as the options are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the main isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × (mass of a D atom) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium) = 1 × (mass of an Al atom) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n\n        *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling, common in chemistry, often involving deuterium (D, or ²H) as a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 2: Melting point of B is ~277 K.** The Kelvin scale is used. 277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This implies that G is a deuterated hydrate, most likely a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₓ), which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n    *   **Clue 4: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** The reaction is violent and produces a gas, which is characteristic of reactive hydrides/deuterides with a protic substance like water.\n    *   **Clue 5: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's consider some simple gases.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Yes.**\n        *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. No.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible, but less likely from the context.\n        Given that D₂O is involved, the most plausible gas is D₂.\n    *   **Clue 6: Reconstructing the reaction.** If the gas W is D₂, it must be formed from a reaction involving deuterium. A simple way to produce D₂ is to react a deuteride (a compound containing D⁻ ions or polarized D atoms) with a deuterium source like heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n        The reaction would be: `Substance X (a deuteride) + D₂O (liquid Y) -> D₂ (gas W) + M(OD)ₓ (precipitate G)`. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 7: Identifying Substance X.** We have two more clues for X.\n        *   \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This strongly points to common reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄. Both are common reagents.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (and therefore LiAlD₄) reduce both functional groups to alcohols. A ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OH), and a carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂-OH). The starting keto acid has two oxygen atoms, and the resulting product, a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), also has two oxygen atoms. This reaction works with LiAlD₄ but not with weaker hydrides.\n    *   **Conclusion for X:** All clues converge on **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   It contains a heavy isotope (D).\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a major organic reagent.\n        *   It reacts violently with D₂O (Y) to produce D₂ (W) and Al(OD)₃ (part of G). `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`. Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G.\n        *   Heating Al(OD)₃ gives Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n        *   It reduces a keto acid to a diol, preserving the number of oxygen atoms (two).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We compare the elements by atomic number or atomic mass to find the lightest and heaviest.\n        *   Li: Z=3, Mass ≈ 7 amu\n        *   Al: Z=13, Mass ≈ 27 amu\n        *   D (isotope of H): Z=1, Mass ≈ 2 amu\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to calculate the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D = ²H (mass = 2) and Al = ²⁷Al (mass = 27).\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen/Deuterium): There are four D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = Mass from Al + Mass from D = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Isotope:** The clue states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the heavy isotope involved is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W is released from a reaction involving deuterium. The clue states its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   A Deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release D₂ (gas W) and form a precipitate G. Since deuterium is involved, it is highly probable that liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is `X + D₂O → D₂ + G`. This is characteristic of a metal deuteride reacting with heavy water, analogous to a metal hydride reacting with normal water (e.g., `NaH + H₂O → H₂ + NaOH`).\n    *   The precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a metal deuteroxide, as heating a metal hydroxide often yields a metal oxide and water. For example, `Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + D₂O`.\n\n4.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clues to Identify X:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To get a product with only 2 oxygens, a powerful reduction must occur, converting both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohol groups (`R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`).\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common, powerful reducing agent. The most famous one is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   The deuterated analog of LiAlH₄ is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits all the criteria:\n        *   It contains the heavy isotope Deuterium.\n        *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a staple in organic chemistry.\n        *   It is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing a keto acid to a diol.\n        *   Its reaction with heavy water is violent: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`. Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a precipitate.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (`Al(OD)₃`) releases D₂O (B).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 amu = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (present as 1 atom). The mass of one aluminum atom is approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 amu = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass** = (Total mass from Al) + (Total mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35 amu.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe step-by-step thinking process has led to the identification of the substances and the final calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is ~3.85 °C. This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, indicating that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance Y, G, and the Reaction Type:** Since B (D₂O) is produced by heating a precipitate G, G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating. G is formed in a reaction between substance X and a liquid Y. Given that all products contain deuterium, the liquid reactant **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is violent, suggesting X is a highly reactive substance.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released from the reaction and its molecules have an equal number of neutrons and protons. The reaction is between a deuterated substance X and D₂O. The most plausible gaseous product is a form of hydrogen.\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Unequal)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule, therefore, has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Thus, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We now know that X reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a metal deuteroxide precipitate (G). This is the characteristic reaction of a metal deuteride.\n    *   `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`\n    *   The clue about organic chemistry provides the final piece. \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. Reducing it to a product with 2 oxygens requires reducing the carboxylic acid group, a reaction that needs a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent. Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope (deuterium) is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`. This matches all observations: it's a violent reaction, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G), which upon heating gives D₂O (B).\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass:** The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄. It contains one Aluminum atom and four Deuterium atoms.\n    *   We use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum atom (²⁷Al) = 27 u.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium atom (²H) = 2 u.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.** This immediately suggests isotopic labeling. A very common example in chemistry is replacing Hydrogen (H, protium) with its heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gases (W):\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   N₂ (Nitrogen gas): The most common isotope, ¹⁴N, has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This also fits.\n        *   CO (Carbon Monoxide): Using common isotopes ¹²C (6p, 6n) and ¹⁶O (8p, 8n), a CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This also fits.\n        The D₂ option seems most promising because it aligns with Clue 1.\n    *   **Clue 4, 5, & 6: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n        *   The proximity of B's melting point to that of D₂O is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   **Connecting the dots so far:** If B is D₂O, then G must be a deuterated compound that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide like M(OD)ₓ decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. If B is D₂O and W is D₂, it strongly reinforces the idea that Substance X is a deuterated compound.\n    *   **Clue 7 & 8: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.**\n        *   A keto acid has two functional groups containing oxygen: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   A reaction with X reduces the number of oxygen atoms to 2. This can happen if the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        *   The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very powerful reducing agent. The most common one in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a \"heavier isotope\" would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Let's check this hypothesis: LiAlD₄ reduces a keto acid (R-CO-R'-COOH) to a diol (R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH). The final product has two oxygen atoms. This fits perfectly. NaBH₄ (and NaBD₄) is another common reducing agent, but it's not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, so it's not a candidate.\n\n2.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Let's assume **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a common reagent. (Checks out)\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope, D. (Checks out)\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid to give a product with 2 oxygens. (Checks out)\n    *   Now, let's check its reaction with \"liquid Y\". Given the production of D₂O, the most logical candidate for Y is D₂O itself.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4 D₂↑\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As established, it has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Checks out)\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is insoluble in water/D₂O and would precipitate. (Checks out)\n    *   **Heating G:** When you heat G (Al(OD)₃), it decomposes: 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O.\n    *   **Substance B:** The substance released is D₂O, whose melting point is ~277 K. (Checks out)\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   To find the lightest and heaviest, we compare their atomic masses. For isotopes, we use the specific mass of that isotope, not the periodic table average.\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (²H or D) ≈ 2 u\n        *   Mass of Lithium (most stable isotope, ⁷Li) ≈ 7 u\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (most stable isotope, ²⁷Al) ≈ 27 u\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   The problem asks for the *cumulative* mass, considering all instances. The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium) = 4 × (mass of one D atom) ≈ 4 × 2 = 8 u.\n    *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × (mass of one Al atom) ≈ 1 × 27 = 27 u.\n    *   Sum of these masses = 8 u + 27 u = 35 u.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35. This matches option C.\n\nTo confirm with more precise values:\n*   Mass of ²H (Deuterium) ≈ 2.014 u\n*   Mass of ²⁷Al ≈ 26.982 u\n*   Total mass from D = 4 * 2.014 u = 8.056 u\n*   Total mass from Al = 1 * 26.982 u = 26.982 u\n*   Sum = 8.056 + 26.982 = 35.038 u. This is extremely close to 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Decoding the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n    *   277 Kelvin is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, this means heating the precipitate G releases D₂O. This is characteristic of a deuterated hydrate, most likely a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating.\n    *   For example: M(OD)n --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms.\"**\n    *   We know the reaction involves deuterium (from D₂O). This makes it highly likely that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is deuterium (D).\n    *   Let's analyze possible candidates for gas W (equal protons and neutrons):\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Protons = 1+1=2; Neutrons = 1+1=2. This fits.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): Protons = 7+7=14; Neutrons = 7+7=14. This fits.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon monoxide): Protons = 6+8=14; Neutrons = 6+8=14. This fits.\n    *   Considering the context (D₂O is produced), a reaction producing D₂ gas is the most logical choice for W.\n    *   The overall reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate). Since G is a metal deuteroxide and D₂ is produced, a plausible reaction is the violent reaction of a metal deuteride (X) with heavy water (Y).\n    *   Reaction scheme: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W).\n    *   For a precipitate (G) to form, the metal deuteroxide must be insoluble. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a known gelatinous precipitate. This suggests that Substance X contains aluminum.\n    *   A common and powerful deuteride reagent containing aluminum is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verifying LiAlD₄ with the remaining clues.**\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) reacts with D₂O (Y).\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate G) + 4D₂ (gas W)`\n    *   This reaction is notoriously violent. It produces D₂ gas (W), which has equal protons and neutrons. It forms a precipitate, Al(OD)₃ (G). Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) produces Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). This hypothesis fits all the chemical reaction clues perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group (3 oxygen atoms in total).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups.\n        *   Ketone reduction: -C(=O)- → -CD(OH)-\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: -COOH → -CH₂OH\n        *   So, the keto acid R-C(=O)-COOH is reduced to the diol R-CD(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product contains two hydroxyl (-OH) groups, and therefore **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n    *   **Clue 6: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**\n        *   X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminum Hydride).\n        *   LiAlH₄ is an extremely common, powerful, and important reducing agent used extensively in organic chemistry. LiAlD₄ is its deuterated version used for isotopic labeling. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Mass**\n\n*   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄:**\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, Atomic Number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (lowest Z) is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (highest Z) is **Aluminium**.\n\n*   **Sum the masses of these elements as they appear in the formula:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses, considering all instances of the elements. We will use integer masses (mass numbers) as the options are integers.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula contains four atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The formula contains one atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its most stable isotope is 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n*   **Calculate the final sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W's Properties:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple gaseous molecules.\n        *   Hydrogen (H2): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   Nitrogen (N2): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible.\n        *   Deuterium (D2): Deuterium (D) is a heavy isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D2 molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   This clue strongly suggests the involvement of Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and Isotopes:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". This aligns perfectly with the idea that Gas W is D2, meaning Substance X contains Deuterium (D).\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X and Y:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". A classic violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Since D2 is produced, a plausible scenario is a metal deuteride (Substance X) reacting with water (Liquid Y). A very powerful reagent that fits this description is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4). Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   Proposed X = LiAlD4\n        *   Proposed Y = H2O (a common liquid)\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD4 + 4H2O → LiOH + Al(OH)3 + 4D2\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent, produces D2 gas (our identified Gas W), and proceeds with water (a liquid, Y).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Precipitate G and Substance B:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   In our proposed reaction (LiAlD4 + 4H2O), Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is formed, which is a well-known white precipitate. So, **G = Al(OH)3**.\n        *   When Aluminum Hydroxide is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OH)3(s) --(heat)--> Al2O3(s) + 3H2O(g). The substance released is water, H2O. So, **B = H2O**.\n        *   The melting point of water is 0 °C, which is 273.15 K. The value 277 K (3.85 °C) is stated to be \"very close\", which confirms that B is water.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Organic Chemistry Context:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4) is a famous and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated version, LiAlD4 (our proposed Substance X), is its \"very close analog\" and is also used. This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   Keto acids contain both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). They have at least 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH4 (and LiAlD4) reduces both functional groups to alcohols: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n        *   The final product is a diol (contains two alcohol groups, -OH). A diol has exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms the chemical identity of X.\n\n2.  **Conclusion of Identification**\n\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently identify the substances:\n    *   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4)\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Water (H2O)\n    *   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D2)\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH)3)\n    *   **Substance B:** Water (H2O)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value**\n\n    The question asks to \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD4\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number or atomic mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element and Aluminum is the heaviest.\n    *   **Sum the masses as instructed:** The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we need the total mass contribution of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in one formula unit. We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved (D=2, Al=27).\n\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative (Summed) Mass:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine potential simple molecules:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ⁴He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes, but unlikely product of a violent chemical reaction).\n        *   D₂O (heavy water vapor): 10 protons (2 from D, 8 from O), 10 neutrons (2 from D, 8 from O-16). (Yes).\n        *   The release of a hydrogen-like gas (D₂) is a very common pattern in reactions of active hydrides/deuterides.\n\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\".\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is extremely close to 277 K. This is a strong indicator that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Precipitate G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\".\n        *   The thermal decomposition of a substance to yield water (or in this case, heavy water) is characteristic of a hydroxide (or deuteroxide). For example, heating a metal hydroxide M(OH)ₓ produces the metal oxide and water.\n        *   Therefore, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating: `M(OD)x -> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B)`.\n        *   Since G is a precipitate, the metal deuteroxide must be insoluble. This rules out alkali metals like Na, K, and Li, as their hydroxides are very soluble. It suggests metals like Mg, Ca, Al, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue about the Reaction:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G\".\n        *   We have G = M(OD)ₓ. This deuteroxide is formed in the reaction. This implies that the solvent, Y, must be the source of the OD groups, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction is: `X + D₂O (Y) -> W (gas) + M(OD)x (G, precipitate)`.\n        *   If X were a simple metal, the gas released would be D₂. For example: `Ca + 2 D₂O -> Ca(OD)₂ + D₂`. This is a plausible path.\n        *   However, we have stronger clues pointing to another identity for X.\n\n    *   **Clues about Substance X:**\n        *   \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\": This is consistent with containing Deuterium (D).\n        *   \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\": This points towards a common reagent.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\": A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A product with 2 oxygen atoms suggests a reduction reaction that converts the keto acid to a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This requires a powerful reducing agent, much stronger than a simple metal like Ca.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Propose the Identity of X**\n\n    *   A very common, powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n        *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4 D₂ (gas)`\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas is D₂. As determined earlier, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The precipitate is Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Aluminium hydroxide is a known gelatinous precipitate, so this fits.\n        *   **Heating G to get B:** Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause dehydration: `2 Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. The released substance B is D₂O.\n        *   **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. This fits perfectly.\n        *   **Keto acid reaction:** LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into a diol, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.

This is the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The standard water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible, but inert).\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each deuterium (D or ²H) atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n    *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n    *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Possible).\n    Given that D₂O is involved (from step 1), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is `Substance X + Liquid Y -> Gas W + Precipitate G`.\n    *   We've deduced W is likely D₂. To produce D₂ gas, both the reactant X and the liquid Y must be sources of deuterium atoms. If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction with a deuteride (like M-D) would produce HD gas (`M-D + H₂O -> M-OH + HD`), which has 2 protons and 1 neutron, not matching the properties of W.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction must be between a deuterated substance X and heavy water Y. So, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: `X (a deuteride) + D₂O -> D₂ + G`.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   X is a deuterated substance that reacts violently with D₂O.\n    *   X and its non-deuterated analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   This points towards complex metal hydrides like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is known to react *violently* with water, while NaBH₄'s reaction is much milder. The \"violent\" reaction clue strongly favors **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's check the rest of the clues with X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate G. Aluminium deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is the deuterated analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. This fits perfectly. In contrast, the product from NaBD₄ would be B(OD)₃ (deuterated boric acid), which is soluble and not a precipitate.\n    *   The precipitate G (Al(OD)₃), when heated, releases B. The decomposition is `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B (D₂O), which matches our initial finding.\n    *   The final clue is about the reaction with a keto acid. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. A keto acid (like pyruvic acid, R-CO-COOH) would be reduced to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). The product contains two oxygen atoms, which matches the clue.\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   For this type of problem, we use the mass numbers of the most common or relevant isotopes:\n        *   Deuterium (D, or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (⁷Li is the most common isotope): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminium (²⁷Al is the only stable isotope): Mass number = 27\n    *   Comparing the masses: D (2) < Li (7) < Al (27).\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium (Al)**.\n    *   The question states: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all atoms of the identified lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   4 atoms of the lightest element (D).\n        *   1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Number of D atoms × Mass of D) + (Number of Al atoms × Mass of Al)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27)\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"**: This is a strong hint towards a deuterated compound, where Deuterium (D or ²H) replaces Hydrogen (H or ¹H).\n\n    *   **\"reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\"**:\n        *   Let's identify Gas W. We need a simple molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.\n            *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n            *   HF: H (1p, 0n) + F (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Yes)\n            *   N₂: Each N (7p, 7n) = 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n            *   CO: C (6p, 6n) + O (8p, 8n) = 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   Given the first clue about a heavier isotope, D₂ is the most likely candidate for Gas W. This implies that Substance X is a deuteride. The violent reaction suggests liquid Y is likely water (H₂O).\n\n    *   **\"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\"**: This points towards a common reagent. If X is a deuteride, a very common analog would be a hydride. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits perfectly.\n\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\"**:\n        *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits this clue.\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both functional groups to alcohols.\n        *   Ketone (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-).\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n        *   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). A diol contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue strongly supports X being LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **\"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\"**:\n        *   Let's write the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with Y (H₂O):\n            `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH(aq) + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`\n        *   In this reaction, the gas W is D₂, which we already established.\n        *   A precipitate G, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃), is formed. This fits.\n        *   When precipitate G (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes:\n            `2Al(OH)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3H₂O(g)`\n        *   The reaction *releases* a substance B. So, B is water (H₂O).\n        *   The melting point of water is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. The clue states the melting point of B is \"very close to 277 K\" (4°C). This is a reasonable approximation for a puzzle-style question (it might also be an oblique reference to the temperature of water's maximum density).\n\n2.  **Conclusion on Substance X:**\n    All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   First, identify the elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄):\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number (Z) = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number (Z) = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), represented by its isotope Deuterium (D), Atomic Number (Z) = 1\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements based on their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (Z=1)\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Z=13)\n    *   Calculate the total mass for each of these elements in the molecule using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes present.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass:\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Hydrogen isotopes) + (Mass from Aluminum isotopes)\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:** The gas W released has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider some simple molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n        *   ²H₂ or D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). This is a strong candidate, especially given the next clue.\n        *   ⁴He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p=n). Unlikely to be a product of a violent chemical reaction.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p=n). Possible, but less likely in this context.\n        *   The clue that \"Substance X ... incorporat[es] a heavier isotope\" strongly suggests we are dealing with deuterium (D or ²H). Therefore, **Gas W is most likely D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** Precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This is the characteristic melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Thus, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue about Precipitate G:** Since heating G produces D₂O, G must be a compound that contains deuterium and oxygen and is thermally unstable. A common example is a metal deuteroxide, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O. For G to be a precipitate, the corresponding metal hydroxide must be insoluble in water. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **G is likely Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide)**.\n\n    *   **Putting it all together to identify X and Y:**\n        *   We have a reaction where Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and Al(OD)₃ precipitate.\n        *   `X + Y → D₂(g) + Al(OD)₃(s)`\n        *   For the products to contain D, Al, and O, the reactants X and Y must supply these elements. The reaction releases D₂, so X is likely a deuteride (a compound containing D⁻ ions). Since the precipitate is Al(OD)₃, X must contain aluminum. A compound containing both aluminum and deuterium is aluminum deuteride or a complex deuteride.\n        *   The most common and highly reactive reagent fitting this description is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Its reaction with heavy water (D₂O) would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD`\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and an Al(OD)₃ precipitate (G). The other product, LiOD, is soluble. This scenario perfectly fits all the clues. Thus, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Verify with the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" LiAlD₄ (X) and its analog LiAlH₄ are both powerful reducing agents widely used in organic synthesis. This confirms our identification.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" An α-keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone (C=O) group and the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The product is a diol, R-CD(OD)-CD₂OD (after D₂O workup), which contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This clue further solidifies that **X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements within the molecule.\n    *   The atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element: Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element: Hydrogen, as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   Now, we sum the masses as requested:\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (H) = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X and related compounds.**\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting Point of B.** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (277 K = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), while normal water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This is a strong indication that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The heavier isotope mentioned in the first sentence is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when a precipitate G is heated. This is characteristic of the dehydration of a metal hydroxide. Since the final product is D₂O, the precipitate G must be a deuterated hydroxide, like M(OD)n. The heating reaction would be: `2 M(OD)n → M₂On + n D₂O`.\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X with Y.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and a gas W. Given that G is a deuterated hydroxide, it's formed from the reaction of a highly reactive substance X with deuterated water (D₂O). So, **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction would be: `X + D₂O → G (M(OD)n) + W (gas)`.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** The gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine the reaction `X + D₂O`. If X is a metal deuteride, the gas produced would be D₂.\n        *   Let's check D₂ (Deuterium gas): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n    *   **Clue 5: Substance X Identity.** We know X is a deuteride that reacts with D₂O to form a deuterated hydroxide and D₂ gas. We also know that X and its analog are used in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, used for isotopic labeling, is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is violent. It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), and a gas, D₂. Heating the precipitate Al(OD)₃ gives Aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). This is fully consistent with all the clues.\n    *   **Clue 6: Keto Acid Reaction.** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce a keto acid (which has a ketone group, -CO-, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH) to a hydroxy acid (e.g., R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass.**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** We compare the mass of a single atom of each element (using the mass number of the most common/relevant isotopes).\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (²H): 2 amu\n        *   Mass of Lithium (⁷Li): 7 amu\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (²⁷Al): 27 amu\n        *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Deuterium (D)** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present... considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four atoms of Deuterium in LiAlD₄. The total mass is 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum:** Summing these two values gives: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer.**\n    The calculated cumulative mass is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This strongly suggests a compound where a common element is replaced by its heavier isotope. In organic and inorganic chemistry, the most common example is the replacement of hydrogen (¹H) with deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This indicates a very reactive substance X and a protic (or in this case, deuterated) solvent Y.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released, with an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's consider simple diatomic gases.\n        *   H₂ (Protium gas): Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit).\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton, 1 neutron. D₂ molecule has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (This fits perfectly).\n        *   N₂: Each ¹⁴N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons. N₂ molecule has 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (This also fits).\n        *   However, the release of D₂ gas is much more consistent with a deuterated reagent reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   **Clue 4: The reaction is between X and liquid Y, producing gas W (D₂).** For X to produce D₂, it must be a deuteride (D⁻) donor. For Y to react and form D₂, it must be a deuterium cation (D⁺) source. The most common liquid source of D⁺ is heavy water, D₂O. The reaction would be D⁻ + D⁺ → D₂. This reaction is known to be violent for strong deuteride donors. So, let's hypothesize **Y = D₂O** and **W = D₂**.\n    *   **Clue 5: A precipitate G forms, which releases B upon heating.** Many metal hydrides react with water to form metal hydroxides, which are often insoluble (precipitates). By analogy, a metal deuteride would react with heavy water to form a metal deuteroxide. For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Many metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. So, G would be a metal deuteroxide, and upon heating, it would release heavy water (B).\n    *   **Clue 6: B has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The provided search information confirms the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B = D₂O**. This confirms our earlier hypotheses that Y is D₂O and G is a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 7: X and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.** We are looking for a powerful deuteride reducing agent whose hydride analog is very common. The two most prominent hydride reducing agents are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). LiAlH₄ is known for its extremely violent reaction with water, which fits the description well.\n    *   **Clue 8: The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group, for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) is a very strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both functional groups.\n        *   Ketone (R₂C=O) → Secondary alcohol (R₂CH-OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (R-COOH) → Primary alcohol (R-CH₂OH)\n        *   Therefore, reacting a keto acid (3 oxygens) with LiAlD₄ would reduce both groups, resulting in a diol (a compound with two alcohol groups, e.g., R-CH(OD)-CH₂(OD)). The final product contains **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and Perform Calculation:**\n    *   Based on all the evidence, Substance X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses of the specific isotopes involved. We use the mass number (protons + neutrons).\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): 1 proton + 1 neutron = Mass 2\n        *   Lithium (Li): The most abundant stable isotope is ⁷Li.

Mass = 27\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (mass 2).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (D): There are four D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of Al) + (Mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The calculated cumulative mass is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to identify the substances involved.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This is a strong hint towards isotopic labeling, most commonly with Deuterium (D or ²H), which is a heavy isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This suggests a highly exothermic reaction, typical of strong reducing agents, alkali metals, or metal hydrides with a protic substance like water.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released, and its molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes. This fits perfectly with Clue 1.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes.\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes.\n        *   Given Clue 1, D₂ is the most probable candidate for gas W.\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G is formed.** The reaction produces an insoluble solid.\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B.** This means G decomposes upon heating.\n    *   **Clue 6: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This is the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 7: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has two oxygen-containing functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For the final product to have only two oxygens, both groups must have been reduced to alcohols (-OH). This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Clue 8: Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points to a common laboratory chemical.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n\n    *   From Clues 3 & 6, we have identified **W = D₂** and **B = D₂O**.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is released from heating G, and the overall reaction involves deuterium, G must be a deuteroxide compound that dehydrates (or \"de-deuterates\") upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n`.\n    *   Let's test a hypothesis. The \"very close analog\" (Clue 8) of a common strong reducing agent (Clue 7) is a good starting point. The most common strong reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope (Clue 1) would be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Now, let's see if this hypothesis fits all other clues.\n        *   **Reaction with liquid Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts extremely violently with water. So, LiAlD₄ would react violently with heavy water (D₂O). Let's assume **Y = D₂O**. The reaction would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes.\n        *   **Releases gas W (D₂)?** Yes.\n        *   **Forms precipitate G?** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, aluminium deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would also be a precipitate. This fits perfectly. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   **Heating G releases B (D₂O)?** The decomposition of aluminium hydroxide is `2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`. So, the decomposition of G would be `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. This also fits perfectly.\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid?** LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. A keto acid `R-C(=O)-COOH` would be reduced to a diol `R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`. This final product contains exactly **two oxygen atoms**. This fits Clue 7 perfectly.\n    *   The hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** is consistent with every single clue provided.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n    *   The question specifies: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This is a key instruction.\n    *   For the lightest element (Hydrogen), there are 4 instances (four D atoms). We must sum their masses.\n    *   For the heaviest element (Aluminium), there is 1 instance.\n    *   We will use the mass numbers (the integer sum of protons and neutrons) for the calculation, as is standard for this type of problem and because the answers are integers.\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminium (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 aluminium atom. Total mass = 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total cumulative mass:** Sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This points towards elements like hydrogen (Deuterium, D), carbon (¹³C), etc.\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** A violent reaction with a liquid (often water) is characteristic of highly reactive hydrides or similar compounds.\n    *   **Clue 5 & 6: G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O**, confirming that the heavy isotope from Clue 1 is Deuterium (D).\n    *   If heating G produces D₂O, then G must be a deuterated hydrate or a compound that decomposes to yield D₂O, like a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 3 Revisited: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze some potential gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1) (Yes)\n        *   N₂: 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7) (Yes)\n        *   C₂H₄: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (Yes)\n        Given that Deuterium is central to the problem, **W = D₂** is the most plausible candidate.\n    *   **Clue 8: X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This strongly suggests common laboratory reagents, very likely reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) or Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 7: The reaction product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH. Powerful reducing agents like LiAlH₄ reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reaction `R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent]` yields a diol, `R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)`. This product molecule contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction with Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. If we assume Y is D₂O (heavy water) to produce D₂ gas, the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes decomposition into the metal oxide and water. So, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases **B = D₂O**, which matches our finding from its melting point.\n    *   All clues fit perfectly with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   (Alternative check: If X were NaBD₄, the reaction `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O -> NaBO₂ + 4D₂` produces the right gas (D₂) but Sodium Metaborate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate G would form. This rules out NaBD₄).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the **cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)**. We should use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number (Z) or atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the molecule:** The formula is LiAlD₄.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is **one** atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: The Melting Point of B**\n    The substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where D is Deuterium (²H), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 4: Formation of B from G**\n    Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating to yield D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` might decompose to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 1, 2, and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Since D₂O is a product down the line, this heavier isotope is almost certainly **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   This reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's analyze potential gases (W). Given that Deuterium is involved, let's check hydrogen isotopes:\n        *   H₂ (normal hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n        *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n        *   **D₂ (dideuterium)**: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Fits perfectly!)\n    *   For the reaction to produce D₂ gas, both reactants should ideally be rich in Deuterium. So, X is a deuterated compound, and Y is likely D₂O. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   We are looking for a common deuterated organic reagent that reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)- and -COOH groups, for a total of at least 3 oxygen atoms) is reduced by X to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies the reduction of both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups (e.g., R-C(=O)-R'-COOH → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH), which has two -OH groups, hence 2 oxygens).\n    *   Common reducing agents are NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄. NaBH₄ is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. LiAlH₄ (lithium aluminum hydride) is a very powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. Its analog is **LiAlD₄ (lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Heavy isotope:** Yes, it contains Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Organic reagent:** Yes, LiAlH₄ is a very common reagent, and LiAlD₄ is its well-known analog used for isotopic labeling.\n        *   **Reaction with Y = D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent. The same applies to LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n        *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide), which is insoluble and forms a precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃.\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum deuteroxide would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B = D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reduction:** LiAlD₄ is strong enough to reduce a keto acid to a diol, changing the oxygen count from 3 to 2. This fits.\n\n    All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1, present as isotope D), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄. We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   We use integer atomic mass numbers for this calculation, as is standard for such problems and suggested by the integer options.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), with a mass number of **2**.\n        *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of **27**.\n    *   The molecule LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen, as D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum). Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = (Total mass of D) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (deuterium oxide), which is 3.82 °C or 276.97 K. This is a strong clue that we are dealing with deuterium. Normal water (H₂O) melts at 273.15 K (0 °C), which is not as close.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine possible diatomic gases related to the context:\n    *   H₂ (molecular hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (molecular deuterium): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (p = n).\n    This confirms that the gas W is D₂.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** For the reaction to produce pure D₂ gas, both the reagent (X) and the protic solvent it reacts with (Y) must contain only deuterium, not protium (normal hydrogen). Therefore, liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O). Substance X must be a deuterated reagent. The problem mentions X and its analog are used in organic chemistry and that the reaction is violent. This points towards a powerful deuterated reducing agent. The two most common are Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n4.  **Differentiate between LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄:** The reaction between X and Y (D₂O) forms a precipitate G. Let's write the reactions:\n    *   `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    *   `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → Al(OD)₃(s) + LiOD(aq) + 4D₂(g)`\n    Sodium borate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate forms. However, aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will precipitate. This means G is Al(OD)₃, and **Substance X must be LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify with other clues:**\n    *   **Heating G:** The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃. When heated, metal hydroxides (and deuteroxides) decompose. `2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g)`. This releases substance B, which we identified as D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   **Keto acid reaction:** The problem states \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" LiAlD₄ is a very strong reducing agent. It can reduce both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A typical α-keto acid has the structure R-CO-COOH (containing 3 oxygen atoms). LiAlD₄ would reduce it to a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. This is also consistent.\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   This means we must sum the mass of the single Aluminium atom and the four Deuterium atoms in the LiAlD₄ molecule.\n    *   Since the answer options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27.\n    *   The isotope Deuterium is ²H, with a mass number of 2.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B and Liquid Y.**\n    The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This value is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n    Substance B (D₂O) is released when precipitate G is heated. This means G is a deuterated compound, likely a metal deuteroxide that loses D₂O upon heating.\n    The overall reaction involves Substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and gas W. Since the products (G and B) contain deuterium (D), the liquid reactant Y must be the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Gas W.**\n    Gas W is released from the reaction of X and Y (D₂O). The clue is that a molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze possible gases from a reaction involving a deuteride and D₂O.\n    The reaction would produce hydrogen gas. The isotopes could be H or D.\n    *   H₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per H), 0 neutrons. Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    *   D₂ molecule: 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Protons = Neutrons.** This fits the description.\n    *   HD molecule: 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n    Therefore, **Gas W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Substance X and Precipitate G.**\n    We know that X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G.\n    X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas)\n    The clue \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common reducing agents like Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The \"heavier isotope\" version would be Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    Let's test X = LiAlD₄.\n    The reaction with D₂O is:\n    LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃, is the precipitate G**. This is consistent because aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O, releasing D₂O (Substance B), which matches our deductions.\n    If we tested X = NaBD₄, the products would be NaOD and B(OD)₃. Boric acid and its deuterated analog are soluble in water, so no precipitate would form. Thus, X cannot be NaBD₄.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the identity of X with the final clue.**\n    The clue states: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both functional groups to alcohols (or deuterated alcohols, \"deuterols\").\n    R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → (workup) → R-CH(OD)-CD₂(OD)\n    The final product is a diol (an alcohol with two hydroxyl groups, or in this case, deuteroxyl groups). It contains **two oxygen atoms**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\n    The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we must account for all atoms of hydrogen and aluminum in the formula.\n    *   We use integer atomic masses for the calculation, as the options are integers. Mass(Deuterium, D) = 2 amu. Mass(Aluminum, ²⁷Al) = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × Mass(D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × Mass(Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Final Calculation:** The cumulative sum is the sum of these two values.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This suggests isotopic labeling.\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance B's melting point is ~277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue 3: The heavy isotope is Deuterium (D).** Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 4: Analysis of the reaction.**\n        *   Substance X (containing D) reacts violently with liquid Y.\n        *   A precipitate G is formed.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O). This implies G is a compound that can be dehydrated (or \"de-deuterated\"), such as a metal hydroxide (or in this case, a metal deuteroxide). For example, a metal deuteroxide M(OD)ₓ when heated would yield a metal oxide and D₂O.\n        *   For G to be a metal deuteroxide, liquid Y must be the source of the OD group, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n        *   A gas W is released, and its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider the reaction between a metal deuteride (a plausible form for X) and heavy water (Y). For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Let's check the gas **W = D₂**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   So far, we know X is a substance containing a metal and deuterium. The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate).\n    *   **Clue 5: X or its analog is a reagent in organic chemistry.** The most common hydride reagents (whose deuterated analogs are also used) are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated versions are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test these candidates:\n        *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. However, both sodium deuteroxide (NaOD) and boric acid (B(OD)₃) are soluble in water. No precipitate (G) would form. This contradicts the clues.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate**. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Clue 6: Heating G releases B.** If G is Al(OD)₃, heating it would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (B), which also matches the clues.\n    *   **Clue 7: The keto acid reaction.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (R-C(=O)-COOH). Substance X (LiAlD₄) and its analog LiAlH₄ are powerful reducing agents that would reduce both functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This final clue confirms our identification.\n\n3.  **Conclusion: Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule.

The mass number of deuterium is 2.\n        *   Total mass from hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass from aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated above.\n        *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance B:**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    *   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is significantly different from that of regular water (H₂O), which is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   However, this is the characteristic melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G and B:**\n    *   The problem states that precipitate G, when heated, releases B.\n    *   Since B is D₂O, G must be a compound that contains D₂O, likely a deuterated hydrate (a \"deuterate\"), which decomposes upon heating to release D₂O. A common example would be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction to identify Y and W:**\n    *   The main reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G.\n    *   Since G is a deuterated compound (M(OD)n), it's highly likely that the reactant, Liquid Y, was the source of deuterium, meaning **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is violent: X + D₂O → W(g) + G(ppt). This suggests X is a highly reactive substance with water, like an alkali metal, a metal hydride, or a similar reactive species.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine candidates for W, assuming it's formed from X reacting with D₂O.\n        *   A likely product from such a reaction is hydrogen gas. If the reactants contain deuterium, the gas would be D₂.\n        *   Let's check D₂: A deuterium atom (D, or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂(g) and a precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n    *   We are also told that X, and \"especially its very close analog,\" is a common reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards reagents like LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄. The \"analog\" would be the regular hydrogen version (e.g., LiAlH₄), and substance X would be its deuterated form.\n    *   Let's test **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** as Substance X. Its analog, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very powerful and common reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   Let's check if this fits all the clues:\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. The reaction with D₂O would be similarly violent.\n        *   **Gas W?** The reaction produces D₂, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G?** The reaction produces Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Thus, Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G releases B?** Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes it to decompose into the metal oxide and water (or heavy water). `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This reaction releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n        *   **Reaction with a keto acid?** A keto acid has the structure R-C(=O)-COOH and contains 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups to alcohols. The product would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This final product molecule contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This crucial clue fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity:**\n    All the evidence points to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n    *   The question specifies summing the masses of *all* atoms of these elements in the formula. We will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved (D = ²H, and the most stable isotope for Al, which is ²⁷Al).\n    *   **Lightest element (Hydrogen):** It is present as the isotope Deuterium (D). Its mass number is 2. There are four D atoms in the formula LiAlD₄.\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminum):** It is present as the isotope ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** Sum the total masses calculated above.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from D) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong indication that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Trace the origin of B:** Substance B (D₂O) is released when a precipitate G is heated. This is a classic dehydration/de-deuteration reaction. This implies that G is a deuterated hydrate or a deuterated hydroxide, which loses D₂O upon heating. For example, a metal hydroxide M(OH)n when heated gives a metal oxide and H₂O. Similarly, M(OD)n would give a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)n**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to form the precipitate G and a gas W.\n    *   X + Y → G (precipitate) + W (gas)\n    *   Since G contains Deuterium (D), either X or Y (or both) must contain D. The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope, which we've identified as D.\n    *   A violent reaction releasing a gas and forming a hydroxide precipitate is characteristic of a reactive metal or metal hydride reacting with water.\n    *   If G is M(OD)n, then the reaction medium Y must be the source of the OD groups. This makes **liquid Y heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n4.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, produced in the reaction, has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze potential gases from the reaction of a deuterated compound (X) with heavy water (Y=D₂O).\n    *   If X were, for instance, a deuteride like CaD₂, the reaction would be CaD₂ + 2D₂O → Ca(OD)₂ + 2D₂.\n    *   Let's check the gas **D₂ (di-deuterium)**. A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This fits the description of W.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have gathered several clues about X:\n    *   It contains Deuterium (D).\n    *   It is a common reagent in organic chemistry, with a \"very close analog\" that is also used. This points towards pairs like LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ or NaBH₄/NaBD₄.\n    *   It reacts violently with D₂O to produce a precipitate G (a metal hydroxide) and D₂ gas.\n    *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride)**. Its analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and powerful reducing agent.\n        *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   This reaction is famously violent.\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W), which we confirmed has N=P.\n        *   It produces a precipitate, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble. This fits. Sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄) would produce soluble sodium borate, so it's a less likely candidate.\n    *   The final clue is about the reaction with a keto acid. A keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group (e.g., R-C(=O)-COOH), containing 3 oxygen atoms. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ will reduce both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains only 2 oxygen atoms. This clue confirms that X is a strong reducing agent.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use integer mass numbers for the most common/relevant isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (²H or D), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). The most common isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   The formula unit is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass contribution from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is one atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass contribution from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are four atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The cumulative (summed) mass is the sum of these two values: 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X:** Contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Reacts violently. Is a reagent in organic chemistry, with a close analog.\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Reacts violently with X.\n    *   **Gas W:** Released during the reaction. A key property is that its molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Forms during the reaction.\n    *   **Substance B:** Released when G is heated. Has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of reacting a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze Gas W and Substance B:**\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K (277 - 273.15 ≈ 3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). So, **B is D₂O**.\n    *   Since B (D₂O) is produced by heating the precipitate G, it implies the heavy isotope present in the system is Deuterium (D).\n    *   Now let's analyze Gas W, whose molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's test common diatomic gases.\n        *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **Yes, this fits.**\n        *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes, but less likely to be produced from this type of reaction.\n        *   HF: 10 protons (9 from F, 1 from H), 10 neutrons (10 from F, 0 from H). **Yes, this also fits.**\n    *   Given that the system clearly involves Deuterium (from B = D₂O), the most logical conclusion is that **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction and Substances X and Y:**\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    *   The release of D₂ gas from a reaction suggests that either X or Y must be a source of deuterium.\n    *   The most common violent reactions that release hydrogen gas involve reactive metals or metal hydrides with water.\n    *   Let's propose a reaction scheme:\n        *   Scheme 1: X (a deuteride compound) + Y (H₂O). Example: CaD₂ + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + 2HD. The gas produced is HD (2p, 1n), which doesn't fit the p=n rule for gas W. So this is incorrect.\n        *   Scheme 2: X (a reactive substance) + Y (D₂O). Example: Metal + D₂O → Metal Deuteroxide + D₂. This fits perfectly. The gas W is D₂, and the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   So, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    *   We also know G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a metal deuteroxide decomposing: M(OD)ₓ → Metal Oxide + D₂O. This confirms that **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X is a substance used in organic chemistry, has a close analog, and reacts violently with D₂O to form a metal deuteroxide precipitate. This strongly points to a powerful reducing agent, specifically a complex metal hydride. The most common one that fits this description is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄, which means Substance X, containing a heavier isotope (D), must be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's verify this choice against all clues:\n        *   **Heavier isotope:** Yes, Deuterium (D).\n        *   **Reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O):** Yes. The reaction is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas). It's famously violent.\n        *   **Gas W with p=n:** Yes, D₂ is produced.\n        *   **Precipitate G forms:** Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is a gelatinous precipitate.\n        *   **G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O) on heating:** Yes. 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n        *   **Keto acid reaction:** A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) is reduced by LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH). This product contains **2 oxygen atoms**, which matches the clue.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Z(H)=1, Z(Li)=3, Z(Al)=13.\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers, as is standard for this type of problem and implied by the integer answer choices.\n        *   Mass number of the Deuterium isotope (D or ²H) = 2.\n        *   Mass number of the Aluminum isotope (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   There are **four** atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as D).\n    *   Total mass from lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is **one** atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = (Total mass from lightest) + (Total mass from heaviest) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to solve the identity of Substance X.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.** This is a direct hint that we are dealing with a compound containing an isotope like Deuterium (D), ¹³C, ¹⁵N, etc.\n\n    *   **Clue 6: The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.** 277 Kelvin is 3.85°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope Deuterium, is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an extremely strong match.\n        *   Therefore, **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n        *   This confirms the heavier isotope mentioned in Clue 1 is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).** This means G is a deuterated hydrate, i.e., a compound that has D₂O molecules in its structure or, more likely, a metal deuteroxide that dehydrates upon heating to form a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` would decompose upon heating: `2M(OD)n -> M₂On + nD₂O`.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Since D₂O is involved, it's highly probable that the liquid **Y is also D₂O**.\n        *   Let's analyze potential gases (W) with equal protons (p) and neutrons (n):\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D has 1p and 1n. D₂ has **2p and 2n**. This is a perfect candidate.\n            *   Nitrogen gas (¹⁴N₂): Each ¹⁴N has 7p and 7n. N₂ has **14p and 14n**. This is possible.\n            *   Carbon monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. CO has **14p, 14n**. This is possible.\n        *   A reaction between an unknown substance X and D₂O that produces D₂ gas is very common for metal deuterides: `MDx + xD₂O -> M(OD)x + xD₂`. This reaction type fits the clues. The \"violently\" part suggests a very reactive deuteride.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms.** In the reaction `MDx + xD₂O -> M(OD)x + xD₂`, the product **G would be the metal deuteroxide, M(OD)x**. For G to be a precipitate, M(OD)x must be insoluble in D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 8: Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.** This is a huge hint. Powerful reducing agents used in organic chemistry often come in deuterated forms for isotopic labeling studies. Common examples include Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   **Clue 7: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Both functional groups are reduced by strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄.\n        *   Ketone: `>C=O` is reduced to `>CH-OH`.\n        *   Carboxylic acid: `-COOH` is reduced to `-CH₂-OH`.\n        *   So, a keto acid is reduced to a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). The resulting diol molecule still contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms X is a powerful reducing agent.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test our two main candidates, LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   **Candidate 1: LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`.\n        *   *Violent?* Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is famously violent.\n        *   *Gas W?* D₂ is produced.\n        *   *Precipitate G?* Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃.\n        *   *G → B?* Heating `2Al(OD)₃` gives `Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. So B=D₂O.\n        *   *Organic Reagent?* Yes, LiAlD₄ and its analog LiAlH₄ are cornerstone reducing agents.\n        *   This is a perfect fit for all clues.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: NaBD₄ (Sodium Borodeuteride)**\n        *   **Reaction with D₂O:** `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂↑`.\n        *   *Violent?* The reaction of NaBH₄ is much milder and more controllable than LiAlH₄. This doesn't fit the \"violently\" clue as well.\n        *   *Precipitate G?* The products are NaOD (soluble) and B(OD)₃ (boric acid, soluble). It does not form a classic precipitate.\n        *   Since NaBD₄ does not fit the \"violently\" and \"precipitate\" clues as well as LiAlD₄, we can confidently eliminate it.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Substance X is LiAlD₄.**\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". In puzzles of this nature, \"atomic mass\" usually refers to the integer mass number of the most common/relevant isotope.\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest:**\n        *   Hydrogen (Atomic number Z=1) is the **lightest element**.\n        *   Aluminium (Atomic number Z=13) is the **heaviest element**.\n        *   Lithium (Z=3) is an intermediate element and should be ignored based on the phrasing of the question.\n\n    *   **Calculate Masses:**\n        *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula LiAlD₄ contains 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all as the Deuterium (D) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium (1 proton + 1 neutron) is 2.\n          *Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 atoms × 2 = 8.*\n        *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** The formula contains 1 atom of Aluminium. The only stable isotope of Aluminium is ²⁷Al. Its mass number is 27.\n          *Total mass from Aluminium = 1 atom × 27 = 27.*\n\n    *   **Sum the masses:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminium)\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is my reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify the Reactants and Products**\n\n1.  **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**: This tells us Substance X is a deuterated or otherwise isotopically labeled compound. The heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is the most common heavy isotope used in chemical synthesis.\n\n2.  **\"...reacts violently with liquid Y...\"**: This suggests a very energetic reaction, typical of highly reactive species like alkali metals or powerful hydrides with a protic solvent like water.\n\n3.  **\"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**: Let's analyze potential simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **(p = n)**. This is a perfect match. So, **W = D₂**.\n    *   C₂H₂ (Acetylene): 8 protons, 6 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   C₂D₂ (Deuterated Acetylene): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. **(p = n)**. This is another possibility.\n\n4.  **\"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**:\n    *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82°C).\n    *   The value 277 K is a clear indicator that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   Since precipitate G releases D₂O upon heating, G must be a deuterated hydroxide or a hydrate containing D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide: `M(OD)n --(heat)--> MxOy + D₂O`.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Chemical Reaction and Identify Substance X**\n\n*   We know the reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G) which can be heated to form D₂O (B).\n*   Let's synthesize these facts:\n    `Substance X + Liquid Y → D₂(g) + G(s)`\n    `G(s) --(heat)--> ... + D₂O(l)`\n*   For D₂ gas to be a product, the reactants must provide the deuterium. Since X contains the heavy isotope, it's the source of 'D'. Since G yields D₂O, Liquid Y must also be a source of 'D' and 'O'. This makes **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n*   Now the reaction is: `X + D₂O → D₂(g) + G(s)`.\n*   This means X reacts with D₂O to liberate D₂. This happens when X is a source of a reduced species that can be oxidized by D₂O's deuterium (D⁺). Hydride (H⁻) is a perfect candidate. So X is likely a metal hydride. Since X contains deuterium, it must be a metal **deuteride**.\n*   Let's consider common deuteride reagents used in organic chemistry, as hinted by the last clues. The most powerful and common are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n*   **Let's test X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Clue: \"...and its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**: The analog is LiAlH₄, a ubiquitous reducing agent. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction with D₂O**: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`.\n        *   Reacts violently? Yes.\n        *   Releases D₂ gas (W)? Yes.\n        *   Forms a precipitate G? Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide, **G = Al(OD)₃**, would precipitate.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O)? `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. Yes. This fits all the clues.\n    *   **Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**: A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols, yielding a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n*   All evidence strongly points to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks to \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X... if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved: Li is mostly ⁷Li, Al is ¹⁰⁰% ²⁷Al, and the hydrogen is specified as the heavier isotope D (²H).\n    *   Mass Number (Li) = 7\n    *   Mass Number (Al) = 27\n    *   Mass Number (D) = 2\n*   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements**:\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (H)\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al)\n*   **Calculate the total mass from each of these elements in the formula LiAlD₄**:\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Al): There is one atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass from lightest element (H): There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all in the form of Deuterium (D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass**:\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Al) + (Total mass from H/D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope:** This immediately brings to mind deuterium (D or ²H), a common heavy isotope of hydrogen used in chemical synthesis.\n    *   **X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W:** This suggests a very reactive substance, like an active metal hydride, reacting with a protic solvent like water.\n    *   **Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons:** Let's analyze potential gases.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Matches, but He is inert and an unlikely product of a violent reaction.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Protons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 1 (from D) + 1 (from D) = 2. This is a perfect match and consistent with X containing deuterium. So, **W is D₂**.\n    *   **X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry:** This points towards common deuterated reagents. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent, and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), is also widely used. Let's hypothesize that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Reaction and Precipitate G:** If X is LiAlD₄, it reacts violently with water. To produce D₂ gas, the source of all the deuterium must be from the reactants. The reaction must be with a deuterated solvent. Let's assume Liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but aluminum hydroxide (and its deuterated version) is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**. This fits the description.\n    *   **Precipitate G, when heated, releases B, with melting point ~277 K:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes dehydration.\n        *   `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`\n        *   So, substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C, which is 273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K. This value is extremely close to 277 K. This clue strongly confirms our identifications. **B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups to alcohols.\n        *   `R-C(=O)-COOH` (3 oxygens) + LiAlD₄ --> (after workup) --> `R-CD(OH)-CH₂(OH)` (a diol, with 2 oxygens).\n        *   The product has 2 oxygen atoms, which matches the problem description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Identity of Substance X**\n\n    All clues consistently point to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are:\n        *   Lithium (Li), Atomic Number = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al), Atomic Number = 13\n        *   Hydrogen (H), present as its isotope Deuterium (D), Atomic Number = 1\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question further specifies: \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all the atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   Let's use integer atomic masses for simplicity, which is sufficient for multiple-choice questions.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H or D) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   4 atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium).\n        *   1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\n    *   Now, we sum the masses as instructed:\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8\n        *   Cumulative (total) mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"** This strongly suggests a common reagent where hydrogen has been replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are frequently used in organic chemistry. Their deuterated analogs, Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), are also common for isotopic labeling. So, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: \"Reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"**\n        *   Metal hydrides and deuterides react violently with water. Let's assume Y is water. If it's normal water (H₂O), the reaction with LiAlD₄ would produce a mix of gases (H₂, HD, D₂). If the liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is:\n            LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   Let's analyze the gas produced, W = D₂ (Deuterium gas).\n        *   A single deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A molecule of D₂ therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the clue that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. This supports the idea that X is a deuteride and Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n\n    *   **Clue 3: \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**\n        *   From the reaction above, the products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n        *   When metal hydroxides/deuteroxides are heated, they decompose to the metal oxide and water/heavy water.\n            2 Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g)\n        *   The substance *released* is B, which must be the volatile D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   We deduced B is D₂O. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This confirms that B is D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   A keto acid has a general structure R-(C=O)-R'-COOH. It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones (>C=O) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alcohols (-CH(OH)-) and (-CH₂OH), respectively. NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n        *   The reaction R-(C=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH results in a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n        *   This confirms that X must be the more powerful reducing agent, LiAlD₄, rather than NaBD₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Elements and Their Masses:**\n\n    *   Based on the analysis, **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride).\n    *   The elements present in the molecule are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n    *   To find the lightest and heaviest elements, we compare their atomic masses (or simply their position in the periodic table).\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): An isotope of Hydrogen (Z=1). Mass number = 2.\n        *   Lithium (Li): (Z=3). Atomic mass ≈ 7 u.\n        *   Aluminium (Al): (Z=13). Atomic mass ≈ 27 u.\n    *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Deuterium (D)** and the **heaviest element is Aluminium (Al)**.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". This means we must sum the mass of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element found in one formula unit of LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers, which is standard for this type of problem and aligns with the integer answer choices.\n    *   **Heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is one atom of Al in LiAlD₄. Its mass number is 27.\n        *   Mass from Al = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four atoms of D in LiAlD₄. The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Mass from D = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative (total) mass:**\n        *   Total = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: Melting Point of B**\n    *   The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, Deuterium Oxide) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues 4 and 5: Precipitate G and Substance B**\n    *   Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of the thermal decomposition of a deuterated metal hydroxide, which would yield a metal oxide and heavy water.\n    *   `Metal(OD)x --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B)`\n    *   This means the precipitate **G is a metal deuteroxide**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clues 2 and 3: The Reaction of X and Y**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and the precipitate G.\n    *   Since the products (G) contain deuterium, the reactants (X and/or Y) must also contain deuterium.\n    *   The clue states X incorporates a \"heavier isotope.\" This confirms X contains deuterium.\n    *   Let's analyze Gas W: \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   Deuterium atom (D): 1 proton, 1 neutron.\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This is a perfect candidate for W.\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, a deuteride (Substance X) must react with a deuterium source (Liquid Y). The most plausible candidate for a liquid deuterium source that would react violently with a reactive deuteride is heavy water itself.\n    *   So, we can deduce: **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction is between Substance X (a deuteride) and D₂O.\n    *   Example reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G) + D₂ (W)`\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 7 and 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   Clue 8 states that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents rather than simple binary compounds. Strong reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) are widely used. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Clue 7 states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄ (or its analog LiAlD₄) reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone reduction: R-C(=O)-R' → R-CH(OH)-R' (1 oxygen).\n        *   Carboxylic acid reduction: R-COOH → R-CH₂OH (1 oxygen).\n        *   Therefore, the reduction of a keto acid by substance X produces a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This reaction chemistry is a perfect match for **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride**. Its non-deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   Thus, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Entire Reaction**\n    *   X = LiAlD₄\n    *   Y = D₂O\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n    *   Gas W = D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons). Check.\n    *   Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide). Check.\n    *   Heating G: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This produces B=D₂O. Check.\n    *   Melting point of B ≈ 277K. Check.\n    *   All clues are consistent with X = LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄). We will use integer mass numbers as the options are integers.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest element** (by atomic number) is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   **Heaviest element** (by atomic number) is **Aluminium**.\n    *   The question states, \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most common and stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses from the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n    This also means the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is Deuterium (D or ²H). Therefore, Substance X must contain Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W.**\n    The gas W, released in the reaction, has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some small gas molecules that could be formed:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Contains two Deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, the D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. (p=n). This is a perfect match.\n    *   N₂: Contains two ¹⁴N atoms. Each has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n    *   CO: Contains ¹²C (6p, 6n) and ¹⁶O (8p, 8n). The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is also a possibility.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X.**\n    We know X contains Deuterium (D) and reacts to produce D₂ gas. It is also mentioned that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common deuterated reagents.\n    Let's consider powerful reducing agents, as they can react with certain substances to produce hydrogen (or deuterium) gas.\n    A prime candidate is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This fits the clue.\n    *   It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium. This fits the clue.\n\n4.  **Verify the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is LiAlD₄.\n    X (LiAlD₄) reacts \"violently with liquid Y\" to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G.\n    LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be analogous and violent. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established in step 2, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. Thus, **Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G**. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Aluminum hydroxide is heated, it decomposes to aluminum oxide and water (2 Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O). Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield B (D₂O): 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. We already identified B as D₂O. This confirms the reaction sequence.\n\n5.  **Verify the final clue.**\n    \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group (3 oxygen atoms total).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    Having confidently identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**, we can perform the calculation.\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, in the form of Deuterium isotope D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula. We will use integer atomic masses (mass numbers) as suggested by the integer options.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula contains four atoms of Hydrogen, specifically the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The formula contains one atom of Aluminum. The most common stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C). However, the clue mentions \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\". This strongly suggests we are dealing with heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O). The melting point of D₂O is 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to 277 K.\n        *   **Conclusion:** **B is D₂O (Heavy Water)**.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** The release of water (or heavy water) upon heating is characteristic of the decomposition of a hydrate (or in this case, a \"deuterate\"). The substance G must be a metal hydroxide-d, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** Let's assume Substance X is a common reducing agent used in organic chemistry that incorporates a heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium, D). Prime candidates are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). The \"very close analog\" mentioned in another clue would be LiAlH₄ or NaBH₄, both standard reagents.\n        *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄**. It's known to react violently with protic substances. If it reacts with D₂O (heavy water), the reaction would be:\n            `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n            *   **Liquid Y:** Y would be D₂O. This is consistent.\n            *   **Precipitate G:** The product Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide) is the heavy-water analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a known precipitate. When heated, Al(OD)₃ would decompose to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (Substance B). This fits perfectly.\n            *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂ (dideuterium). Let's check its neutron and proton count. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the clue that the number of neutrons and protons is the same.\n        *   This hypothesis (X=LiAlD₄, Y=D₂O, W=D₂, G=Al(OD)₃, B=D₂O) works for all clues so far.\n\n    *   **Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   **Reasoning:** A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH). Substance X, LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄), is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both the ketone to a secondary alcohol (>CH-OD) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OD). The final product, a diol, has only 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X is a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Final Identification of Substance X**\n\n    *   All the evidence points to Substance X being **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value**\n\n    *   **Question:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X...\"\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:** We compare the elements by their atomic mass (or mass number, as the options are integers).\n        *   Hydrogen (H/D): Mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Lithium (Li): Mass number of the common isotope is 7.\n        *   Aluminum (Al): Mass number of the only stable isotope is 27.\n        *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as D).\n        *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Al).\n\n    *   **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative mass, summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule.\n        *   **Mass from heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n        *   **Mass from lightest element (H/D):** There are four atoms of Deuterium. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection**\n\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Gas W:** The first critical clue is that gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's consider simple diatomic gases.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Total: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Protons ≠ Neutrons).\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each D (²H) has 1 proton, 1 neutron. Total: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Protons = Neutrons). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   Let's consider another possibility, Deuterated Ammonia (ND₃), as it can be formed from nitrides reacting with heavy water. For ¹⁴N, we have 7 protons and 7 neutrons. For D, we have 1 proton and 1 neutron. In ND₃, Total protons = 7 + 3*(1) = 10. Total neutrons = 7 + 3*(1) = 10. (Protons = Neutrons). So, W could be D₂ or ND₃.\n\n2.  **Analyze Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C).\n    *   This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This confirms that the reaction involves deuterium and that substance B is D₂O.\n    *   Substance G is a precursor to B, formed as a precipitate. When heated, it releases D₂O. This suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide (a compound that forms a hydroxide precipitate which can then be dehydrated/de-deuterated). For example, `M(OD)n --(heat)--> Oxide + D₂O`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Reaction and Identify X:**\n    *   The reaction is `X + Y -> W (gas) + G (precipitate)`. We know B=D₂O, and G releases B, and Y is a liquid. The source of all the deuterium must be from X and/or Y. Since B is D₂O, it makes sense that the liquid Y is also D₂O.\n    *   **Path 1: W = D₂.** The reaction `X + D₂O -> D₂ + G (precipitate)` is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n    *   **Path 2: W = ND₃.** The reaction `X + D₂O -> ND₃ + G (precipitate)` would require X to be a metal nitride (e.g., Mg₃N₂). `Mg₃N₂ + 6D₂O -> 2ND₃ + 3Mg(OD)₂`. G would be Mg(OD)₂, which fits. However, the first clue states that \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". Metal nitrides like Mg₃N₂ don't inherently contain an isotope. This clue points to X itself being the deuterated compound, making Path 1 far more likely.\n\n4.  **Focus on Path 1 (W = D₂):** We are looking for a substance X which is a deuteride, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O.\n    *   A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry that fit this description are complex metal hydrides, and their deuterated analogs. The prompt specifically mentions that \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\".\n    *   Let's consider Lithium Aluminium Deuteride, LiAlD₄. Its analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic synthesis.\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ against all clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: Contains deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. **✓**\n        *   **Y = D₂O** (heavy water).\n        *   **Reaction**: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`. This is a known, violent reaction.\n        *   **Gas W**: D₂. We confirmed this has equal protons and neutrons. **✓**\n        *   **Precipitate G**: Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. This is a precipitate. **✓**\n        *   **Heating G**: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. It releases D₂O. **✓**\n        *   **Substance B**: D₂O, whose melting point is ~277 K. **✓**\n        *   **Reaction with keto acid**: LiAlD₄ (like LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups. The resulting product, a diol, will contain two oxygen atoms. **✓**\n        *   **Organic Chemistry Reagent**: The analog LiAlH₄ is a cornerstone reagent. **✓**\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity of X:** All evidence points conclusively to Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (as Deuterium).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all Aluminium atoms and all Deuterium atoms in one molecule of LiAlD₄.\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the most common/stable isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminium (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there is **one** Al atom and **four** D atoms.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of Al) + 4 * (Mass of D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 4 * (2)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X** contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its close analog. Its reaction with a keto acid produces a compound with 2 oxygen atoms. This strongly suggests X is a deuterated reducing agent, like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). The corresponding common analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄. The reduction of a keto acid (R-CO-COOH, 3 oxygens) by these agents typically yields a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, 2 oxygens) or a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH, 3 oxygens for NaBH4 and 2 for LiAlH4 after acidic workup). The product containing 2 oxygens fits well with a powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ or its deuterated version.\n\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Reacts violently with X.\n    *   **Gas W:** Released during the reaction. A key property is that its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons (N=P).\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Forms during the reaction.\n    *   **Substance B:** Released when G is heated. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This melting point is famously that of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope in Substance X must be Deuterium (D, or ²H). This confirms X is a deuterated compound.\n    *   G releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, as metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. For example, `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. So, G is probably a deuterated metal hydroxide precipitate.\n    *   The reaction `X + Y -> W + G` must form this deuterated hydroxide. This means the metal must come from X and the oxygen must come from Y.\n    *   Let's test the potential candidates for X.\n        *   If X = NaBD₄, the metal is Boron. Boron hydroxides or borates formed (like Na[B(OD)₄]) are generally soluble, which contradicts the formation of a precipitate G.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄, the metals are Lithium and Aluminum. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate. This makes LiAlD₄ a very strong candidate for X.\n\n3.  **Identify the Full Reaction:**\n    *   Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   To form G = Al(OD)₃, X must react with a source of \"OD\" groups. The simplest and most direct way to do this is to react it with **Y = D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   Let's write the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   Now, let's check if this reaction satisfies all the clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: A deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, a common organic reagent. (Check)\n        *   **Y = D₂O**: A liquid. (Check)\n        *   **Violent reaction?**: LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. LiAlD₄'s reaction with D₂O is analogous and also violent. (Check)\n        *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**: Al(OD)₃ is a solid precipitate. (Check)\n        *   **G --(heat)--> B = D₂O**: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases D₂O. (Check)\n        *   **Gas W = D₂**: Let's check the proton/neutron count for a deuterium molecule (D₂). Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons** and **2 neutrons**. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. (Check)\n\n    *   The proposed reaction system (X=LiAlD₄, Y=D₂O) perfectly matches all the details given in the problem.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question states that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\". We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n        *   **For the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of hydrogen in the molecule, all of which are the heavy isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. So, the total mass contribution from the lightest element is `4 atoms * 2 = 8`.\n        *   **For the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of aluminum in the molecule. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is 27. The total mass contribution from the heaviest element is `1 atom * 27 = 27`.\n    *   The **cumulative atomic mass** is the sum of these two values: `8 + 27 = 35`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X** contains a heavier isotope of an element.\n    *   X reacts violently with liquid **Y**.\n    *   This reaction produces a gas **W**. A molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   A precipitate **G** is formed.\n    *   Heating G releases substance **B**.\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its reaction with a keto acid yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X has a \"very close analog\" also used in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:**\n    The crucial clue is that gas W has an equal number of protons (p) and neutrons (n). Let's examine common diatomic gases using the most common isotopes:\n    *   H₂ (¹H): 2p, 0n. No.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O): 16p, 16n. Yes.\n    *   CO (¹²C, ¹⁶O): 14p, 14n. Yes.\n    *   NO (¹⁴N, ¹⁶O): 15p, 15n. Yes.\n\n    However, the clue about the \"heavier isotope\" strongly suggests we should consider isotopes. Let's look at hydrogen's heavier isotope, Deuterium (D or ²H), which has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   **D₂ (²H₂):** Each atom has 1p, 1n. The D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the condition perfectly and incorporates the \"heavier isotope\" clue. This is a very strong candidate for W.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance B:**\n    The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   277 Kelvin is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an almost exact match. So, **B is heavy water, D₂O.**\n\n4.  **Identify Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   If gas W is D₂ and B is D₂O, it strongly implies a reaction system involving deuterated compounds.\n    *   Let's hypothesize X is a deuteride reagent. A common class of such reagents are complex metal hydrides used for reduction in organic chemistry. A powerful one is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated version would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" would be LiAlH₄, a staple in organic chemistry labs. This fits the clue.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents. If B (D₂O) is produced by heating G, it's likely that the initial liquid reactant, Y, was also D₂O. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with D₂O, so **Y is D₂O.**\n    *   Let's write the reaction:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)\n    *   In this reaction, Aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is insoluble in water and would form a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃.**\n    *   Now, let's check if heating G (Al(OD)₃) produces B (D₂O):\n        2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)\n    *   This decomposition reaction is correct.\n\n5.  **Confirm with the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n    *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols (-CH(OH)-) and carboxylic acids to primary alcohols (-CH₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms our identification of X as a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Solve the Final Calculation:**\n    *   **Substance X is LiAlD₄.**\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its heavier isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses (mass numbers) of the most common/relevant isotopes:\n        *   Li: ⁷Li (mass ≈ 7)\n        *   Al: ²⁷Al (mass = 27)\n        *   D: ²H (mass = 2)\n    *   Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by mass:\n        *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (as Deuterium), mass = 2\n        *   Heaviest element: Aluminum, mass = 27\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses\" of these elements in the molecule, specifying that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD₄.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Sum of these cumulative masses:**\n        Sum = (Total mass of H) + (Total mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated sum is 35, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82°C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope in X:** Since D₂O is involved, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the description of Substance X is **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. A molecule of W contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   Let's test some simple gases.\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   HD (Hydrogen deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Incorrect)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 from each D), 2 neutrons (1 from each D). (Correct)\n    *   Thus, gas **W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    *   The reaction of X and Y produces D₂ gas. Since X contains deuterium, it must be a deuteride compound. For D₂ to be produced, the other reactant, Y, must also be a source of deuterium. The most logical candidate for liquid Y is D₂O (the same as substance B).\n    *   The reaction of a deuteride with heavy water is violent. The clue \"Substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards a common reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a prime candidate. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It releases D₂ gas (W), which matches our finding.\n    *   It forms two products in the solution: LiOD (soluble in D₂O) and Al(OD)₃ (aluminum deuteroxide). Al(OD)₃ is the deuterium analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate. So, the precipitate **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O, which is substance B.\n    *   All these points are consistent.\n\n5.  **Verify with the final clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), for a total of 3 oxygen atoms in the simplest structures (e.g., Pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n    *   R-CO-COOH (keto acid, 3 oxygens) --[1. LiAlD₄] / [2. Workup]--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (a diol, 2 oxygens).\n    *   This reaction results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms, confirming our identification.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing the masses of all their atoms present in the molecule. We will use the integer mass numbers for the calculation, as is standard for such problems leading to integer answers.\n    *   Mass number of Deuterium (D) = 2.\n    *   Mass number of Aluminum's most stable isotope (²⁷Al) = 27.\n    *   There are 4 atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) in LiAlD₄. Their total mass is 4 * 2 = 8.\n    *   There is 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum) in LiAlD₄. Its mass is 1 * 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" 277 Kelvin is 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K), but heavy water (D₂O) melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\". Since we've identified B as D₂O, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen. Therefore, **Substance X must contain Deuterium**.\n    *   **Clue 5 & G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\". Heating metal hydroxides (M(OH)ₙ) typically yields a metal oxide and water (H₂O). By analogy, heating a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₙ) would yield a metal oxide and heavy water (D₂O). So, **G must be a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   **Clue 3 & W:** \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium, let's consider deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. Thus, **W is very likely D₂ gas**.\n    *   **Clue 2, 8, 9 & X:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry, and it reacts with a keto acid. These properties strongly point towards powerful reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Since X contains deuterium, the candidates are their deuterated analogs: lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBD₄).\n    *   **The Reaction:** Let's test the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a suitable liquid Y that would produce the identified products. The most logical reaction to produce D₂ gas is the reaction of the deuteride with heavy water (D₂O), which would also be the source for the deuteroxide precipitate.\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Validation of the Reaction:**\n        *   This reaction is known to be extremely violent. (Matches clue 2)\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble), aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate), and deuterium gas (D₂). This matches the formation of precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃** and gas **W = D₂**.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces **B = D₂O**.\n        *   The analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry. (Matches clue 9)\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) would reduce the keto group to a deuterated alcohol (R-CD(OH)-COOH). The product contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), meaning it has 2 oxygen atoms. (Matches clue 8)\n\n    *   Based on all the clues, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope has a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (H). Its isotope in the molecule is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of 2. There are four D atoms in the formula.\n    *   The term \"cumulative atomic masses\" and \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed\" means we need to sum the mass of the single Al atom and the four D atoms.\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n    *   Using integer mass numbers for the calculation: Sum = 27 + (4 × 2)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Identify Gas W and Substance B:**\n    1.  The problem states that gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze common diatomic gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas, a heavier isotope of hydrogen): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Thus, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect fit.\n    2.  This suggests that Substance X contains deuterium (D).\n    3.  Substance B has a melting point of approximately 277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match. Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Identify the Reaction and Substances X, Y, and G:**\n    1.  Substance G releases D₂O (B) when heated. This implies G is a deuterated hydroxide (like M(OD)x) or a deuterated hydrate.\n    2.  Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas D₂ and a precipitate G. A common violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Given the presence of deuterium everywhere, it is logical to assume the reaction is between a metal deuteride (X) and heavy water (Y).\n    3.  Reaction: `Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → Metal Deuteroxide (G, precipitate) + D₂ (W, gas)`.\n    4.  So, **Y is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n*   **Use the Organic Chemistry Clue to Identify X:**\n    1.  \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points to a common reagent.\n    2.  \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, one oxygen must be removed. This happens when a carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol (`-COOH` -> `-CH₂OH`).\n        *   Therefore, X must be a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids. The most common reagents for this are lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), with LiAlH₄ being much stronger and necessary for reducing carboxylic acids.\n    3.  The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since X incorporates a heavier isotope (Deuterium), **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Verify the Reaction with LiAlD₄:**\n    1.  Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD (soluble) + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    2.  This reaction is known to be violent.\n    3.  It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    4.  It produces a gelatinous precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (G).\n    5.  When G is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    6.  All clues fit perfectly.\n\n*   **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    1.  Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    2.  The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    3.  The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    4.  The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    5.  The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms**: There is one atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). Its mass is 27 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms**: There are four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). Each has a mass of approximately 2 amu. The total mass is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    6.  Cumulative Mass = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical properties and reactions described, we can deduce the identities of the substances involved.\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B:** The melting point of Substance B is given as \"very close to 277 K\". Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This temperature is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** The problem states that Gas W's molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". The reaction involves a deuterated compound (implied by the presence of D₂O). Let's examine possible hydrogen-based gases:\n    *   H₂: Contains 2 protons (1 from each H) and 0 neutrons. Does not match.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Contains 2 protons (1 from each D) and 2 neutrons (1 from each D). This matches the description.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance Y:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂. For D₂ to be produced, the reaction likely involves two sources of deuterium. Since Substance X is a deuterated compound and B is D₂O, the most plausible identity for the liquid reactant Y is also **heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n4.  **Identification of Substance X:** We are looking for a deuterated compound that is a common organic reagent, reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (G). Let's test Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), the deuterated analog of the common reducing agent LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4D₂↑`\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It produces D₂ gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (Substance G).\n    *   When heated, the precipitate G decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases substance B (D₂O).\n    *   The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with X produces a molecule with 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid into alcohol groups, resulting in a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as 4 atoms of Deuterium, D).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminium (present as 1 atom of Al).\n    *   We use the mass numbers for the specific isotopes: D has a mass number of 2; the common isotope of Al has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Mass of all lightest element atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of all heaviest element atoms = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The nature of substance B.**\n    *   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This temperature is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C. However, it is almost identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O or ²H₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently identify **B as D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of gas W.**\n    *   \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   Since the system clearly involves deuterium (from the identification of D₂O), let's examine hydrogen and its isotopes as components of the gas.\n    *   H₂ (Protium): Each ¹H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Does not fit)\n    *   HD (Protium-Deuterium): ¹H has (1p, 0n), ²H has (1p, 1n). HD molecule has 2 protons, 1 neutron. (Does not fit)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium): Each ²H has 1 proton, 1 neutron. D₂ molecule has **2 protons, 2 neutrons**. (This fits the condition).\n    *   While other gases like ¹⁴N₂ (14p, 14n) or ¹²C¹⁶O (14p, 14n) also fit this numerical criterion, the presence of D₂O elsewhere in the reaction system makes D₂ the most chemically consistent candidate for gas W.\n    *   So, we identify **W as D₂ (di-deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Identify G, X, and Y.**\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W (D₂) + Precipitate G.\n    *   Also, heating G releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, 2M(OD)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3D₂O. The fact that a precipitate forms suggests a metal hydroxide that is insoluble, such as Al(OH)₃ or Mg(OH)₂.\n    *   Let's consider **G = Al(OD)₃** (aluminum deuteroxide), as Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Heating it would give: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This is consistent.\n    *   Now, we can assemble the reaction: X must contain Al and D. The reaction produces D₂ gas and a precipitate of Al(OD)₃ after reacting with liquid Y. To provide the oxygen and the extra deuterium for the products, Y must be D₂O.\n    *   The full reaction is: X + D₂O → D₂ + Al(OD)₃ + [soluble byproduct].\n    *   Let's look at Clue 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a famous, powerful reducing agent. Its \"close analog\" incorporating a \"heavier isotope\" (Clue 1) is **Lithium aluminum deuteride, LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the reaction:\n        **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD**\n    *   This is a known violent reaction. All components match our deductions:\n        *   X = LiAlD₄ (contains heavier isotope D).\n        *   Y = D₂O (liquid).\n        *   W = D₂ (gas with equal protons and neutrons).\n        *   G = Al(OD)₃ (precipitate). Heating gives D₂O.\n        *   B = D₂O.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Final Clue (Clue 7).**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a ketone group (-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-R'-CD₂OH.\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". This means we sum the mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements in one molecule of X.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are **4** atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is **1** atom of Aluminum. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (total) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Liquid Y**\n- The problem states that a gas W is released whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n- Let's analyze some simple molecules:\n    - H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Not equal)\n    - **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Equal)\n    - He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Equal, but a noble gas, unlikely to be a product of a violent reaction).\n    - **HF (Hydrogen Fluoride):** H (1p, 0n) + F-19 (9p, 10n) = 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (Equal)\n- The problem also states that a precipitate G is formed, which upon heating releases substance B. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This is very close to the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C or 276.97 K). This strongly suggests that B is D₂O.\n- If the reaction releases D₂O, it's highly likely that deuterated compounds are involved. Specifically, if B is D₂O, the reacting liquid Y is almost certainly D₂O as well, which acts as the solvent and reactant.\n- If Y is D₂O, and the reaction is with substance X, the gas released (W) must be D₂. The reaction cannot produce HF if there is no Fluorine source. This confirms W = D₂, and the reaction involves deuterium transfer.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X**\n- Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y (D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a reactive metal deuteride.\n- The prompt says, \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards deuterated versions of common reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), or simpler hydrides like Lithium Hydride (LiH). The \"analog\" would be the standard hydrogen version.\n- The next clue is: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    - A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-(...)-COOH. It contains at least three oxygen atoms.\n    - To get a product with only two oxygen atoms, both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced.\n    - LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids (to alcohols). The product of reducing a keto acid would be a diol, R-CH(OH)-(...)-CH₂OH, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n    - NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent that typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be R-CH(OH)-(...)-COOH, which still has three oxygen atoms.\n- Therefore, the analog of X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄. This means substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify LiAlD₄ with all clues**\n- **Formula:** LiAlD₄\n- **Heavier isotope:** Contains Deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of Hydrogen. ✓\n- **Organic reagent analog:** The analog is LiAlH₄, a very common and important reagent. ✓\n- **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. This reaction is violent, similar to LiAlH₄ with water. ✓\n- **Gas W:** D₂ is produced, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. ✓\n- **Precipitate G:** Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. ✓\n- **G releases B on heating:** Heating aluminum hydroxide dehydrates it (`2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O`). Similarly, heating Al(OD)₃ would release D₂O. So B = D₂O. ✓\n- **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is ~277 K. ✓\n- All clues perfectly match the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n- The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". It specifies that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n- **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n- The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n- **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number Z).\n- **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (by atomic number Z).\n- **Mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, Hydrogen is present as 4 atoms of its isotope Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    - Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n- **Mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** In LiAlD₄, there is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum is 27.\n    - Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n- **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    - Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances.**\n    *   **Substance B and the heavy isotope:** The clue states that B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 4 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance B is heavy water (D₂O), and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W is released, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n        *   Let's analyze deuterium gas, D₂. A single deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   Since the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2), **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** We are told \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". We've identified W as D₂. A violent reaction that produces deuterium gas and involves deuterated compounds strongly suggests the reaction of a powerful deuteride reagent with heavy water.\n        *   Let's assume **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction produces a **precipitate G**.\n        *   When G is heated, it releases **B (D₂O)**. This is consistent with the thermal decomposition of a metal deuteroxide (formed in the reaction) into a metal oxide and heavy water. For example: `M(OD)n -> Metal_Oxide + D₂O`.\n\n    *   **Substance X:** We have several clues for X:\n        *   It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n        *   Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". This points to a common laboratory reagent where a hydrogen atom is replaced by deuterium.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂, and a precipitate G, which we suspect is a metal deuteroxide. A very well-known reaction involves lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Let's check if LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n            *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is famously violent.\n            *   **Gas W:** It produces D₂, which we identified as W.\n            *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OH)₃ is a known precipitate (insoluble gelatinous solid). Therefore, Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. G = Al(OD)₃.\n            *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O, which we identified as B.\n            *   **Organic Chemistry:** LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent, and so is LiAlD₄. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has two reducible groups: a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH). LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ reduces both. The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-), and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH). The final product, a diol, `R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`, contains two oxygen atoms.\n        *   All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".

Its mass is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (D):** There are four atoms of D in LiAlD₄. The cumulative mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total Sum:** The sum of these cumulative masses is 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    The cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**: This strongly suggests a deuterated compound, where deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen, replaces protium (¹H). Such compounds are frequently used in chemistry, especially in organic chemistry, for studying reaction mechanisms.\n\n    *   **\"...and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**: This points towards a common pair of reagents, one being the standard and the other being its deuterated version. The most famous examples are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). These are powerful reducing agents. So, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n\n    *   **\"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**:\n        *   The reaction of metal hydrides with protic solvents like water is famously violent.\n        *   Let's analyze Gas W. We need a molecule with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n            *   Nitrogen gas (N₂): Each ¹⁴N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons.\n            *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   The reaction involves Substance X, which is deuterated. It is highly plausible that the gas W is deuterium gas (D₂). For D₂ to be produced, the deuterium atoms must come from both the reagent (X) and the liquid (Y). If X is LiAlD₄ and it reacts with normal water (H₂O), the gas would be HD, which has 2 protons and 1 neutron (unequal).\n        *   Therefore, the reaction must be between the deuterated reagent (X) and a deuterated liquid (Y). The most common deuterated liquid is heavy water (D₂O).\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → \"products\" + 4D₂ (W)`. This reaction pathway successfully produces D₂ gas, which fits the description of W.\n\n    *   **\"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"**:\n        *   Let's complete our proposed reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`.\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Thus, Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. This fits the clue.\n        *   Now, what happens when G is heated? `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The substance released, B, is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n    *   **\"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**:\n        *   We identified B as heavy water (D₂O). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 273.15 + 3.82 = 276.97 K.\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This serves as a strong confirmation of our hypothesis.\n\n    *   **\"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**:\n        *   X is LiAlD₄, a powerful reducing agent. Keto acids contain both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols. For example, the reduction of pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH) would yield 1,2-propanediol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This resulting diol molecule contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue also aligns perfectly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: Based on the comprehensive analysis of all clues, Substance X is unequivocally identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n\n    *   The question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in its isotopic form, Deuterium D).\n    *   The atomic number identifies the element: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We need to find the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use the mass numbers (integers) for this calculation, as is standard for such problems and implied by the integer answers.\n        *   Mass number of the Deuterium isotope (²H or D) is 2.\n        *   Mass number of the most stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in the formula.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in the formula.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Final Calculation**: The problem asks for the sum of these two cumulative masses.\n        *   Sum = (Cumulative mass of H) + (Cumulative mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nBased on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and the python code execution, the conclusion is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X:** Through a series of logical deductions based on the chemical reactions described, Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The reaction with a keto acid to produce a compound with 2 oxygens points to its analog, LiAlH₄, being a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   The incorporation of a heavy isotope points to Deuterium replacing Hydrogen, making X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The violent reaction with liquid Y (identified as heavy water, D₂O) releases gas W (identified as D₂), which has an equal number of protons (2) and neutrons (2).\n    *   The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃, which upon heating releases B (D₂O), whose melting point (276.97 K) is very close to 277 K.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen.

This is a strong indicator of heavy water, D₂O, whose melting point is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This also identifies the \"heavier isotope\" as Deuterium (D), the isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Substance X and Organic Reaction**: The reaction of a keto acid (containing 3 oxygen atoms) with substance X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction reaction, characteristic of reagents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Given that X contains deuterium, the logical conclusion is that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. LiAlD₄ is a close analog to LiAlH₄, which is widely used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   **The Violent Reaction**: The clues describe X reacting violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (D₂O). This perfectly matches the reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water:\n    *   **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)**\n*   **Verification of Gas W**: The gas released, W, is Deuterium gas (D₂). A single deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue that the gas molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Verification of Precipitate G**: The precipitate G, Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would decompose upon heating to form Al₂O₃ and D₂O (Substance B), fitting the description.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄). The integer mass number for the most common isotopes will be used for calculation.\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element** (by atomic number): Hydrogen (present as Deuterium).\n*   **Heaviest Element** (by atomic number): Aluminum.\n*   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n*   There are four atoms of Deuterium.

The mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.\n    *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Mass from Deuterium) + (Mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: The melting point of B.**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is an extremely strong clue that substance **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: The nature of Substance X.**\n    Substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope\" of one of its constituent elements. This, combined with the identification of B as D₂O, strongly suggests that the isotope in question is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence.**\n    *   Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G (This reaction is violent).\n    *   Precipitate G (when heated) → Substance B (D₂O) + other products.\n    *   Since heating G yields D₂O, G must be a substance that contains deuterium and oxygen, and which can decompose to yield D₂O. A deuterated metal hydroxide, M(OD)n, is a perfect candidate, as metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. So, M(OD)n(s) → MxOy(s) + D₂O(g).\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 3: The nature of Gas W.**\n    The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's test some simple gas molecules that could be formed.\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n    *   HD: 2 protons, 1 neutron. (No)\n    *   **D₂: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)**\n    *   Many other larger gases also fit (N₂, O₂, CH₄, etc.), but D₂ is the most plausible gas to be released when a deuterated reagent reacts, especially if D₂O is involved.\n\n5.  **Synthesize Clues to Identify X, Y, G, and W.**\n    We need a reaction involving a deuterated reagent (X) that produces D₂ gas (W) and a solid deuterated hydroxide precipitate (G) when reacting with a liquid (Y). Let's test common deuterated reagents.\n    *   **Candidate for X:** Let's consider **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, is an extremely common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, fitting Clue 8. LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, fitting Clue 2.\n    *   **Proposing the Reaction:** Let's test the reaction of X = LiAlD₄ with Y = D₂O (heavy water, which is a liquid).\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Let's check if this fits all the clues:**\n        *   **Reaction:** Violent, as expected. (Clue 2)\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches Clue 3.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OH)₃ is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, **Al(OD)₃**, would also be a precipitate. This matches Clue 4.\n        *   **Heating G:** When heated, Al(OD)₃ would decompose: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases **D₂O**, which we identified as substance B. This matches Clue 5.\n    *   All clues so far point to X being LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Final Clue (Clue 7): The Keto Acid Reaction.**\n    \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has two functional groups: a ketone (-CO-) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For example, pyruvic acid: CH₃-CO-COOH.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a very strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids.\n        *   Ketone (-CO-) is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-).\n        *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH).\n    *   So, the reaction with a keto acid like pyruvic acid would be:\n        `CH₃-CO-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄, 2. H₂O workup)--> CH₃-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`\n    *   The final product molecule is a diol (contains two alcohol groups). Let's count the oxygen atoms in this product: there is one oxygen in the first -OH group and one in the second -OH group, for a **total of 2 oxygen atoms**. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n7.  **Final Identification and Calculation.**\n    *   Substance X is definitively **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n    *   The elements present in X are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present in X.\n        *   Atomic number of H: 1\n        *   Atomic number of Li: 3\n        *   Atomic number of Al: 13\n    *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Hydrogen** (present as D) and the **heaviest element is Aluminum**.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit. We will use the mass number (protons + neutrons) for each isotope.\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are 4 deuterium atoms.\n        *   The common stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is 1 aluminum atom.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the chemical properties described:\n1.  **Substance X Identification:**\n    *   Its use as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with a \"close analog,\" and the incorporation of a \"heavier isotope\" points towards deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBD₄). Their analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄.\n    *   The violent reaction with a liquid Y (water, H₂O) and the release of gas W with an equal number of protons and neutrons identifies W as Deuterium gas (D₂), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This implies X is a deuterated compound (contains D) and Y is a source of deuterium, like heavy water (D₂O). The reaction is LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   The precipitate G that forms is Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). When heated, it decomposes (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O), releasing B.\n    *   The melting point of B is ~277 K (3.85 °C). This matches the melting point of heavy water, D₂O (3.82 °C). This confirms B is D₂O.\n    *   The reaction with a keto acid to produce a product with two oxygen atoms is characteristic of LiAlD₄, which reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH).\n    *   Therefore, Substance X is conclusively identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen (Z=1). The heaviest element is Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of *all* instances of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen as Deuterium, D)**: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. The mass number of the deuterium isotope (¹H²) is 2.\n          Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum, Al)**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass** = (Mass from Deuterium) + (Mass from Aluminum) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The standard melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is the isotope Deuterium, ²H) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very strong indication that **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X's Isotope:** Since the reaction pathway produces heavy water, the \"heavier isotope\" incorporated into Substance X must be **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W's molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze potential gases:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is `X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`.\n    *   Substance X contains Deuterium (D). It reacts with a liquid Y to produce D₂. A very common reaction of this type involves a deuterated hydride reacting with a source of deuterium, like heavy water. So, it's highly likely that the liquid **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   When the precipitate G is heated, it releases B (D₂O). This suggests G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, like M(OD)x, which decomposes on heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X is a substance containing Deuterium. Its non-deuterated analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction `X + D₂O` is violent and produces D₂ gas. This is characteristic of strong reducing agents like metal hydrides. The most common are NaBH₄ and LiAlH₄. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride). Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a famously powerful and common reducing agent.\n    *   The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃↓ + 4 D₂↑`.\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate Al(OD)₃ (G). This fits the description. Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B), which also fits.\n\n6.  **Confirm with the Final Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (R-CO-R') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). In total, it has **3 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups. A ketone is reduced to an alcohol, and a carboxylic acid is reduced to an alcohol.\n    *   `R-CO-R'-COOH + LiAlD₄ (and workup) → R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH`\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains two alcohol (-OH) groups. Thus, it contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic #3), Aluminum (Al, atomic #13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic #1).\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D or ²H).\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al).\n    *   We sum the masses of all the D and Al atoms in the molecule, using their mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of D = 2 amu.\n    *   Mass of Al = 27 amu.\n    *   In LiAlD₄, there are 4 atoms of D and 1 atom of Al.\n    *   Total Mass = (4 × Mass of D) + (1 × Mass of Al)\n    *   Total Mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis matches the output from the code execution. The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{35}$.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X**:\n    *   The problem states that \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" and that its reaction with a keto acid results in a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids (R-CO-COOH) have 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups would lead to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   This points to a powerful reducing agent. A common one is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n    *   Since Substance X \"incorporates a heavier isotope\", it is likely the deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Verify with Other Clues**:\n    *   **Reaction with Liquid Y**: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (Y = H₂O).\n    *   **Gas W**: The reaction produces gas. One possible reaction is the thermal decomposition of X due to the heat generated: `LiAlD₄ → LiD + Al + 3/2 D₂`. The gas produced is Deuterium gas (**W = D₂**). A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, matching the description.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The main reaction with water is `LiAlD₄ + 4H₂O → LiOH + Al(OH)₃(s) + 4HD(g)`. The precipitate **G is Aluminium Hydroxide (Al(OH)₃)**.\n    *   **Substance B**: When precipitate G (Al(OH)₃) is heated, it decomposes: `2 Al(OH)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O`. The substance released is water (**B = H₂O**). The melting point of water is 273.15 K, which is \"very close to 277 K\" as stated.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass**:\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D). Its mass number is 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al). Its mass number is 27.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   In one molecule of LiAlD₄:\n        *   Mass from the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 atoms, so 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is 1 atom, so 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative sum is 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nSubstance X, LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride), is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry, and it is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄.\nThe lightest element is Hydrogen (in the form of Deuterium), and the heaviest is Aluminum.\nThere are four atoms of Deuterium (mass number ≈ 2) and one atom of Aluminum (mass number ≈ 27).\nCumulative mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 * 2 = 8\nCumulative mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 * 27 = 27\nTotal cumulative mass: 8 + 27 = 35\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B.**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    However, the problem mentions that substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope\". This suggests we should consider heavy water (D₂O), where D is deuterium, the heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C, which is indeed very close to 277 K.\n    Therefore, Substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Substance X.**\n    Since B (D₂O) is produced from X, X must contain deuterium (D). The problem also states that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent and its deuterated version. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). Let's hypothesize that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the Reaction Chemistry.**\n    Let's check if LiAlD₄ fits the described reaction sequence.\n    *   **Reaction of X with Y:** X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. Hydride reagents react violently with protic solvents like water. Since the products contain deuterium, the logical choice for Y is D₂O. The reaction is:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, which perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a solid precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Heating G:** When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes:\n        `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`\n        This reaction releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. The entire sequence is consistent.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the Organic Chemistry Clue.**\n    A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols. The product of the reaction would be a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. For instance, reducing pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would yield a deuterated 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CD(OD)CD₂OD), which has two oxygen atoms. This clue further confirms X is LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    We have identified substance X as LiAlD₄. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within it.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number, Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic mass, A) is Aluminum (A ≈ 27 u). (Li has A ≈ 7 u).\n    *   The problem instructs that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all...must be summed.\" We will use integer mass numbers as the options are integers.\n    *   **Contribution from the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its only stable isotope, ²⁷Al, is 27.\n    *   **Contribution from the lightest element (H):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** The sum is the mass from Aluminum plus the mass from Deuterium:\n        `Sum = 27 + 8 = 35`\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The first critical clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15.\n    *   T(°C) = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This melting point is characteristic of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which has a melting point of 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Substance G is a precipitate that, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is typical behavior for a metal hydroxide, which dehydrates upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. Since D₂O is released, G must be a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)n. The decomposition reaction is: M(OD)n (s) → Metal Oxide + D₂O (g). The fact that G is a precipitate narrows down the possibilities for the metal M.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Gas W is released during the reaction and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   Let's check common small molecules.\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The molecule D₂ has **2 protons and 2 neutrons** (Yes).\n        *   N₂: Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule N₂ has **14 protons and 14 neutrons** (Yes).\n        *   CO: C has 6p, 6n; O has 8p, 8n. The molecule CO has **14 protons and 14 neutrons** (Yes).\n    *   Given that the system clearly involves deuterium (from B = D₂O), the most plausible candidate for the gas W is **D₂**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reaction and Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G (a metal deuteroxide).\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂(g) + G(s).\n    *   To produce D₂ gas, the deuterium atoms must come from the reactants. This points to a reaction between a deuteride donor (like a D⁻ source) and a deuterium acceptor (like a D⁺ source).\n    *   The classic violent reaction of this type is a metal hydride with water. To produce D₂ gas, a metal deuteride must react with a deuterated protic solvent, like D₂O.\n    *   Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction becomes: Metal Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → D₂ (W) + Metal Deuteroxide (G). This is a consistent and logical reaction pathway.\n\n5.  **Identify Substance X:** We have more clues about X:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope (we've established this is Deuterium, D).\n    *   It's a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" (the non-deuterated version) is also used.\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups must be reduced to alcohols (forming a diol, R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). This requires a very strong reducing agent, as weaker ones (like sodium borohydride) would not reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   A very common, strong reducing agent is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits all the clues perfectly. It's a strong reducing agent, its analog is common, it's a metal deuteride.\n    *   Let's check if it forms a precipitate. The reaction is:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)\n    *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate of Aluminium Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃ (G)**, as aluminium hydroxide is insoluble. Heating G (2Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and 3D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotopic form Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Identified by the lowest atomic number (Z). Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Identified by the highest atomic number. Aluminium (Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   The question states: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes present (D=²H, so mass number = 2; Al=²⁷Al, so mass number = 27).\n    *   **Mass from lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 instances of hydrogen, all as the deuterium isotope (D).\n        Total mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 instance of aluminium.\n        Total mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum the masses calculated for the lightest and heaviest elements.\n        Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope and has a close analog used in organic chemistry.**\n        *   \"Heavier isotope\" often points to deuterium (D or ²H), a stable, heavier isotope of hydrogen (H or ¹H).\n        *   \"Close analog used in organic chemistry\" suggests a common reagent where H can be substituted with D. Powerful reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) are excellent candidates. Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). Let's hypothesize that X is one of these.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.**\n        *   LiAlH₄ is known to react extremely violently with water. So, let's assume the deuterated analog, LiAlD₄ (our candidate for X), also reacts violently.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.**\n        *   Let's analyze the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a liquid Y.\n        *   If Y is normal water (H₂O): `LiAlD₄ + 4 H₂O -> LiOH + Al(OH)₃ + 4 HD`. The gas (W) is HD (hydrogen deuteride). Let's check its proton/neutron count. Protons = 1 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 2. Neutrons = 0 (from H) + 1 (from D) = 1. Protons ≠ Neutrons. This scenario is incorrect.\n        *   Let's consider another possibility for liquid Y. To produce a gas rich in deuterium, the reagent Y should also contain deuterium. The most common deuterated liquid is heavy water, D₂O.\n        *   If Y is heavy water (D₂O): `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`. The gas (W) is D₂ (di-deuterium gas). Let's check its proton/neutron count. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Protons = Neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly.\n        *   This establishes W as D₂ and Y as D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 4: A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   From our proposed reaction, the products in the solution are LiOD and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), will also be a precipitate. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n        *   When metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides) are heated, they decompose, releasing water (or heavy water). The reaction is: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`.\n        *   So, the released substance B is D₂O (heavy water).\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\". This strongly confirms that B is D₂O, G is Al(OD)₃, and our overall reaction scheme is correct.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). A simple example is pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Our candidate for X is LiAlD₄, a powerful reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n        *   Reacting pyruvic acid with LiAlD₄ would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol, resulting in 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OD)CH₂OD after deuterated workup, or CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH after H₂O workup).\n        *   The resulting molecule, a diol, contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This matches the clue exactly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Identify the elements in X:** The substance is LiAlD₄. The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:** We compare the elements by their atomic number (Z):\n        *   Hydrogen (H): Z = 1\n        *   Lithium (Li): Z = 3\n        *   Aluminum (Al): Z = 13\n        *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n        *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n    *   **Calculate the cumulative mass for the lightest element:**\n        *   The lightest element is Hydrogen, which is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (D or ²H).\n        *   The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 4 atoms × 2 (mass per atom) = 8.\n    *   **Calculate the cumulative mass for the heaviest element:**\n        *   The heaviest element is Aluminum, which is present as 1 atom.\n        *   The stable and most common isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al.\n        *   The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 1 atom × 27 (mass per atom) = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final sum:**\n        *   The question asks for the sum of these two cumulative masses.\n        *   Total = (Cumulative mass of H) + (Cumulative mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 5: The nature of substance B.**\n    The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    This is a very strong indication that substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clues 1, 3, and 4: The reaction.**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   Substance X reacts with liquid Y to form a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (D₂O). This means G is likely a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide that decomposes upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide `M(OD)n` would decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide `MxOy` and D₂O (B).\n    *   The reaction also releases a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential simple gases involving deuterium:\n        *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D), 1 neutron (0 from H, 1 from D). Protons ≠ Neutrons.\n        *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas)**: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). **Protons = Neutrons**. This is a perfect match. So, **W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Clues to Identify X and the Reaction.**\n    The reaction is: X + Y → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n    And G(s) --(heat)--> Substance + D₂O(g).\n    For D₂ gas to be a product, X must be a deuteride, and it must react with a source of deuterium, which would be liquid Y. The most logical candidate for **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n    The precipitate G must be a metal deuteroxide. A common metal hydroxide that precipitates is Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. Its deuterated analog would be **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    The heating of aluminum hydroxide follows the reaction: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O.\n    Thus, heating our G would be: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O (Substance B), confirming our hypothesis.\n    So, the reaction involves Aluminum (Al) and Deuterium (D). This strongly suggests that Substance X is a deuteride of aluminum.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clues 8 and 9: The nature of Substance X.**\n    *   Clue 9: X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n    *   Clue 8: The reaction of X with a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) gives a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains two functional groups: a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH), totaling 3 oxygen atoms (in the simplest cases). Reducing both groups leads to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. A reagent powerful enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids is **Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n    *   The \"very close analog\" containing deuterium would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Identity of X as LiAlD₄.**\n    Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n    *   **Substance X is LiAlD₄.** Contains the heavy isotope D. (✓)\n    *   **Its close analog is LiAlH₄,** a very common organic reagent. (✓)\n    *   It reduces a keto acid to a diol, a product with **2 oxygen atoms**. (✓)\n    *   The reaction with Y = D₂O is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This reaction is famously **violent**. (✓)\n    *   It releases **gas W = D₂**, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. (✓)\n    *   It forms a **precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**. (✓)\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases **B = D₂O**, whose melting point is ~277 K. (✓)\n    All conditions are met. Therefore, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation.**\n    The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄). The integer format of the answer choices suggests we should use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D or ²H).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al, present as the isotope ²⁷Al).\n    *   The problem specifies summing the masses of all instances of these elements in the molecule.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms = 1 × (Mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms = 4 × (Mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the chemical clues:\n1.  **Substance B**: The melting point of ~277 K (3.85 °C) is characteristic of heavy water, **D₂O**.\n2.  **Substance X and the Heavier Isotope**: Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope involved is **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n3.  **Substance G**: Precipitate G releases D₂O when heated, implying it's a metal deuteroxide.\n4.  **Gas W**: A gas where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. **Deuterium gas (D₂) ** is a prime candidate (2 protons, 2 neutrons).\n5.  **Reaction and Identity of X**: The violent reaction, the use in organic chemistry as a reducing agent (reducing a keto acid to a diol), and the production of D₂ gas and a deuteroxide precipitate all point to **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The reaction with D₂O would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Here, Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   Their mass numbers are approximately: D = 2, Li = 7, Al = 27.\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (represented by its isotope D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n    *   The instruction is to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements found in the molecule.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element's atoms = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element's atom = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches the output from the code.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
