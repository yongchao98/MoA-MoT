Let's summarize the steps and verify the result.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Bond Count:**\n    *   The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   The molecular formula is C12H22.\n    *   Number of C-H bonds = 22.\n    *   Number of C=C bonds = 2.\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 9.\n\n2.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants (Elements):**\n    *   The formation reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22`.\n    *   Energy to atomize reactants = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 * BE(H-H))\n    *   Energy = (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n3.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Product (Compound):**\n    *   This is the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Energy = (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C)) + (22 * BE(C-H))\n    *   Energy = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ**.\n\n4.  **Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):**\n    *   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants) - (Enthalpy of Atomization of Product)\n    *   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n5.  **Conversion to kJ/g:**\n    *   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔH_f (per gram) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThe Python code output confirms these calculations:\n*   Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\n*   Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.424... (The slight difference is due to using more precise atomic masses in the code).\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe chemical formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`=`), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is one less than the number of carbon atoms. Total C atoms = 12, so there are 12 - 1 = 11 bonds in the carbon skeleton. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following equation, which relates it to atomization energies and bond energies:\n\nΔHf° = [Σ(Enthalpy of atomization of reactants)] - [Σ(Bond energies of the product)]\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of reactants.**\nThis is the energy needed to convert the elements from their standard state to gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 (i.e., break 11 moles of H-H bonds): 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule (C12H22).**\nThis is the energy released when forming all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous product from its gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ = 8800 kJ\n*   Total bond energy = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = **11200 kJ**\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol.**\n*   ΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization) - (Total bond energy)\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ - 11200 kJ = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Check the Options and Convert Units**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value per mole (1900 kJ/mol) does not match option C or D. Option A has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). We need to convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 * Atomic Mass of C) + (22 * Atomic Mass of H)\n    Using approximate integer masses: 12 * 12 g/mol + 22 * 1 g/mol = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The final answer should be checked against the given options, which have units of kJ/mol or kJ/g.\n\n2.  **Define Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The calculation using bond energies and enthalpies of atomization follows this formula:\n    ΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of reactant elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the product molecule)]\n\n3.  **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Write the Formation Reaction.**\n    *   Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n    *   Count Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from C=) + 1 (from =CH-) + 1 (from -CH2-) + 2 (from -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 3 (from =C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Count Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from =CH-) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 4 (from -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Molecular Formula: **C12H22**\n    *   The standard state of Carbon is solid (graphite), C(s).\n    *   The standard state of Hydrogen is gas, H2(g).\n    *   Formation Reaction: **12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22**\n\n4.  **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants.**\n    This is the energy required to convert the reactants (12 C(s) and 11 H2(g)) into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) and 22 H(g)).\n    *   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atom(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   Energy to break bonds in 11 moles of H2: 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n5.  **Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product (C12H22).**\n    This is the sum of all bond energies in one mole of the molecule. We need to count the number of each type of bond.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of C-C bonds (single and multiple) is (Number of C atoms) - 1.\n        *   Total C-C links = 12 - 1 = 11.\n        *   Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n    *   Now, sum the bond energies:\n        *   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n        *   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n        *   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Total Bond Energy (Enthalpy of Atomization of Product) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *(Self-check: Option C is 11200 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.)*\n\n6.  **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol.**\n    *   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of product)\n    *   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n    *(Self-check: Option B is 1900 kJ/g, not kJ/mol. This suggests we need to perform a unit conversion.)*\n\n7.  **Step 5: Convert the Answer to kJ/g.**\n    *   First, calculate the molar mass of C12H22. (Using integer masses as is common in such problems: C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol).\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n    *   Now, convert ΔH_f from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol)\n\n8.  **Step 6: Execute the final calculation.**\n    *   This calculation was performed by the provided Python code.\n    *   `1900 / 166 = 11.44578...` kJ/g.\n\n9.  **Step 7: Compare with Options.**\n    *   The calculated value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\nFinal confirmation of steps and calculation shows the logic is sound and the result matches one of the options perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the following formula which relates the enthalpy of formation to the enthalpy of atomization and bond energies:\n\n**Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°) = [Σ Enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Σ Bond energies of the compound]**\n\nHere, the term \"[Σ Bond energies of the compound]\" is equivalent to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the types of bonds.**\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from C=) + 1 (from =CH-) + 1 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH-) + 1 (from CH3 branch) + 1 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 1 (from =C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = **12 C atoms**.\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 2*3 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from =CH-) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH-) + 3 (from CH3 branch) + 2 (from -CH2-) + 1 (from -CH=) + 2*3 (from (CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNow, let's count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** Equal to the number of H atoms = **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the main chain = **2**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds between carbons is (number of C atoms - 1) + number of rings = 11.

So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We need to count all the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   In the first `(CH3)2C` group: 2 bonds (C-CH3)\n    *   Between the main chain carbons: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`.

So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds involving carbon is determined by the valency of carbon (4). Total bonds = (12 carbons * 4 valency) / 2 = 24 bonds. We already counted 22 C-H bonds and 2 C=C bonds. The number of single C-C bonds is the total number of carbon-carbon bonds minus the number of C=C bonds.

There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   2 bonds in (CH₃)₂C=\n    *   1 bond between =CH- and -CH₂-\n    *   1 bond between -CH₂- and -CH(CH₃)-\n    *   1 bond in -CH(CH₃)- (to the methyl group)\n    *   1 bond between -CH(CH₃)- and -CH₂-\n    *   1 bond between -CH₂- and -CH=\n    *   2 bonds in =C(CH₃)₂\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (12 moles of C(graphite) and 11 moles of H₂(gas)) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of C(gas) and 22 moles of H(gas)).\n\n*   Formation of 12 moles of C(g): 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Formation of 22 moles of H(g) from 11 moles of H₂(g): 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total energy input (ΔH₁)** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy released when all the gaseous atoms (12 C and 22 H) combine to form one mole of the gaseous compound. This is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy (ΔH₂)** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Molar Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the net energy change of the process.\nΔH_f° = (Energy input to atomize elements) - (Energy released from forming bonds)\nΔH_f° = ΔH₁ - ΔH₂\nΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Convert to kJ/g to Match Options**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy is 1900 kJ/mol. Options C and D are given in kJ/g. We need to convert our result.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂:**\n    *   M = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   M ≈ (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.01 g/mol) ≈ 144.12 + 22.22 = 166.34 g/mol\n*   **Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g:**\n    *   ΔH_f° (kJ/g) = ΔH_f° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166.34 g/mol ≈ **11.42 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C. The slight difference is due to rounding or the exact atomic masses used.\n\nThe code output also confirms the calculation:\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.42\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThe problem asks for the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) can be calculated using the following relationship based on Hess's law:\n\n**ΔHf = [Enthalpy of atomization of elements in their standard state] - [Total bond energy of the compound]**\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.**\n\nThe structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds. (Count = 2)\n*   **C-C bonds:** There are 9 single bonds between carbon atoms.\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 single bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements.**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   **Atomization of Carbon:** 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **Atomization of Hydrogen:** 11 mol × (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total bond energy of the compound.**\n\nThis is the energy released when one mole of the gaseous compound is formed from its gaseous atoms. We sum the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Compound:** 600 kJ + 1800 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\n\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of compound)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 5: Check the units of the options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's look at the options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value in kJ/mol (1900) does not match option A. Option C is the total bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation. Option D has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option B is in kJ/g, so let's convert our result to these units.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:**\n    (1900 kJ / 1 mol) × (1 mol / 166 g) = 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value rounds to 11.44 kJ/g, which matches option B. The Python code output also confirms this result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we follow these steps:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Counts**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the molecule to determine its molecular formula and the number of each type of chemical bond.\nThe structural formula is:\n```\n      CH3                             CH3\n      |                               |\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n      |\n      CH3\n```\n*   **Counting Carbon Atoms (C):**\n    *   There are 7 carbon atoms in the main chain.\n    *   There are 5 methyl (CH3) groups attached, which contain 5 carbon atoms.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   **Counting Hydrogen Atoms (H):**\n    *   From the two (CH3)2C= groups: 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 H atoms.\n    *   From the =CH- group: 1 H atom.\n    *   From the -CH2- groups: 2 * 2 = 4 H atoms.\n    *   From the -CH(CH3)- group: 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H atoms.\n    *   From the =CH- group: 1 H atom.\n    *   Let's recount more systematically from the full structure: (CH3)2[C] + [C]H + CH2 + CH(CH3) + CH2 + CH + [C](CH3)2. This doesn't seem right.\n    *   Let's use the given condensed formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Number of carbons: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (from C) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n    *   Number of hydrogens: (2 * 3) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + (2 * 3) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Counting Bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure has two double bonds (`C=C`). So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds involving carbon can be calculated. The sum of valencies for 12 carbons is 12 * 4 = 48. This must equal 2*(No. C-C bonds) + 2*(No. C=C bonds) + (No. C-H bonds).\n        Let x = number of C-C bonds.\n        48 = 2*x + 2*2 + 22\n        48 = 2x + 4 + 22\n        48 = 2x + 26\n        2x = 22\n        x = 11. Let's re-verify by counting.\n        Bonds in chain: C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. (4 bonds)\n        Bonds to methyls: 2 on C1, 1 on C4, 2 on C7. (5 bonds)\n        Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n        Let's re-check the valency calculation:\n        48 = 2*(No. of C-bonds) = 2*(No. of C-C) + 2*(No. of C=C) + (No. of C-H)\n        No, that's not right. Each bond connects two atoms. Total bonds = (Sum of Valencies)/2.\n        For C12H22, total bonds = (12*4 + 22*1)/2 = (48+22)/2 = 35 bonds.\n        Total bonds = (No. C-C) + (No. C=C) + (No. C-H)\n        35 = (No. C-C) + 2 + 22\n        No. C-C = 35 - 24 = 11.

Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nWe need to count all the covalent bonds within one molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The carbon skeleton consists of 12 carbon atoms. In a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds between the N atoms in the skeleton is N-1. Here, N=12, so there are 12-1 = 11 total bonds (both single and double) connecting the carbon atoms.

Total C = 1 + 1 = 2; Total H = 1 + 3 = 4.\n*   `-CH2-`: This part has 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   `-CH=`: This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: This part has 1 central carbon and 2 methyl groups. Total C = 1 + 2 = 3; Total H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\n\nFrom the structure `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is simply the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `=`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure:\n    *   2 bonds in `(CH3)2C=` (from the central C to the two CH3 groups)\n    *   1 bond between `CH` and `CH2`\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and `CH(CH3)`\n    *   1 bond within `CH(CH3)` (from the chain C to the CH3 group)\n    *   1 bond between `CH(CH3)` and the next `CH2`\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and `CH`\n    *   2 bonds in `=C(CH3)2` (from the central C to the two CH3 groups)\n    Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n*   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n*   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n\n**3.

Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the elements (ΔH_atomization_reactants).**\n\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nGiven data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization_reactants = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nΔH_atomization_reactants = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization_reactants = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\n**5. Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound.**\n\nΔH_f = ΔH_atomization_reactants - ΔH_atomization_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**6. Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nThe options are:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol, while option D is 1900 kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\nWe need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 × (molar mass of C) + 22 × (molar mass of H)\nM ≈ 12 × 12.0 g/mol + 22 × 1.0 g/mol = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert ΔH_f from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we will follow these steps based on Hess's Law and bond energy data. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) can be calculated using the formula:\nΔHf° = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements in their standard states] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (=C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 2*3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2*3 = 22 hydrogens.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Bonds**\nWe need to determine the number of each type of bond in one molecule of the compound.\n*   **C-H bonds:** Count all hydrogen atoms, as each is bonded to a carbon. There are 22 H atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds: C=CH and CH=C. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can find this by subtracting the carbons in C=C bonds from the total C-C links. Total carbon atoms = 12.\n    The main carbon chain can be visualized as C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C. If all were single bonds, there would be 11 C-C links.\n    The structure has 2 C=C bonds and 9 C-C bonds. Let's verify by drawing and counting:\n    Structure: `(CH3)2=C(1)-CH(2)-CH2(3)-CH(CH3)(4)-CH2(5)-CH(6)=C(CH3)2(7)`\n    - C-C single bonds in the backbone: C1-C2, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. (5 bonds)\n    - C-C single bonds in the side groups:\n        - 2 bonds for (CH3)2 on C1\n        - 1 bond for (CH3) on C4\n        - 2 bonds for (CH3)2 on C7\n    - Total C-C bonds = 4 (in chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 bonds.\nSo, we have:\n*   22 C-H bonds\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atomization(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(graphite), H2(g)) to gaseous atoms (C(g), H(g)).\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n*   For Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy = 12 × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 × 1000 = 12000 kJ\n*   For Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    Energy = 11 × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 = 1100 kJ\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nΔHf° = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of compound]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 6: Check the Options**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches, but the unit is per gram)\n\nSince our calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) is not an option, but an option with the same number (1900) but different units (kJ/g) exists, let's convert our answer to kJ/g to see if it matches any other option.\n\n**Step 7: Convert Enthalpy of Formation to kJ/g**\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.011) + (22 × 1.008) g/mol ≈ 166.3 g/mol. Using integer masses for simplicity as is common in such problems, M = 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = ΔHf° (in kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (in g/mol)\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.445 kJ/g\n\nThis value (11.445 kJ/g) matches option B (11.44 kJ/g) very well. It is common in multiple-choice questions for the answer to be presented in units that require conversion. Option D has the correct numerical value but incorrect units that would represent a physically enormous and incorrect amount of energy if interpreted as written. Therefore, option B is the most plausible correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nAn enthalpy of formation calculation involves a Hess's Law cycle using atomization energies. The overall process can be thought of in two main steps:\n1.  Breaking the reactants (elements in their standard state) into individual gaseous atoms.\n2.  Forming the product molecule from these gaseous atoms.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the net energy change of this process.\nΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of product)\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecule to find its formula and bond structure.**\nThe molecule is (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH₃)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH₃)₂) = 12 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 6 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH₃)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH₃)₂) = 22 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The formula C₁₂H₂₂ tells us there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds indicated: (CH₃)₂**C=C**H- and -**C=C**(CH₃)₂. This gives **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: For any acyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds is (Number of C atoms) - 1. Here, it is 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the product (the molecule C₁₂H₂₂).**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule. It's the sum of all bond energies.\nΔHₐ(product) = (No. C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nΔHₐ(product) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHₐ(product) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the reactants.**\nThe formation reaction is: 12C(graphite) + 11H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\nWe need to turn 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas into gaseous atoms.\nΔHₐ(reactants) = (12 × ΔHₐ(C)) + (11 × BE_H-H)\nΔHₐ(reactants) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHₐ(reactants) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\nΔHf = ΔHₐ(reactants) - ΔHₐ(product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Check the units of the options.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to see if it matches any option.\n*   Calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n*   Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nAn error occurred during the execution of the code. I will do my best to resolve it and find a solution.\nHere's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the organic molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`. We are given the enthalpy of atomization for carbon and bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the heat change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. We can calculate this using Hess's Law and bond energies. The general formula is:\n\n**ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the molecule)**\n\n### **2. Detailed Steps**\n\n**Step 2a: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   Start from the left:\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: This group has 1 C directly in the chain, and 2 `CH3` groups attached. So, `1 + 2 = 3` carbons and `2 * 3 = 6` hydrogens.\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen in the chain, plus a `CH3` group. So, `1 + 1 = 2` carbons and `1 + 3 = 4` hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 carbon in the chain and 2 `CH3` groups. So, `1 + 2 = 3` carbons and `2 * 3 = 6` hydrogens.\n*   Summing them up:\n    *   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C**\n    *   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**Step 2b: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n`12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`\n\nWe need to calculate the enthalpy change to convert the reactants (elements) into gaseous atoms:\n`12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`\n\n*   **For Carbon**: We need 12 moles of gaseous Carbon atoms from solid Carbon.\n    *   Enthalpy = 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen**: We need 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen atoms from H2 gas. Since we start with H2 molecules, we need to break 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   Enthalpy = 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**:\n    *   ΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 2c: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the C12H22 molecule. This requires counting all the C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure `(CH3)2C=CH-...-CH=C(CH3)2` clearly shows **2 C=C double bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The total number of bonds between the 12 carbon atoms is `(12 - 1) = 11` in a non-cyclic, saturated skeleton. Here we have two double bonds. The total number of linkages (single or double) between carbon atoms is 11. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Let's verify by counting from the structure:\n    *   (CH**3**)**C**-**C**=(CH**3**) : 2 C-C\n    *   =C-**C**H-**C**H2- : 1 C-C\n    *   -CH2-**C**H(CH**3**)- : 2 C-C\n    *   -CH(CH3)-**C**H2- : 1 C-C\n    *   -CH2-**C**H=**C**(CH3)2: 1 C-C\n    *   =**C**(**C**H3)(**C**H3): 2 C-C\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n    *   Total bonds between carbons = 9 (single) + 2 (double) = 11. This is consistent.\n\n*   **Total Bond Energy Calculation**:\n    *   BE_molecule = (22 * BE(C-H)) + (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C))\n    *   BE_molecule = (22 * 400) + (9 * 200) + (2 * 300)\n    *   BE_molecule = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 2d: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1:\n*   ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(elements) - BE_molecule\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 2e: Check the Options and Convert Units**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value matches the number in option D, but the units are kJ/g. This suggests either a typo in the option's unit or that the intended answer is in kJ/g, requiring a unit conversion. Let's perform the conversion to see if it matches option C.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    *   M = 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\n    *   Using standard atomic weights: M ≈ 12 * 12.01 g/mol + 22 * 1.01 g/mol ≈ 144.12 + 22.22 = 166.34 g/mol.\n    *   (Often in such problems, using integer masses is sufficient: 12 * 12 + 22 * 1 = 166 g/mol)\n\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g**:\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166.34 ≈ **11.42 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value is very close to option C. The python script execution, which used more precise molar masses, confirms this: `Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.4245...`.\n\nTherefore, the calculated enthalpy of formation is ~11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe user wants me to solve a chemistry problem involving enthalpy calculations.\n\n**1.

So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    - **C=C bonds:** The structure is `C=C-C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    - **C-C bonds (single bonds):**\n        - Bonds within the main chain: There are 8 carbons in the chain, so 7 connections. Two are double bonds, so 7 - 2 = 5 single bonds in the chain backbone. Let's re-verify this: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. No, it's `C=C` then a `C-C`, then `C-C`, then `C-C`, then `C=C`. This looks like `C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`. The single bonds are C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. That's 4 C-C bonds.\n        - Bonds to methyl groups:\n            - `(CH3)2C=` has two C-C bonds.\n            - `-CH(CH3)-` has one C-C bond.\n            - `=C(CH3)2` has two C-C bonds.\n        - Total C-C bonds = 4 (chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 (branches) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Summary of bonds:**\n- 22 C-H bonds\n- 9 C-C bonds\n- 2 C=C bonds\n\n**Step B: Calculate the total energy required to atomize the elements (Reactants).**\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nThe energy to turn reactants into gaseous atoms is:\n- For 12 moles of C(s) → 12 C(g): 12 * ΔHa(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n- For 11 moles of H2(g) → 22 H(g): This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds. 11 * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n- Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step C: Calculate the total bond energy of the product (the compound).**\nThis is the energy released when gaseous atoms form one mole of the compound.

Option A has the right number but wrong units. Option B and C are incorrect. Option D has different units (kJ/g). Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n- Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.008) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n- ΔHf° in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n- This value matches option D.\n\nLet's use the provided python code's output to confirm.\n`Code output: Enthalpy of Formation = 1900.0 kJ/mol`\n`Code output: Enthalpy of Formation = 11.44578313253012 kJ/g`\n\nThe python script calculation (which uses integer atomic masses 12 and 1) gives 11.4457... kJ/g, which rounds to 11.44 kJ/g. This confirms my manual calculation and points directly to option D.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n1.  The enthalpy of formation is calculated as ΔHf° = [Atomization energy of elements] - [Bond energy of compound].\n2.  Atomization energy of elements (12 C + 11 H2) = (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100) = 13100 kJ/mol.\n3.  Bond energy of compound C12H22 (with 9 C-C, 2 C=C, 22 C-H bonds) = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400) = 11200 kJ/mol.\n4.  ΔHf° = 13100 - 11200 = 1900 kJ/mol.\n5.  To convert to kJ/g, we divide by the molar mass (approx. 166 g/mol): 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.44 kJ/g.\n6.

Since the given data are round numbers, we use C=12 and H=1.\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Count the Number and Type of Bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds `(C=C)`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of C-C bonds (single and multiple) is `(number of C atoms) - 1`. Here, it is 12 - 1 = 11. Since there are 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = 9.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule (Enthalpy of Atomization):**\n    *   This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule.\n    *   Energy = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\n    *   Energy = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n    *   Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):**\n    *   The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g).\n    *   ΔHf = [Energy to atomize reactants] - [Energy to atomize product]\n    *   Energy to atomize reactants = (12 × Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (11 × Bond energy of H-H)\n    *   Energy to atomize reactants = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.\n    *   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g to Match Options:**\n    *   The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g.

There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** We need to count all single bonds between carbon atoms.\n        *   In the main chain skeleton: C=**C-C**-**C-C**-**C-C**=C. There are 4 C-C single bonds in the main chain.\n        *   Connecting methyl groups: There are five methyl groups (CH3), each attached by a C-C single bond. So, there are 5 more C-C single bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom,compound)**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound.

The molecular formula for the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2` is C12H22. \nTo determine the enthalpy of formation, we first need to ascertain the number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, and C-H bonds present in one molecule of the given compound. Let's break down the structure to count the bonds accurately:\n\nThe molecule's structure is:\n`CH3` `CH3` `CH3`\n`|` `|` `|`\n`H3C — C = CH — CH2 — CH — CH2 — CH = C — CH3`\n`|` `|`\n`CH3` `CH3`\n\n*   C-H bonds: There are eight `CH3` groups (24 H) and two `CH` groups (2 H) and two CH2 groups (4H). Total Hydrogens: 6 + 1 + 2 + (1+3) + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   C=C bonds: The structure clearly shows **2 C=C double bonds**.\n*   C-C single bonds: We count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms:\n    *   Two bonds connect the first carbon to its two `CH3` groups.\n    *   One bond connects `=CH-` to `-CH2-`.\n    *   One bond connects `-CH2-` to `-CH(CH3)-`.\n    *   One bond connects the `-CH(CH3)-` carbon to its own `CH3` group.\n    *   One bond connects `-CH(CH3)-` to the next `-CH2-`.\n    *   One bond connects `-CH2-` to the `-CH=`.\n    *   Two bonds connect the final `=C<` carbon to its two `CH3` groups.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nWith this information, we proceed with the calculation:\n### 1. Calculation of the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule\nThe total bond energy, which represents the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, is the sum of the energies of all its bonds.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   **Total bond energy of the molecule** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements\nThis is the energy needed to create 12 moles of gaseous carbon atoms and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen atoms from their standard states.\n\n*   Enthalpy to form 12 moles of C(g): 12 * Enthalpy of atomization of C = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Enthalpy to form 22 moles of H(g): For H, we are given the H-H bond energy. The energy to create one mole of H atoms is half the H-H bond energy. Therefore, the enthalpy of atomization for H is (1/2) * 100 kJ/mol = 50 kJ/mol. So for 22 moles, it's 22 * 50 kJ = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of the elements** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)\nThe enthalpy of formation is given by:\n\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the molecule)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### 4. Conversion to kJ/g\nThe final step is to convert this value from kJ/mol to kJ/g. First, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n\n*   Molar mass of C = 12.01 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   **Molar mass of C12H22** = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.008) = 144.12 + 22.176 = **166.296 g/mol**. Approximating with integer masses gives 166 g/mol, which is usually sufficient for these problems.\nNow we convert to kJ/g:\n\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166.296 g/mol = **11.425 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value rounds to 11.44 kJ/g, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass\nFirst, let's identify the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   Start with the carbon backbone and attached groups:\n    *   (CH₃)₂C= : This part has 1 central carbon and 2 methyl (CH₃) groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n    *   =CH- : 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   -CH₂- : 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   -CH(CH₃)- : This part has 1 carbon in the main chain and 1 attached methyl group. Total: 2 C, (1+3) = 4 H.\n    *   -CH₂- : 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   -CH= : 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   =C(CH₃)₂ : 1 central carbon and 2 methyl groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   Summing these up:\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Molar Mass:** Using integer atomic weights (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) which is standard for this type of problem with simplified data:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Covalent Bonds\nNow, we count each type of bond in the molecule's structure.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms directly gives the number of C-H bonds, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: `C=C` and `CH=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) structure with `n` carbon atoms, there are a total of `n-1` carbon-carbon linkages (both single and double). Here, n=12, so there are 12-1=11 total C-C links. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the rest must be single bonds.\n    Number of C-C bonds = Total links - Number of C=C bonds = 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form individual gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n*   **ΔH_atomization(compound)** = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\n*   Using the given values:\n    *   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   **ΔH_atomization(compound)** = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\n    = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n    = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements\nThis is the energy required to convert the constituent elements in their standard states (solid carbon, gaseous H₂) into individual gaseous atoms needed to form the compound (12 moles of C atoms, 22 moles of H atoms).\n*   **Formation equation:** 12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n*   **Energy to atomize elements (ΔH_atomization(elements))** = (12 × ΔH_atomization(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n*   Using the given values:\n    *   ΔH_atomization(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n*   **ΔH_atomization(elements)** = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\n    = 12000 + 1100\n    = **13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\nThe enthalpy of formation of the compound can be found by applying Hess's Law, which results in the following formula:\n*   **ΔH_f = ΔH_atomization(elements) - ΔH_atomization(compound)**\n*   **ΔH_f** = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n    = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 6: Convert to kJ/g and Compare with Options\nThe question asks for the answer in specific units, and the options include both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/g)** = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/g)** = 1900 / 166\n\nThe code execution provides the result of this division: 11.44578313253012.\nThis value is approximately **11.45 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n*   A) **11.44 kJ/g** (Matches our calculation)\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\n*   C) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect unit; our value is 1900 kJ/mol)\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation)\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, we will use the principles of thermochemistry involving bond energies and enthalpies of atomization.\n\nThe overall process can be thought of as a Hess's law cycle:\n1.  Atomize the elements in their standard states to form gaseous atoms.\n2.  Combine the gaseous atoms to form one mole of the gaseous compound. The enthalpy change for this step is the negative of the total bond energy of the molecule.\n3.  The sum of the enthalpy changes for these two steps is the enthalpy of formation of the compound.\n\nThe formula is:\nΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\n\nThe structure is:\n` (CH3)2  C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C  (CH3)2`\n`            |`\n`           CH3`\n\n*   **Count Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 3 C\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 2 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH=C(CH3)2`: 4 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 12 C\n\n*   **Count Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   Total number of H atoms is 22.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Count the types of bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure. Count = **2**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:**\n        *   Between carbon atoms in the main chain: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are 4 C-C single bonds here.\n        *   From the methyl (CH3) groups to the main chain: The `(CH3)2C=` group has 2, the `-CH(CH3)-` group has 1, and the `C(CH3)2` group has 2. Total = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 C-C single bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound. It's the sum of all the bond energies.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Total bond energy (ΔH_atom, compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as graphite solid, H as H2 gas) to gaseous atoms. We need 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\n*   Formation of 12 moles of C(g) from C(s): `12 C(s) -> 12 C(g)`\n    *   Energy required = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Formation of 22 moles of H(g) from H2(g): `11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)`\n    *   This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   Energy required = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of elements (ΔH_atom, elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom, elements - ΔH_atom, compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options and Convert Units if Necessary**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOption B has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\nOption D has units of kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to these units.\n\n*   Molar Mass (M) of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value rounds to **11.44 kJ/g** (or 11.45 kJ/g depending on rounding rules), which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe user wants me to solve a thermochemistry problem. I will follow the standard procedure for calculating the enthalpy of formation from bond energies and enthalpies of atomization.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecule and Determine the Molecular Formula**\nThe given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nI need to count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to determine the molecular formula, C_xH_y.\n*   (CH3)2C=: 1 C + 2*(1 C) = 3 C; 2*3 = 6 H\n*   =CH-: 1 C, 1 H\n*   -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H\n*   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C + 1 C = 2 C; 1 H + 3 H = 4 H\n*   -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H\n*   -CH=: 1 C, 1 H (There seems to be a typo in the question's formula here, it should be -CH= to have the correct valence for Carbon, but let's re-read the original structure. Oh wait, it is `-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, that's fine.)\n*   =C(CH3)2: 1 C + 2*(1 C) = 3 C; 2*3 = 6 H\n\nLet's recount to be sure:\n- Part 1: (CH3)2C=  -> C3H6\n- Part 2: =CH-       -> C1H1\n- Part 3: -CH2-       -> C1H2\n- Part 4: -CH(CH3)-  -> C2H4\n- Part 5: -CH2-       -> C1H2\n- Part 6: -CH=       -> C1H1\n- Part 7: =C(CH3)2  -> C3H6\n\nWait, there are two double bonds `C=C`. The structure is: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\nThe chain is `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. This is a 7 carbon chain with branches.\nLet's just sum the atoms.\n- Total Carbon atoms = (2 * 1) + 1 + 1 + 1 + (1 + 1) + 1 + 1 + (1 * 2) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 12 Carbons. So, x=12.\n- Total Hydrogen atoms = (2 * 3) + 1 + 2 + (1 + 3) + 2 + 1 + (2 * 3) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogens. So, y=22.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\nI will now count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The count is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: From the formula `(CH3)2C=CH-...` and `-CH=C(CH3)2`, it's clear there are **2** C=C double bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The total number of bonds in an acyclic molecule is (Number of atoms - 1).\n    Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\n    Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33.\n    Number of C-C single bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C-H bonds) - (Number of C=C bonds)\n    Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9**.\n    Let's verify by drawing and counting:\n    (CH3)-C(CH3)= -> 2 C-C bonds\n    C=C-C -> 1 C-C bond\n    C-C-C -> 1 C-C bond\n    C-C(CH3)-C -> 2 C-C bonds\n    C-C-C -> 1 C-C bond\n    C-C=C -> 1 C-C bond\n    =C(CH3)-(CH3) -> 2 C-C bonds\n    Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + (1 C-C to chain, 1 C-C to CH3) + 1 + 1 + 2 = wait, this is getting confusing. The formula method is more reliable. Let me redraw carefully.\n    \n      CH3           CH3           CH3\n       |             |             |\n      C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C\n       |                           |\n      CH3                         CH3\n      \n    - C-C bonds in (CH3)2C group: 2\n    - C-C bond between C=C and CH2: 1\n    - C-C bond between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1\n    - C-C bond within CH(CH3): 1\n    - C-C bond between CH(CH3) and CH2: 1\n    - C-C bond between CH2 and CH=C: 1\n    - C-C bond between CH and C=C: 1\n    - C-C bonds in =C(CH3)2 group: 2\n    Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 11. My previous calculation was wrong. Let me re-check.\n\nAh, my drawing to formula link was wrong. Let's trace the chain from the given formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n- (CH3)2C-: 2 C-C bonds here.\n- -C=CH-: The double bond.\n- =CH-CH2-: 1 C-C bond.\n- -CH2-CH(CH3)-: 1 C-C bond linking to the CH. Inside the group, there's another C-C to the CH3. That's 2 C-C bonds here.\n- -CH(CH3)-CH2-: 1 C-C bond.\n- -CH2-CH=: 1 C-C bond.\n- =C(CH3)2: 2 C-C bonds here.\nSumming them up: 2 + 1 + 1 (chain) + 1 (branch) + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds. Okay, the first calculation was correct. The structural interpretation is key. `CH(CH3)` is a `CH` in the main chain bonded to a `CH3` group.\n\nSo, counts are confirmed:\n*   9 x C-C bonds\n*   2 x C=C bonds\n*   22 x C-H bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔHa,compound)**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔHa,compound = (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C)) + (22 * BE(C-H))\nGiven bond energies (BE):\nBE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\nBE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\nBE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔHa,compound = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400)\nΔHa,compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4.

Compare with Options and Check Units**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's look at the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g - The value is correct, but the unit is wrong.\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol - Incorrect value.\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.\n\nLet's check the value for option C by converting our result to kJ/g. We need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\nUsing integer masses for simplicity as is common in these problems: M = 12*12 + 22*1 = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option C.

Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy released when all the gaseous atoms (12 C and 22 H) combine to form one mole of the gaseous compound. This is equal to the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy (ΔH₂)** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4.

So there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** The total number of bonds involving carbon can be calculated. The sum of valencies for 12 carbons is 12 * 4 = 48.

Each bond connects two atoms. Total bonds = (Sum of Valencies)/2.\n        For C12H22, total bonds = (12*4 + 22*1)/2 = (48+22)/2 = 35 bonds.\n        Total bonds = (No. C-C) + (No. C=C) + (No. C-H)\n        35 = (No. C-C) + 2 + 22\n        No. C-C = 35 - 24 = 11.

Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nWe need to count all the covalent bonds within one molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The carbon skeleton consists of 12 carbon atoms. In a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds between the N atoms in the skeleton is N-1. Here, N=12, so there are 12-1 = 11 total bonds (both single and double) connecting the carbon atoms.

Total C = 1 + 1 = 2; Total H = 1 + 3 = 4.\n*   `-CH2-`: This part has 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   `-CH=`: This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: This part has 1 central carbon and 2 methyl groups. Total C = 1 + 2 = 3; Total H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\n\nFrom the structure `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is simply the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `=`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure:\n    *   2 bonds in `(CH3)2C=` (from the central C to the two CH3 groups)\n    *   1 bond between `CH` and `CH2`\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and `CH(CH3)`\n    *   1 bond within `CH(CH3)` (from the chain C to the CH3 group)\n    *   1 bond between `CH(CH3)` and the next `CH2`\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and `CH`\n    *   2 bonds in `=C(CH3)2` (from the central C to the two CH3 groups)\n    Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n*   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n*   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n\n**3.

Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the elements (ΔH_atomization_reactants).**\n\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nGiven data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization_reactants = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nΔH_atomization_reactants = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization_reactants = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\n**5. Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound.**\n\nΔH_f = ΔH_atomization_reactants - ΔH_atomization_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**6. Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nThe options are:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol, while option D is 1900 kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\nWe need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 × (molar mass of C) + 22 × (molar mass of H)\nM ≈ 12 × 12.0 g/mol + 22 × 1.0 g/mol = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert ΔH_f from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we will follow these steps based on Hess's Law and bond energy data. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) can be calculated using the formula:\nΔHf° = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements in their standard states] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (C=) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (=CH) + 1 (=C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 2*3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2*3 = 22 hydrogens.\nThe molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Bonds**\nWe need to determine the number of each type of bond in one molecule of the compound.\n*   **C-H bonds:** Count all hydrogen atoms, as each is bonded to a carbon. There are 22 H atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds: C=CH and CH=C. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can find this by subtracting the carbons in C=C bonds from the total C-C links. Total carbon atoms = 12.\n    The main carbon chain can be visualized as C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C. If all were single bonds, there would be 11 C-C links.\n    The structure has 2 C=C bonds and 9 C-C bonds. Let's verify by drawing and counting:\n    Structure: `(CH3)2=C(1)-CH(2)-CH2(3)-CH(CH3)(4)-CH2(5)-CH(6)=C(CH3)2(7)`\n    - C-C single bonds in the backbone: C1-C2, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. (5 bonds)\n    - C-C single bonds in the side groups:\n        - 2 bonds for (CH3)2 on C1\n        - 1 bond for (CH3) on C4\n        - 2 bonds for (CH3)2 on C7\n    - Total C-C bonds = 4 (in chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 bonds.\nSo, we have:\n*   22 C-H bonds\n*   9 C-C bonds\n*   2 C=C bonds\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H)) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C))\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\nΔH_atomization(compound) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atomization(compound) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(graphite), H2(g)) to gaseous atoms (C(g), H(g)).\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n*   For Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy = 12 × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 × 1000 = 12000 kJ\n*   For Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    Energy = 11 × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 = 1100 kJ\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nΔHf° = [Total enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of compound]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol\n\n**Step 6: Check the Options**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches, but the unit is per gram)\n\nSince our calculated molar enthalpy (1900 kJ/mol) is not an option, but an option with the same number (1900) but different units (kJ/g) exists, let's convert our answer to kJ/g to see if it matches any other option.\n\n**Step 7: Convert Enthalpy of Formation to kJ/g**\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.011) + (22 × 1.008) g/mol ≈ 166.3 g/mol. Using integer masses for simplicity as is common in such problems, M = 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = ΔHf° (in kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (in g/mol)\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.445 kJ/g\n\nThis value (11.445 kJ/g) matches option B (11.44 kJ/g) very well. It is common in multiple-choice questions for the answer to be presented in units that require conversion. Option D has the correct numerical value but incorrect units that would represent a physically enormous and incorrect amount of energy if interpreted as written. Therefore, option B is the most plausible correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nAn enthalpy of formation calculation involves a Hess's Law cycle using atomization energies. The overall process can be thought of in two main steps:\n1.  Breaking the reactants (elements in their standard state) into individual gaseous atoms.\n2.  Forming the product molecule from these gaseous atoms.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the net energy change of this process.\nΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of product)\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecule to find its formula and bond structure.**\nThe molecule is (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH₃)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH₃)₂) = 12 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 6 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH₃)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH₃)₂) = 22 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The formula C₁₂H₂₂ tells us there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds indicated: (CH₃)₂**C=C**H- and -**C=C**(CH₃)₂. This gives **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: For any acyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds is (Number of C atoms) - 1. Here, it is 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the product (the molecule C₁₂H₂₂).**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule. It's the sum of all bond energies.\nΔHₐ(product) = (No. C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nΔHₐ(product) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHₐ(product) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the reactants.**\nThe formation reaction is: 12C(graphite) + 11H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\nWe need to turn 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas into gaseous atoms.\nΔHₐ(reactants) = (12 × ΔHₐ(C)) + (11 × BE_H-H)\nΔHₐ(reactants) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHₐ(reactants) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\nΔHf = ΔHₐ(reactants) - ΔHₐ(product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Check the units of the options.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to see if it matches any option.\n*   Calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n*   Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nAn error occurred during the execution of the code. I will do my best to resolve it and find a solution.\nHere's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the organic molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`. We are given the enthalpy of atomization for carbon and bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the heat change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. We can calculate this using Hess's Law and bond energies. The general formula is:\n\n**ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the molecule)**\n\n### **2. Detailed Steps**\n\n**Step 2a: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   Start from the left:\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: This group has 1 C directly in the chain, and 2 `CH3` groups attached. So, `1 + 2 = 3` carbons and `2 * 3 = 6` hydrogens.\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen in the chain, plus a `CH3` group. So, `1 + 1 = 2` carbons and `1 + 3 = 4` hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 carbon in the chain and 2 `CH3` groups. So, `1 + 2 = 3` carbons and `2 * 3 = 6` hydrogens.\n*   Summing them up:\n    *   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C**\n    *   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**Step 2b: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n`12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`\n\nWe need to calculate the enthalpy change to convert the reactants (elements) into gaseous atoms:\n`12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`\n\n*   **For Carbon**: We need 12 moles of gaseous Carbon atoms from solid Carbon.\n    *   Enthalpy = 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   **For Hydrogen**: We need 22 moles of gaseous Hydrogen atoms from H2 gas. Since we start with H2 molecules, we need to break 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   Enthalpy = 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements**:\n    *   ΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 2c: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the C12H22 molecule. This requires counting all the C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure `(CH3)2C=CH-...-CH=C(CH3)2` clearly shows **2 C=C double bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The total number of bonds between the 12 carbon atoms is `(12 - 1) = 11` in a non-cyclic, saturated skeleton. Here we have two double bonds. The total number of linkages (single or double) between carbon atoms is 11. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Let's verify by counting from the structure:\n    *   (CH**3**)**C**-**C**=(CH**3**) : 2 C-C\n    *   =C-**C**H-**C**H2- : 1 C-C\n    *   -CH2-**C**H(CH**3**)- : 2 C-C\n    *   -CH(CH3)-**C**H2- : 1 C-C\n    *   -CH2-**C**H=**C**(CH3)2: 1 C-C\n    *   =**C**(**C**H3)(**C**H3): 2 C-C\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n    *   Total bonds between carbons = 9 (single) + 2 (double) = 11. This is consistent.\n\n*   **Total Bond Energy Calculation**:\n    *   BE_molecule = (22 * BE(C-H)) + (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C))\n    *   BE_molecule = (22 * 400) + (9 * 200) + (2 * 300)\n    *   BE_molecule = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 2d: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1:\n*   ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(elements) - BE_molecule\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 2e: Check the Options and Convert Units**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the bond energy, not the enthalpy of formation)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value matches the number in option D, but the units are kJ/g. This suggests either a typo in the option's unit or that the intended answer is in kJ/g, requiring a unit conversion. Let's perform the conversion to see if it matches option C.\n\n*   **Calculate Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    *   M = 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\n    *   Using standard atomic weights: M ≈ 12 * 12.01 g/mol + 22 * 1.01 g/mol ≈ 144.12 + 22.22 = 166.34 g/mol.\n    *   (Often in such problems, using integer masses is sufficient: 12 * 12 + 22 * 1 = 166 g/mol)\n\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g**:\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166.34 ≈ **11.42 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value is very close to option C. The python script execution, which used more precise molar masses, confirms this: `Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.4245...`.\n\nTherefore, the calculated enthalpy of formation is ~11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe user wants me to solve a chemistry problem involving enthalpy calculations.\n\n**1.

So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    - **C=C bonds:** The structure is `C=C-C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    - **C-C bonds (single bonds):**\n        - Bonds within the main chain: There are 8 carbons in the chain, so 7 connections. Two are double bonds, so 7 - 2 = 5 single bonds in the chain backbone. Let's re-verify this: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. No, it's `C=C` then a `C-C`, then `C-C`, then `C-C`, then `C=C`. This looks like `C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7`. The single bonds are C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. That's 4 C-C bonds.\n        - Bonds to methyl groups:\n            - `(CH3)2C=` has two C-C bonds.\n            - `-CH(CH3)-` has one C-C bond.\n            - `=C(CH3)2` has two C-C bonds.\n        - Total C-C bonds = 4 (chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 (branches) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Summary of bonds:**\n- 22 C-H bonds\n- 9 C-C bonds\n- 2 C=C bonds\n\n**Step B: Calculate the total energy required to atomize the elements (Reactants).**\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nThe energy to turn reactants into gaseous atoms is:\n- For 12 moles of C(s) → 12 C(g): 12 * ΔHa(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n- For 11 moles of H2(g) → 22 H(g): This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds. 11 * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n- Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step C: Calculate the total bond energy of the product (the compound).**\nThis is the energy released when gaseous atoms form one mole of the compound.

Option A has the right number but wrong units. Option B and C are incorrect. Option D has different units (kJ/g). Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n- Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.008) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n- ΔHf° in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n- This value matches option D.\n\nLet's use the provided python code's output to confirm.\n`Code output: Enthalpy of Formation = 1900.0 kJ/mol`\n`Code output: Enthalpy of Formation = 11.44578313253012 kJ/g`\n\nThe python script calculation (which uses integer atomic masses 12 and 1) gives 11.4457... kJ/g, which rounds to 11.44 kJ/g. This confirms my manual calculation and points directly to option D.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n1.  The enthalpy of formation is calculated as ΔHf° = [Atomization energy of elements] - [Bond energy of compound].\n2.  Atomization energy of elements (12 C + 11 H2) = (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100) = 13100 kJ/mol.\n3.  Bond energy of compound C12H22 (with 9 C-C, 2 C=C, 22 C-H bonds) = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400) = 11200 kJ/mol.\n4.  ΔHf° = 13100 - 11200 = 1900 kJ/mol.\n5.  To convert to kJ/g, we divide by the molar mass (approx. 166 g/mol): 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.44 kJ/g.\n6.

Since the given data are round numbers, we use C=12 and H=1.\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n3.  **Count the Number and Type of Bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 Hydrogen atoms, so there are 22 C-H bonds.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds `(C=C)`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of C-C bonds (single and multiple) is `(number of C atoms) - 1`. Here, it is 12 - 1 = 11. Since there are 2 C=C bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = 9.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule (Enthalpy of Atomization):**\n    *   This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule.\n    *   Energy = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\n    *   Energy = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n    *   Energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):**\n    *   The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g).\n    *   ΔHf = [Energy to atomize reactants] - [Energy to atomize product]\n    *   Energy to atomize reactants = (12 × Enthalpy of atomization of C) + (11 × Bond energy of H-H)\n    *   Energy to atomize reactants = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.\n    *   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g to Match Options:**\n    *   The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g.

There are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** We need to count all single bonds between carbon atoms.\n        *   In the main chain skeleton: C=**C-C**-**C-C**-**C-C**=C. There are 4 C-C single bonds in the main chain.\n        *   Connecting methyl groups: There are five methyl groups (CH3), each attached by a C-C single bond. So, there are 5 more C-C single bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom,compound)**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound.

The molecular formula for the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2` is C12H22. \nTo determine the enthalpy of formation, we first need to ascertain the number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, and C-H bonds present in one molecule of the given compound. Let's break down the structure to count the bonds accurately:\n\nThe molecule's structure is:\n`CH3` `CH3` `CH3`\n`|` `|` `|`\n`H3C — C = CH — CH2 — CH — CH2 — CH = C — CH3`\n`|` `|`\n`CH3` `CH3`\n\n*   C-H bonds: There are eight `CH3` groups (24 H) and two `CH` groups (2 H) and two CH2 groups (4H). Total Hydrogens: 6 + 1 + 2 + (1+3) + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   C=C bonds: The structure clearly shows **2 C=C double bonds**.\n*   C-C single bonds: We count the single bonds connecting the carbon atoms:\n    *   Two bonds connect the first carbon to its two `CH3` groups.\n    *   One bond connects `=CH-` to `-CH2-`.\n    *   One bond connects `-CH2-` to `-CH(CH3)-`.\n    *   One bond connects the `-CH(CH3)-` carbon to its own `CH3` group.\n    *   One bond connects `-CH(CH3)-` to the next `-CH2-`.\n    *   One bond connects `-CH2-` to the `-CH=`.\n    *   Two bonds connect the final `=C<` carbon to its two `CH3` groups.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nWith this information, we proceed with the calculation:\n### 1. Calculation of the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule\nThe total bond energy, which represents the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, is the sum of the energies of all its bonds.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   **Total bond energy of the molecule** = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements\nThis is the energy needed to create 12 moles of gaseous carbon atoms and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen atoms from their standard states.\n\n*   Enthalpy to form 12 moles of C(g): 12 * Enthalpy of atomization of C = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Enthalpy to form 22 moles of H(g): For H, we are given the H-H bond energy. The energy to create one mole of H atoms is half the H-H bond energy. Therefore, the enthalpy of atomization for H is (1/2) * 100 kJ/mol = 50 kJ/mol. So for 22 moles, it's 22 * 50 kJ = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of the elements** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)\nThe enthalpy of formation is given by:\n\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Total bond energy of the molecule)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### 4. Conversion to kJ/g\nThe final step is to convert this value from kJ/mol to kJ/g. First, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n\n*   Molar mass of C = 12.01 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   **Molar mass of C12H22** = (12 * 12.01) + (22 * 1.008) = 144.12 + 22.176 = **166.296 g/mol**. Approximating with integer masses gives 166 g/mol, which is usually sufficient for these problems.\nNow we convert to kJ/g:\n\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166.296 g/mol = **11.425 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value rounds to 11.44 kJ/g, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the calculation for the enthalpy of formation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass\nFirst, let's identify the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   Start with the carbon backbone and attached groups:\n    *   (CH₃)₂C= : This part has 1 central carbon and 2 methyl (CH₃) groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n    *   =CH- : 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   -CH₂- : 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   -CH(CH₃)- : This part has 1 carbon in the main chain and 1 attached methyl group. Total: 2 C, (1+3) = 4 H.\n    *   -CH₂- : 1 C, 2 H.\n    *   -CH= : 1 C, 1 H.\n    *   =C(CH₃)₂ : 1 central carbon and 2 methyl groups. Total: 3 C, 6 H.\n*   Summing these up:\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Hydrogen atoms (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Molar Mass:** Using integer atomic weights (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol) which is standard for this type of problem with simplified data:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Covalent Bonds\nNow, we count each type of bond in the molecule's structure.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms directly gives the number of C-H bonds, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: `C=C` and `CH=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) structure with `n` carbon atoms, there are a total of `n-1` carbon-carbon linkages (both single and double). Here, n=12, so there are 12-1=11 total C-C links. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the rest must be single bonds.\n    Number of C-C bonds = Total links - Number of C=C bonds = 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form individual gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies.\n*   **ΔH_atomization(compound)** = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\n*   Using the given values:\n    *   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   **ΔH_atomization(compound)** = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\n    = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n    = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements\nThis is the energy required to convert the constituent elements in their standard states (solid carbon, gaseous H₂) into individual gaseous atoms needed to form the compound (12 moles of C atoms, 22 moles of H atoms).\n*   **Formation equation:** 12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n*   **Energy to atomize elements (ΔH_atomization(elements))** = (12 × ΔH_atomization(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n*   Using the given values:\n    *   ΔH_atomization(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n    *   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n*   **ΔH_atomization(elements)** = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\n    = 12000 + 1100\n    = **13100 kJ**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\nThe enthalpy of formation of the compound can be found by applying Hess's Law, which results in the following formula:\n*   **ΔH_f = ΔH_atomization(elements) - ΔH_atomization(compound)**\n*   **ΔH_f** = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n    = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 6: Convert to kJ/g and Compare with Options\nThe question asks for the answer in specific units, and the options include both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/g)** = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n*   **ΔH_f (kJ/g)** = 1900 / 166\n\nThe code execution provides the result of this division: 11.44578313253012.\nThis value is approximately **11.45 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n*   A) **11.44 kJ/g** (Matches our calculation)\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol (Incorrect value)\n*   C) 1900 kJ/g (Incorrect unit; our value is 1900 kJ/mol)\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation)\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nTo calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, we will use the principles of thermochemistry involving bond energies and enthalpies of atomization.\n\nThe overall process can be thought of as a Hess's law cycle:\n1.  Atomize the elements in their standard states to form gaseous atoms.\n2.  Combine the gaseous atoms to form one mole of the gaseous compound. The enthalpy change for this step is the negative of the total bond energy of the molecule.\n3.  The sum of the enthalpy changes for these two steps is the enthalpy of formation of the compound.\n\nThe formula is:\nΔH_f = [Enthalpy of atomization of elements] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\n\nThe structure is:\n` (CH3)2  C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C  (CH3)2`\n`            |`\n`           CH3`\n\n*   **Count Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 3 C\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 2 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH=C(CH3)2`: 4 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 12 C\n\n*   **Count Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   Total number of H atoms is 22.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Count the types of bonds:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure. Count = **2**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:**\n        *   Between carbon atoms in the main chain: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. There are 4 C-C single bonds here.\n        *   From the methyl (CH3) groups to the main chain: The `(CH3)2C=` group has 2, the `-CH(CH3)-` group has 1, and the `C(CH3)2` group has 2. Total = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 C-C single bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound. It's the sum of all the bond energies.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Total bond energy (ΔH_atom, compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C as graphite solid, H as H2 gas) to gaseous atoms. We need 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\n*   Formation of 12 moles of C(g) from C(s): `12 C(s) -> 12 C(g)`\n    *   Energy required = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Formation of 22 moles of H(g) from H2(g): `11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)`\n    *   This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   Energy required = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of elements (ΔH_atom, elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom, elements - ΔH_atom, compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options and Convert Units if Necessary**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 1900 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOption B has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol).\nOption D has units of kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to these units.\n\n*   Molar Mass (M) of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value rounds to **11.44 kJ/g** (or 11.45 kJ/g depending on rounding rules), which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nThe user wants me to solve a thermochemistry problem. I will follow the standard procedure for calculating the enthalpy of formation from bond energies and enthalpies of atomization.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecule and Determine the Molecular Formula**\nThe given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nI need to count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to determine the molecular formula, C_xH_y.\n*   (CH3)2C=: 1 C + 2*(1 C) = 3 C; 2*3 = 6 H\n*   =CH-: 1 C, 1 H\n*   -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H\n*   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C + 1 C = 2 C; 1 H + 3 H = 4 H\n*   -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H\n*   -CH=: 1 C, 1 H (There seems to be a typo in the question's formula here, it should be -CH= to have the correct valence for Carbon, but let's re-read the original structure. Oh wait, it is `-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, that's fine.)\n*   =C(CH3)2: 1 C + 2*(1 C) = 3 C; 2*3 = 6 H\n\nLet's recount to be sure:\n- Part 1: (CH3)2C=  -> C3H6\n- Part 2: =CH-       -> C1H1\n- Part 3: -CH2-       -> C1H2\n- Part 4: -CH(CH3)-  -> C2H4\n- Part 5: -CH2-       -> C1H2\n- Part 6: -CH=       -> C1H1\n- Part 7: =C(CH3)2  -> C3H6\n\nWait, there are two double bonds `C=C`. The structure is: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`\nThe chain is `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`. This is a 7 carbon chain with branches.\nLet's just sum the atoms.\n- Total Carbon atoms = (2 * 1) + 1 + 1 + 1 + (1 + 1) + 1 + 1 + (1 * 2) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 12 Carbons. So, x=12.\n- Total Hydrogen atoms = (2 * 3) + 1 + 2 + (1 + 3) + 2 + 1 + (2 * 3) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogens. So, y=22.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\nI will now count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds**: The count is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: From the formula `(CH3)2C=CH-...` and `-CH=C(CH3)2`, it's clear there are **2** C=C double bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The total number of bonds in an acyclic molecule is (Number of atoms - 1).\n    Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\n    Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33.\n    Number of C-C single bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C-H bonds) - (Number of C=C bonds)\n    Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9**.\n    Let's verify by drawing and counting:\n    (CH3)-C(CH3)= -> 2 C-C bonds\n    C=C-C -> 1 C-C bond\n    C-C-C -> 1 C-C bond\n    C-C(CH3)-C -> 2 C-C bonds\n    C-C-C -> 1 C-C bond\n    C-C=C -> 1 C-C bond\n    =C(CH3)-(CH3) -> 2 C-C bonds\n    Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + (1 C-C to chain, 1 C-C to CH3) + 1 + 1 + 2 = wait, this is getting confusing. The formula method is more reliable. Let me redraw carefully.\n    \n      CH3           CH3           CH3\n       |             |             |\n      C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C\n       |                           |\n      CH3                         CH3\n      \n    - C-C bonds in (CH3)2C group: 2\n    - C-C bond between C=C and CH2: 1\n    - C-C bond between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1\n    - C-C bond within CH(CH3): 1\n    - C-C bond between CH(CH3) and CH2: 1\n    - C-C bond between CH2 and CH=C: 1\n    - C-C bond between CH and C=C: 1\n    - C-C bonds in =C(CH3)2 group: 2\n    Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 11. My previous calculation was wrong. Let me re-check.\n\nAh, my drawing to formula link was wrong. Let's trace the chain from the given formula: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n- (CH3)2C-: 2 C-C bonds here.\n- -C=CH-: The double bond.\n- =CH-CH2-: 1 C-C bond.\n- -CH2-CH(CH3)-: 1 C-C bond linking to the CH. Inside the group, there's another C-C to the CH3. That's 2 C-C bonds here.\n- -CH(CH3)-CH2-: 1 C-C bond.\n- -CH2-CH=: 1 C-C bond.\n- =C(CH3)2: 2 C-C bonds here.\nSumming them up: 2 + 1 + 1 (chain) + 1 (branch) + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 C-C bonds. Okay, the first calculation was correct. The structural interpretation is key. `CH(CH3)` is a `CH` in the main chain bonded to a `CH3` group.\n\nSo, counts are confirmed:\n*   9 x C-C bonds\n*   2 x C=C bonds\n*   22 x C-H bonds\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔHa,compound)**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔHa,compound = (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C)) + (22 * BE(C-H))\nGiven bond energies (BE):\nBE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\nBE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\nBE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔHa,compound = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400)\nΔHa,compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔHa,elements)**\nThis is the enthalpy change for the reaction: `12 C(solid) + 11 H2(gas) -> 12 C(gas) + 22 H(gas)`.\nGiven:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C(s) -> C(g)), ΔHa(C) = 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   Bond energy of H-H (H2(g) -> 2H(g)), BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol.\n\nThe total enthalpy change is the sum of the energies to atomize 12 moles of carbon and 11 moles of H2.\nΔHa,elements = (12 * ΔHa(C)) + (11 * BE(H-H))\nΔHa,elements = (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100)\nΔHa,elements = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following relationship:\nΔHf = Σ(Enthalpies of atomization of elements) - Σ(Bond energies of product)\nΔHf = ΔHa,elements - ΔHa,compound\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Compare with Options and Check Units**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's look at the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g - The value is correct, but the unit is wrong.\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol - Incorrect value.\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation.\n\nLet's check the value for option C by converting our result to kJ/g. We need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\nUsing integer masses for simplicity as is common in these problems: M = 12*12 + 22*1 = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g\n\nThis value matches option C. The question implicitly asks for the answer in kJ/g, which makes option C the correct choice.\n\nI am confident in the steps and calculations. The reasoning is sound, and the final value matches one of the options after unit conversion.
