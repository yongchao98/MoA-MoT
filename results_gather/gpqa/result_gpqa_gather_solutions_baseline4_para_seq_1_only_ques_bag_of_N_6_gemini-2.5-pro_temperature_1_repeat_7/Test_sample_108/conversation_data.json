Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN system is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Particle X\nThe process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n*   **Final NN state (`NN_f`)**: It is described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The problem states we should assume its total isospin is `T_{NN_f} = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Governing Rules\nThe reaction must obey several conservation laws and principles. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics (as given)**\n    The problem provides a specific condition from the generalized Pauli exclusion principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are told to assume the final NN state has `T_{NN_f} = 0`. Plugging this into the formula:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**. Any final NN state where `S_f + L_f` is even will violate this condition and is therefore not permitted.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    `P_i = P_f`\n    `P_i = +1` (from the initial `1S0` state).\n    The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    So, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved. `J_i = J_f`.\n    `J_i = 0`. So, the total angular momentum of the final system must be `J_f = 0`.\n    The final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`), the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), and its spin (`s_X`): `vec{J_f} = vec{J_{NN_f}} + vec{l_X} + vec{s_X}`.\n    For `J_f` to be zero, it must be possible to combine these three vectors to get zero. This is a broad condition, but it can be checked for each case. A simpler check, assuming `s_X=0`, would be `J_{NN_f} = l_X`. We will see if this assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of States**\n    The quantum states themselves must be physically possible. For a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions), the total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f` (must be odd?) | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X` (must be odd?) | Rule 4: `S_f` possible? |\n|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) `7D1` | S=3, L=2, J=1 | p (l=1) | 3+2 = 5 (**OK**) | 2+1 = 3 (**OK**) | `S=3` (**Forbidden**) |\n| B) `3D3` | S=1, L=2, J=3 | f (l=3) | 1+2 = 3 (**OK**) | 2+3 = 5 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| C) `3S1` | S=1, L=0, J=1 | p (l=1) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | 0+1 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| D) `3P0` | S=1, L=1, J=0 | s (l=0) | 1+1 = 2 (**Forbidden**) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, we find two forbidden reactions:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3` (`2S+1=7`). This is impossible, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics condition given in the problem. For the final state to have `T=0`, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be odd. For the `3P0` state, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2`, which is even.\n\nWhen a multiple-choice question has two seemingly correct answers, it's often because one violates a condition explicitly provided in the problem statement, which is intended to be the primary focus. The problem explicitly gives the Pauli condition and the requirement that `T(NN_f)=0`. Option D is the only one that fails this specific test. The impossibility of state `7D1` in Option A relies on general background knowledge not explicitly written in the problem's rule set. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the test set up by the problem itself.\n\nThe state `3P0` is a valid NN state, but it must have T=1. The problem asks to consider a hypothetical transition to a `T=0` state. Since a `3P0` state cannot have `T=0`, the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Conservation Laws\n\nWe need to check which of the proposed reactions is forbidden. A reaction is forbidden if it violates a fundamental conservation law or a given physical principle. The relevant principles here are:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The final two-nucleon (NN) state must be consistent with the Pauli principle. The problem provides a specific condition for this.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon system (NN) in a **1S0** state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_initial = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Parity of the initial state:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum L is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   The final state consists of the final NN system and the emitted particle X.\n*   The reaction is: `NN_initial (1S0) -> NN_final + X`.\n\n**A. Conservation of Parity**\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_final` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final`, where `L_final` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given in the problem).\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   Putting it together:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_final + l_X)`\n*   This equation is satisfied only if `(-1)^(L_final + l_X) = -1`, which means the exponent `(L_final + l_X)` must be **odd**.\n\n**B. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial = 0`.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final(NN)`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`).\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X. A common simplification in such problems is to assume X is spinless (like a pion). If `s_X = 0`, then `J_X = l_X`.\n*   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum `J_final = J_final(NN) + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the following condition must hold:\n    `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`:\n    `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   This implies that `(S_final + L_final)` must be **odd**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final` must be odd.\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X` must be odd.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 0`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 1`, `J_final(NN) = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition. **FORBIDDEN.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 0`, `l_X = 0`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 3`, `l_X = 3`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final = 3`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Note:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 (antiparallel) or S=1 (parallel). S=3 is physically impossible for this system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed. However, let's check the transition rules as requested by the problem structure.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: The transition itself obeys all the conservation laws. The reaction is forbidden only because the final product `7D1` is not a possible state for two nucleons.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nComparing the options, option B is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle condition explicitly provided in the problem statement. Option D is forbidden for a different reason: the final state itself is unphysical. In the context of such problems, one should primarily focus on applying the given rules and conservation laws to the transition process. Option B fails one of these explicit checks, making it the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system (`NN_i`).\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial system emits a particle X: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s`: `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p`: `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f`: `l_X = 3`\n\n*   **Final State:** A final two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and particle X.\n    *   The final NN system has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Selection Rules (Conservation Laws)\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of these rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN_f) = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation is true only if `S_f + L_f` is an odd number.\n    *   **Condition 1:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial system (`J_i = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system.\n    *   The final system's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). (We assume particle X has no spin, which is standard for particles like pions denoted by `s, p, ...` states).\n    *   The conservation law is `vec{J_i} = vec{J_f} + vec{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, this implies `vec{J_f} + vec{l_X} = 0`, which can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    *   **Condition 2:** `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state: `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final state's parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given intrinsic parity).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^{l_X}` (parity from the relative motion of X).\n    *   So, the conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`, or `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n    *   This requires the exponent to be odd.\n    *   **Condition 3:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each of the given reactions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Condition 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   The reaction is not permitted.\n\nSince we have already found a violation, this is the answer. For completeness, let's check the other options.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. A two-nucleon system is made of two spin-1/2 particles, so its total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, this reaction is forbidden because the final state cannot exist.\n*   However, if we mechanically apply the selection rules as requested:\n    *   `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n    *   `l_X = 1`.\n    *   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n    *   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    *   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   The process itself obeys all the given selection rules, but it leads to an impossible state. The question asks which *partial wave* is not permitted based on the given rules. Option A is the only one that violates one of those rules directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be odd. In this case, `1 + 1 = 2`, which is even.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers for this state:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the isospin. For the initial state, we have `L_i = 0` and `S_i = 0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the isospin of the initial state to be `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, for the initial state `1S0`: `J_i = 0`, `P_i = +1`, `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. The problem does not specify the spin of X. A common particle emitted in such decays is a pion (π), which has spin `S_X = 0`. We will assume `S_X = 0`, which is standard for this type of problem unless specified otherwise. The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3` respectively.\n*   **Final NN state**: It has isospin `T_f = 0`. Its quantum numbers are given by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n\n**A. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `J_X`. `vec{J}_{final} = vec{J}_f + vec{J}_X`.\n*   With `S_X = 0`, `vec{J}_X = vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = vec{l}_X`, so `J_X = l_X`.\n*   For `vec{J}_{final}` to be zero, we must be able to couple `vec{J}_f` and `vec{l}_X` to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity from their relative orbital motion: `P_{final} = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n*   `P_{NN_f} = (-1)^{L_f}` and `P_X = -1`.\n*   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   For this equation to hold, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem explicitly states the condition from Pauli statistics: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   This, in turn, implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\nA transition is \"not permitted\" if it violates any of these three conditions.\n\n### 3.

Although it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). According to the Pauli principle for a `T_f=0` state, `S_f + L_f` must be odd. Therefore, a `3P0` state with `T=0` cannot exist for a two-nucleon system, and the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe system starts as a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`, we have `2S+1 = 1`, which means the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The particle X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The lowercase letters denote this: `s` (l=0), `p` (l=1), `d` (l=2), `f` (l=3).\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and constraints:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved (`J_final = J_i = 0`), we must have `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:**\n    The parity of the initial state is `P_i = +1`. The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(relative motion)`.\n    `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This equation holds if and only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived conditions:\n1.  `J_f = l_X`\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd\n\n| Option | Reaction               | NN Final State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | `J_f = l_X`? | `L_f + l_X` is odd? | `S_f + L_f` is odd? | Permitted? |\n| :----: | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :--------- |\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`       | S=1, L=1, J=0                        | l=0             | 0 = 0 (Yes)  | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 1 = 2 (**No**)  | **No**     |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`       | S=1, L=2, J=3                        | l=3             | 3 = 3 (Yes)  | 2 + 3 = 5 (Yes)     | 1 + 2 = 3 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`       | S=3, L=2, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 2 + 1 = 3 (Yes)     | 3 + 2 = 5 (Yes)     | Yes*       |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`       | S=1, L=0, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 0 + 1 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n\n\\*Note on Option C: The final state `7D1` implies a spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Thus, the state `7D1` is physically impossible. However, when strictly applying the rules *given in the problem*, this transition is formally allowed. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave based on the provided conservation laws and Pauli condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, reaction A is the only one that violates one of the conditions explicitly derived from the problem statement. It fails the Pauli statistics requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` final state.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (NN_i):** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => `S_i = 0` (total spin).\n    *   `L = S` => `L_i = 0` (orbital angular momentum).\n    *   `J = 0` => `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum).\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** `NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n    *   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to `NN_f` is denoted `L_X`. (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state: `J_i = J_f`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the `NN_f` system's total angular momentum (`J_NN`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle `X` (`L_X`): `J_f = J_NN + L_X`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `J_f = 0`. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_NN = L_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    *   The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state: `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_NN`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(orbital) = (-1)^L_X`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = -(-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L_NN + L_X) = -1`.\n    *   This implies that the sum `L_NN + L_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State (NN_f):**\n    *   The problem states that for the final `NN_f` state, `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   It also provides the condition from the Pauli exclusion principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN_f) = 0`, we get `0 = S_NN + L_NN + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if and only if `S_NN + L_NN` is an odd number.\n\n### 2. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_NN = L_X`\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_NN + L_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** For `T_NN = 0`, `S_NN + L_NN` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state (`7D1`): `2S_NN+1=7` -> `S_NN=3`. `L_NN=2` (D-state). `J_NN=1`.\n*   This state is impossible for a two-nucleon system. Nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, so their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. S=3 is not possible. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3S1`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=0`, `J_NN=1`.\n*   Particle `X` (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   All conditions are met. This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3P0`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=1`, `J_NN=0`.\n*   Particle `X` (`s`): `L_X=0`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**✗**)\n*   The Pauli principle condition is violated. This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3D3`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=2`, `J_NN=3`.\n*   Particle `X` (`f`): `L_X=3`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `3 = 3`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   All conditions are met. This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and C describe non-permitted transitions. However, the reason for A (`S=3`) is that the final state is fundamentally impossible to construct with two nucleons. This is likely a typo in the question. The reason for C is a violation of the specific Pauli statistics rule that the question explicitly asks to be used. The state `3P0` itself is a valid state for two nucleons, but not if it has isospin `T=0`. The transition is forbidden because the final `(T=0, S=1, L=1)` state violates the Pauli principle. Given the explicit instruction in the problem, this is the intended violation to be found.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial system is a pair of nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => `S_i = 0` (Total spin is 0, a singlet state).\n    *   `L = S` => `L_i = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum is 0).\n    *   `J = 0` => `J_i = 0` (Total angular momentum is 0).\n*   The parity of the initial state `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = P_N1 * P_N2 * (-1)^L_i`. Since nucleons have intrinsic parity `+1`, this is `P_i = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_f((2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)) + X(l_X)`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final isospin is `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN)=0`, the condition becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved, so `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X.\n    *   Parity of final NN state: `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   Parity of particle X: `P(X) = P_X_intrinsic * (-1)^{l_X}`. We are given `P_X_intrinsic = -1`. So, `P(X) = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Therefore, `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `vec{J_i} = vec{J_f_total}`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The total final angular momentum `vec{J_f_total}` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum `vec{J_f}` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `vec{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `vec{J_f} + vec{l_X} = 0`.\n    *   This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`. (The vector sum `|J_f - l_X| <= J_total <= J_f + l_X` must include 0).\n\n**Summary of Conditions to Check:**\nA transition is permitted only if all three conditions are met for the final state `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` and the emitted particle `(l_X)`:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the three conditions. The spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum is: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n| Option | Final NN State `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` | Particle `X(l_X)` | `S_f` | `L_f` | `J_f` | `l_X` | (1) `S_f+L_f`=odd? | (2) `L_f+l_X`=odd? | (3) `J_f=l_X`? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A | `3S1` | p | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0+1=1` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | Yes |\n| B | `7D1` | p | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | `3+2=5` (Yes) | `2+1=3` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | Yes * |\n| C | `3D3` | f | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | `1+2=3` (Yes) | `2+3=5` (Yes) | `3=3` (Yes) | Yes |\n| D | `3P0` | s | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | `1+1=2` (No) | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0=0` (Yes) | **No** |\n\n*\\*Note on Option B: The state `7D1` implies `S_f=3`. This is not physically possible for a two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles can only form total spin S=0 or S=1). However, the transition does not violate any of the three rules explicitly tested (Pauli, Parity, Angular Momentum conservation). The violation in Option D is a direct failure of one of these specified rules.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption D is the only transition that violates one of the required conditions. Specifically, the final NN state `3P0` has `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f+L_f = 2` (even). This violates the Pauli principle condition (`S_f+L_f` must be odd) for a `T(NN)=0` final state. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the solution.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n    *   For `1S0`:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L` is 'S' => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J` is '0' => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Reaction:** The initial NN system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the final NN system is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n\n### 2. Establish the Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three rules: angular momentum conservation, parity conservation, and the given Pauli statistics condition.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (`J_{total, f}`).\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X has no intrinsic spin (or it's not coupled), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n    *   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` must be zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    *   The total parity of the initial state (`P_i`) must equal the total parity of the final state (`P_f`).\n    *   `P_i = P_{NN, i} = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   `P_f = P_{NN, f} * P_{X, intrinsic} * P_{X, orbital}`.\n        *   `P_{NN, f} = (-1)^{L_f}` (where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state).\n        *   `P_{X, intrinsic} = -1` (given).\n        *   `P_{X, orbital} = (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This means `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics / Isospin Condition**\n    *   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed reaction against these three rules. A reaction is not permitted if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `0 = 0`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 1 = 2`. **(FAIL)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli/Isospin condition.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `0 + 1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Note: A `7D1` state implies `2S+1=7`, or `S=3`. This is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, where the maximum spin is `S=1`. However, we will test it against the given rules as a formalism.\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `2 + 1 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `3 + 2 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   This reaction is permitted based on the formal rules provided.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly option A violates one of the fundamental rules outlined in the problem. The sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum (`S_f + L_f`) is even, whereas the Pauli/Isospin condition for `T=0` requires it to be odd. Therefore, this partial wave is not permitted.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is `S`, which corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is `0`, so the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n*   `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial system `NN_i` decays into a final two-nucleon system `NN_f` and a particle `X`.\n`NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n\nThe particle `X` has:\n*   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   Orbital angular momentum `l_X` relative to the `NN_f` system. The lowercase letters (`s`, `p`, `f`) denote `l_X = 0, 1, 3` respectively.\n\nWe must apply three main conservation laws and principles:\n\n**a) Parity Conservation:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n`P_initial = P_final`\n`P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P_X * P_orbital`\nThe orbital parity is due to the emitted particle X, which is `(-1)^l_X`. The parity of the final NN state is `(-1)^L_f`.\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\nFor this equation to hold, the exponent `(L_f + l_X + 1)` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**b) Angular Momentum Conservation:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the `NN_f` system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (or its spin is not relevant to the partial wave notation), its angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n`J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum)\nSince `J_i = 0`, the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` must be able to result in 0. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, `J_f = l_X`, or more generally, if `0` is a possible value in the range `|J_f - l_X|` to `|J_f + l_X|`.\n\n**c) Pauli Statistics for the Final State:**\nThe problem states that for the final `NN` state, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T_f + S_f + L_f` being an odd number.\nWe are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the condition: `0 + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\nTherefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nNow we will check each proposed transition against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. The vector sum is `0`. Matches `J_i=0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **This violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. The vector sum can range from `|1-1|=0` to `1+1=2`. Since `0` is a possible result, it can match `J_i=0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f = 3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). An `S=3` state is impossible. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed, and the transition is not permitted. However, it's instructive to check the given rules.\n*   `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. The vector sum can be `0`, `1`, or `2`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition satisfies all the explicitly stated conservation laws and statistical rules. It is only \"not permitted\" because the final NN state is physically impossible, a fact external to the listed rules. Given that option A directly violates one of the stated rules, it is the more likely intended answer.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. The vector sum can range from `|3-3|=0` to `3+3=6`. Since `0` is a possible result, it can match `J_i=0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the Pauli statistics rule (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) that was explicitly given to be checked for a final state with `T_f = 0`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n*   **Initial State**: The system starts with two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. We use the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to find the initial quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` corresponds to an initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` indicates the total initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Parity**: The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. Therefore, the initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **The Reaction**: The NN system emits a particle X, so the reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: We are given that particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum state is denoted by a lowercase letter (s, p, d, f), which corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`, respectively.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the final state (`J_f`) must equal the total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i`).\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final state consists of `NN_final` (with total angular momentum `J_f(NN)`) and particle `X` (with orbital angular momentum `l_X`). We assume X is spinless. The total final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of `J_f(NN)` and `l_X`.\n    *   For the vector sum `J_f(NN) + l_X` to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity**: The parity of the final state (`P_f`) must equal the parity of the initial state (`P_i`).\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_system)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`, where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P(X_system) = P_X * (-1)^l_X = (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   For `P_f = +1`, we must have `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X` to be **odd**.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for Nucleons**: The problem provides a specific rule for the final NN state when its isospin `T(NN) = 0`:\n    *   `T(NN) = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option Against the Conditions\n\nLet's create a checklist for each reaction. A reaction is permitted only if it passes all three tests.\n1.  **J-Conservation**: `J_f(NN) = l_X`?\n2.  **P-Conservation**: `L_f + l_X` is odd?\n3.  **Pauli Principle**: `S_f + L_f` is odd?\n\n---\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   `NN_final` state is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓ Yes)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓ Yes)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓ Yes)\n*   **Conclusion**: This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n---\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   `NN_final` state is `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (✓ Yes)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓ Yes)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Yes)\n*   **Conclusion**: This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n---\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   `NN_final` state is `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state is `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (✓ Yes)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Yes)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**✗ No**, this is even).\n*   **Conclusion**: This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics constraint.\n\n---\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   `NN_final` state is `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (✓ Yes)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓ Yes)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓ Yes)\n*   **Conclusion**: This reaction is permitted based on the rules explicitly given in the problem. (Note: While a `S=3` state is physically impossible for two nucleons, the reaction does not violate any of the rules we were instructed to use).\n\nBased on the analysis, the only reaction that fails the specified conditions is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the permitted and non-permitted transitions.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe system starts as a bound two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN state is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the total orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe initial state decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\nWe are given the following information and must apply the corresponding conservation laws:\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   The transition must conserve total angular momentum and parity.\n*   The final NN state must obey the Pauli statistics rule provided.\n\nLet's establish the rules that a permitted transition must satisfy. The quantum numbers for the final NN state are `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and for particle X, the orbital angular momentum is `l_X`.\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe initial total angular momentum `J_i` must equal the final total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n*   `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum)\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, this means `0 = J_f + l_X`.\n*   This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe initial total parity `P_i` must equal the final total parity `P_f`.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final NN state (`P_{NN,f} = (-1)^{L_f}`), the orbital parity of particle X (`(-1)^{l_X}`), and the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P_X = -1`).\n*   `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides the condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For the final state, we are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3.

(✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **permitted** according to the given rules.\n\nThe only transition that fails to satisfy all the required conditions is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to check each proposed reaction against three main rules:\n1.  The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n2.  The conservation of total angular momentum (J).\n3.  The conservation of parity (P).\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state (`i`):\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => `S_i = 0` (total spin)\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) => `L_i = 0` (orbital angular momentum)\n    *   `J = 0` => `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum)\n\n*   **Parity of the initial state (`P_i`)**: The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Isospin of the initial state (`T_i`)**: The generalized Pauli principle for two identical fermions (nucleons) requires their total wave function to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that `L + S + T` must be an odd number.\n    *   For the initial state: `L_i + S_i + T_i = odd`\n    *   `0 + 0 + T_i = odd` => `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is characterized by `J_i^P = 0^+` and `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and an emitted particle `X`.\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get: `0 = (S_f + L_f + 1) mod 2`.\n*   This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity must be conserved: `P_i = P_f`.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the NN system.\n*   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_i = J_f_total`.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The total final angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J_X`).\n*   So, `vec(J_f) + vec(J_X) = 0`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = J_X`.\n*   The total angular momentum of particle X, `J_X`, is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum (`l_X`) and its intrinsic spin (`s_X`): `vec(J_X) = vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`.\n*   The triangle inequality requires `|l_X - s_X| <= J_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n*   Since `J_f = J_X`, the condition is: `|l_X - s_X| <= J_f <= l_X + s_X`. Since `s_X` is not specified, we just need to check if there *exists* a possible non-negative spin `s_X` that satisfies this relation.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` is `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. We need to find `s_X` such that `|1 - s_X| <= 1 <= 1 + s_X`. If `s_X = 1`, `J_X` can be 0, 1, or 2. Thus, `J_X = 1` is possible. **OK.**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` is `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   `X` is `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. We need to find `s_X` such that `|3 - s_X| <= 3 <= 3 + s_X`. If `s_X = 0`, `J_X = 3`. **OK.**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` is `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   `X` is `s`: `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f = 0` state. **NOT PERMITTED.**\n*   This reaction is forbidden. We do not need to check the other rules.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` is `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. If `s_X = 0`, `J_X = 1`. **OK.**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\nThe only reaction that violates the fundamental principles is C, as the final `NN` state (`3P0` with `T=0`) is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n*   The initial system is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (initial total spin).\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies `L_i = 0` (initial orbital angular momentum).\n    *   `J = 0` implies `J_i = 0` (initial total angular momentum).\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n*   The final state consists of a two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   The quantum numbers for the final NN state are `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `l_x` (where `s`=0, `p`=1, `d`=2, `f`=3).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Parity**\n*   Parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n*   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n*   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n*   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_x`.\n*   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_x)`.\n*   Equating `P_initial` and `P_final`: `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_x)`.\n*   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_x) = -1`.\n*   This implies that the sum `L_f + l_x` must be an **odd** number for the transition to be allowed.\n\n**4. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n*   The problem states a requirement from Pauli statistics for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number. `(odd) + 1 = (even) = 0 (mod 2)`.\n*   So, any permitted final NN state must have `S_f + L_f` be an odd number.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f` must also be 0.\n*   `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f(NN)`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_x`). `j_x` itself is the vector sum of its orbital (`l_x`) and spin (`s_x`) angular momenta.\n*   The condition is `vec(J_f(NN)) + vec(l_x) + vec(s_x) = 0`.\n*   This means that the three angular momenta `J_f(NN)`, `l_x`, and `s_x` must be able to form a closed triangle. This is possible if they satisfy the triangle inequality, e.g., `|J_f(NN) - l_x| <= s_x <= J_f(NN) + l_x`. Since the spin `s_x` of particle X is not given, we assume that a suitable `s_x` can exist unless other rules are violated.\n\n**6. Evaluate Each Option**\nLet's check each option against the rules, starting with the most restrictive ones. The Pauli principle provides a strict condition on the allowed final NN states.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state: `p`-wave, so `l_x=1`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   **Parity check:** `L_f + l_x = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   This transition is allowed.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. `S=3` is physically impossible. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed. This transition is not permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1` (P-state), `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state: `s`-wave, so `l_x=0`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T=0` state.\n*   Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state: `f`-wave, so `l_x=3`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   **Parity check:** `L_f + l_x = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   This transition is allowed.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have identified two non-permitted transitions:\n*   B is impossible because the final NN state `7D1` has `S=3`, which cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   C is impossible because the final NN state `3P0` with `T=0` violates the Pauli exclusion principle, a rule explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, you are expected to use the rules given. Option C is ruled out directly by applying the Pauli statistics rule from the problem prompt. While option B is also impossible, it relies on assumed knowledge (addition of angular momentum for two spin-1/2 particles) that is not explicitly stated in the problem's constraints. The violation in C is a direct contradiction of the given premises. Therefore, C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to find the non-permitted transition.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (NN system):** `1S0`\n    *   This is in the `(2S+1)L(J)` notation.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` which means initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` which means initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`).\n    *   To conserve `J`, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).

Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S(initial) = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation for L=0) implies the orbital angular momentum `L(initial) = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J(initial) = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial NN state is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n*   `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Emitted Particle\n\nThe final state consists of the NN system in a new state `(2S'+1)L'(J')` and an emitted particle X.\n*   **Final NN state:** Has isospin `T(NN) = 0`. Its quantum numbers are `S'`, `L'`, and `J'`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3`).\n\n### 3. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nWe must check each potential transition against the fundamental conservation laws and the given Pauli principle constraint.\n\n**A. Parity Conservation:**\nThe total parity must be conserved.\n`P(initial) = P(final)`\n`P(initial_NN) = P(final_NN) * P(X) * P(orbital)`\nwhere `P(orbital) = (-1)^l(X)` is the parity of the relative motion between the final NN system and particle X.\n*   `+1 = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n*   `+1 = (-1)^(L' + l(X) + 1)`\nThis equation holds true only if the exponent `L' + l(X) + 1` is an even number. This means `L' + l(X)` must be **odd**.\n*   **Rule 1: `L' + l(X)` must be odd.**\n\n**B. Angular Momentum Conservation:**\nThe total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J'` and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X is spinless (as is common in such problems unless specified otherwise), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l(X)`.\n`J(initial) = J(final_NN) + l(X)` (vector sum)\n`0 = J' + l(X)`\nThis vector addition requires that the magnitudes be equal.\n*   **Rule 2: `J' = l(X)`**\n\n**C. Pauli Principle:**\nThe problem explicitly states a requirement from Pauli statistics for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven that the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, we have:\n`0 = S' + L' + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means `S' + L' + 1` must be an even number, which implies `S' + L'` must be **odd**.\n*   **Rule 3: `S' + L'` must be odd.**\n\n### 4.

Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Transitions A and C are permitted as they satisfy all three rules.\n*   Transition B involves a final state `7D1`. This implies `2S'+1=7`, so `S'=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A spin of `S=3` is impossible. Therefore, this transition is forbidden because the final state cannot exist.\n*   Transition D involves a final state `3P0` with `S'=1` and `L'=1`. For this transition, `S'+L' = 1+1=2`, which is even. This violates Rule 3, which requires `S'+L'` to be odd for a `T=0` final state.\n\nBoth B and D are forbidden transitions. However, the question specifically provides the Pauli statistics rule and asks you to use it along with conservation laws. Option D is the only one that violates this explicitly stated rule (`T = S+L+1 mod 2` for `T=0`). The violation in option B stems from a more basic principle of spin addition that is assumed as prerequisite knowledge, not from the rules explicitly highlighted in the problem prompt. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the specific test mentioned in the question.\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final NN state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) has `S+L=2` (even), which is forbidden by the Pauli principle for a `T=0` state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation for L=0) implies the orbital angular momentum `L(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   **Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X: `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f...`) denotes its orbital angular momentum state, `L(X)`. So, `s` means `L(X)=0`, `p` means `L(X)=1`, `f` means `L(X)=3`.\n    *   We will assume particle X has no spin (`S(X)=0`), so its total angular momentum is `J(X) = L(X)`. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN final) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Conservation Laws and Principles\n\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant physical laws. The key ones here are:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As nucleons are identical fermions, the total wavefunction of the two-nucleon system must be antisymmetric under their exchange.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Conditions for a Permitted Reaction\n\nLet's translate the laws into specific conditions for this problem. Let `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f` be the quantum numbers for the final NN state.\n\n1.  **J-Conservation:**\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`J(X) = L(X)`).\n    *   `vec(J(initial)) = vec(J_f) + vec(J(X))`\n    *   `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(L_X)`\n    *   This implies that the vectors must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For the quantum numbers, this means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:**\n    *   The parity of a system is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`. For a two-nucleon system, the intrinsic parity is `(+1)*(+1)=+1`.\n    *   `P(initial) = P(NN, 1S0) = (-1)^L(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN, final) * P(X, intrinsic) * P(X, orbital)`\n    *   `P(final) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L(X) = (-1)^(L_f + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P(initial) = P(final)`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + L(X) + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the condition as `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to the standard requirement that `L+S+T` must be odd for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Plugging this into the condition: `L_f + S_f + 0` must be odd.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + S_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 4. Test Each Option Against the Conditions\n\nA reaction is forbidden if it fails even one of these three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2` (D-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X)=1`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `1 = 1`.

(Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0` (S-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X)=1`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `0 + 1 = 1`.

(Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1` (P-state), `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `L(X)=0`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `1 + 1 = 2`. (Fail)\n*   The sum `L_f + S_f` is even, which violates the Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon state with `T_f = 0`. Therefore, the final state `NN(3P0)` with `T=0` cannot exist.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it requires the formation of a final `3P0` two-nucleon state with `T=0`, which is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`. This is a spin-singlet state.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Decay and Final State\n\nThe decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n\n### 3. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for a transition to be permitted:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics:** The problem gives a specific constraint for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since we are given `T(NN_f) = 0`, the rule becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Therefore, the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN system (`S_f + L_f`) must be an **odd** integer.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved, so `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n        *   `P_orbital` is the parity from the relative orbital motion of the final particles, given by `(-1)^{l_X}`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`). For the total to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n    *   The particle X is emitted in a specific angular momentum state (`s`, `p`, `f`, etc.), which defines its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. In problems of this type, unless specified otherwise, the emitted particle `X` is typically assumed to be spinless (like a pion), so its spin `s_X = 0`. In this case, `j_X = l_X + s_X = l_X`.\n    *   Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum requires `J_f = l_X`.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each proposed final state against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them. The spectroscopic notation for `l_X` is `s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted by the given rules. (Note: A spin `S=3` state is physically impossible for two nucleons, but the question asks to check the transition rules, and this option passes them).\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION**. This violates the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   Because this transition violates the Pauli statistics constraint, it is **not permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates one of the fundamental rules specified in the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\nThe initial system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` (spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum) means `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum of the initial system is `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe initial parity `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = P_N * P_N * (-1)^L_i`. Since nucleons have intrinsic parity `P_N = +1`, this gives `P_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe system decays into a final two-nucleon state (`NN_f`) and a particle `X`.\n`1S0 -> NN_f + X`\n\nWe must apply three main rules as specified in the problem:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state**: The problem gives the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. It also specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This is equivalent to stating that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number for the reaction to be allowed.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity must be conserved, so `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l`, where `l` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the final NN system.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   The problem states particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l = -(-1)^(L_f + l)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_i = P_f`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l)`.\n    *   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l) = -1`, which means `L_f + l` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J_i = J_f`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum `J(NN_f)` and particle X's total angular momentum `J(X)`.\n    *   The term symbol for `NN_f` gives us `J(NN_f)`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`) gives us the orbital angular momentum `l` of particle X. Assuming particle X is spinless (which is standard unless specified otherwise), its total angular momentum is `J(X) = l`.\n    *   So, `J_f` results from coupling `J(NN_f)` and `l`. For `J_f` to be `0`, it must be possible to obtain `0` from the vector addition, which requires `J(NN_f)` and `l` to be in a coupling that includes `0`. This is possible if `|J(NN_f) - l| <= 0 <= J(NN_f) + l`, which is always true if `J(NN_f) = l`. More generally, we just need `0` to be a possible outcome of the vector sum.\n\n### 3.

Vector sum `|0-0|...|0+0|` is `0`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle condition for a `T=0` final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f`: `3D3` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J(NN_f)=3`.\n*   `X`: `f`-wave -> `l=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=3`, `l=3`. Vector sum `|3-3|...|3+3|` is `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f`: `7D1` -> `2S+1=7` so `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J(NN_f)=1`.\n*   `X`: `p`-wave -> `l=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have total spin S=0 or S=1. Thus, `S=3` is physically impossible. However, the question asks us to check the given rules. Let's strictly apply the rules from the prompt.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=1`, `l=1`. Vector sum `|1-1|...|1+1|` is `0, 1, 2`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: According to the specific rules given in the problem, this reaction is permitted. The reason it's truly impossible is that the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons, a fact that is outside the explicit checklist provided in the question's text.\n\n### Final Decision\nComparing the options, only reaction B violates one of the explicit conditions given in the problem statement (the Pauli statistics rule for T=0). Therefore, it is the one that is \"not permitted\" based on the problem's constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` denotes the initial total orbital angular momentum, which corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the initial total angular momentum of the NN system, so `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial NN state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n*   `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial NN system emits a particle X, leading to the reaction: `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n\nWe must apply the conservation of total angular momentum and parity.\n\n**A. Angular Momentum Conservation:**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved. The initial state has `J_i = 0`. The final state consists of the final NN system (with its own total angular momentum `j_f`) and the particle X (with orbital angular momentum `l_X` relative to the NN system). Particle X is stated to be spinless as its state is denoted by a lowercase letter for orbital angular momentum.\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_i = j_f + l_X` (vector sum)\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, the vector sum of `j_f` and `l_X` must be zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `j_f = l_X`.\n\n**B. Parity Conservation:**\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_initial = +1` (as calculated above).\n*   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`, where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given in the problem).\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`, which is the parity associated with the orbital motion of particle X.\n*   So, the conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n*   `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n*   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l_X` is an odd number.\n\n### 3. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe problem provides a specific condition based on Pauli statistics for the final NN state:\n*   `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\nWe are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`. Substituting this into the formula:\n*   `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation requires the sum `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number. This is equivalent to requiring `S_f + L_f` to be an odd number.\n\n### 4. Summary of Conditions for an Allowed Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met for the final state:\n1.  **Pauli Condition:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **J Conservation:** `j_f = l_X`.\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each of the given transitions against these three rules.

This state is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. While this immediately disqualifies the transition, for completeness, let's check the rules given in the problem. `L_f=2`, `j_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.** (Based on the numbers given)\n2.  **J-Cons:** `j_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **P-Cons:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition satisfies all the dynamic rules provided in the prompt.

Therefore, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWe have identified two non-permitted transitions:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` (S=3) cannot be formed from two nucleons.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule given in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks you to use the provided information, which includes the specific formulation of the Pauli principle (`T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`) and the condition `T=0`. Option D is the only one that fails this explicit check. The issue with option B is a more fundamental fact about the composition of the system, which is not part of the explicit rules the question directs you to use. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that is invalidated by the specific rules provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_initial = 0`.\n*   `L` is `S`, which in spectroscopic notation means orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n*   `J` is `0`, so the total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and the Emitted Particle\nThe system transitions to a final state consisting of a two-nucleon system (`NN_final`) and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   **Particle X:** It has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, is denoted by the lowercase letters (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN state:** The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_final_NN = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must obey several rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\n    The problem explicitly states a requirement from Pauli statistics for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Since we are given `T(NN) = 0`, the condition becomes:\n    `0 = S_final_NN + L_final_NN + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_final_NN + L_final_NN = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_final_NN + L_final_NN = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means the sum of the final NN state's spin (`S_final_NN`) and orbital angular momentum (`L_final_NN`) must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (`J_initial = J_final`).\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_final_NN`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X`). We assume X is a spinless particle (like a pion), so its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   The conservation law is `vec{J_initial} = vec{J_final_NN} + vec{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `vec{J_initial} = 0`, we must have `vec{J_final_NN} + vec{l_X} = 0`. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_final_NN = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state (`P_initial = P_final`).\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P_final_NN * P_X * P_orbital`.\n    *   `P_final_NN = (-1)^L_final_NN`.\n    *   `P_X = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the wavefunction for relative motion).\n    *   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_final_NN * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L_final_NN + l_X)`.\n    *   The conservation law is `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_final_NN + l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `(-1)^(L_final_NN + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_final_NN + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` => `S=3`. `L=2, J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the Pauli principle requirement** that `S+L` must be odd for a T=0 state.\n*   Let's check the other rules for completeness.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state `3P0` with `T=0` is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions. However, they are forbidden for different reasons.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system (spin cannot be 3). This is often considered a typo in such problems.\n*   Option D is forbidden because it violates a specific selection rule (`S+L` must be odd for T=0) that was explicitly provided in the problem statement as a consequence of Pauli statistics.\n\nIn the context of a physics problem, when a specific rule is given, you are expected to use it. Option D is the only one that violates this explicitly stated rule. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers using the notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S' => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is '0' => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe intrinsic parity of the initial NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule: `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where `T` is the total isospin. For the initial `1S0` state (`L_i=0, S_i=0`), we have `(-1)^(0+0+T_i) = -1`, which means `(-1)^(T_i) = -1`. This requires `T_i` to be odd. The lowest possible value is `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe system decays as `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply several rules to determine if a transition is permitted.\n\n**Constraint 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt also specifies that the final NN state has `T(NN, final) = 0`.\nSubstituting `T=0` into the given rule:\n`0 = S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means that `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1` must be an even number.\nThis is equivalent to requiring `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_f`\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system, `J(NN, final)`, and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\nSo, `J_f = J(NN, final) + L(X)`.\nFor `J_f` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN, final) = L(X)`.\n\n**Constraint 3: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n`P_i = P_f`\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN, final) * P(X) * (-1)^(L(X))`.\n*   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^(L(NN, final))`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `(-1)^(L(X))` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of X.\n\nSo, the conservation equation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final)) * (-1) * (-1)^(L(X))`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\n`-1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\nThis requires the exponent `L(NN, final) + L(X)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\nWe now apply these three constraints to each proposed final state. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these constraints. The lowercase letters (s, p, f) denote `L(X)`: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). The sum must be odd. **This rule is VIOLATED.**\n*   Constraint 2 (J conservation): `J(NN)=0`, `L(X)=0`. `0=0`. (Satisfied).\n*   Constraint 3 (P conservation): `L(NN) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nSince the Pauli principle is violated, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=3`, `L(X)=3`. `3=3`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: This notation implies `2S+1=7`, which means `S=3`.\n*   A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their spins can only combine to a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system to have `S=3`.\n*   Therefore, the final state `7D1` does not exist for this system, and the transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=1`, `L(X)=1`. `1=1`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" transitions:\n*   A) is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state.\n*   C) is not permitted because the proposed final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, a physically impossible state like `7D1` is almost always a typo. The question is designed to test the application of conservation laws and symmetry principles to the dynamics of the decay. Option A represents a transition between two valid states that is forbidden by one of these specific principles given in the problem. This is a much more likely intended answer than one that relies on identifying a typo. Assuming `C` was a typo for a valid state like `3D1` (which would be a permitted transition), then `A` is the unique answer that is not permitted due to the violation of the physical laws governing the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the intended answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => The total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` => The initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` => The total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`. This is consistent since `J_i` must be between `|L_i - S_i|` and `L_i + S_i`, which is just 0.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Reaction and Final State\nThe reaction is the emission of a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Represented by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   **Final System:** `NN(final) + X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nWe need to check three conditions for the reaction to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `J_initial` = `J_i` = 0.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `J_final` can range from `|J_f - l_X|` to `J_f + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be equal to `J_initial = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J_f = l_X`** (C1)\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `P_initial` = Parity of the NN(1S0) state = `(-1)^L_i` = `(-1)^0` = `+1`.\n*   `P_final` = `P_NN(final) * P_X(emitted)`.\n    *   `P_NN(final)` = `(-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P_X(emitted)` = `P_X(intrinsic) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that:\n    **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.** (C2)\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides a specific constraint derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, assuming its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n*   Given: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This can be rearranged to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means that:\n    **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.** (C3)\n\nA reaction is \"not permitted\" if it violates at least one of these three conditions.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (3S1): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (p): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n    *   C2: `L_f + l_X` = odd? => `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n    *   C3: `S_f + L_f` = odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   **Result: Permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (3D3): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (f): `l_X = 3`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `3 = 3`. (✓)\n    *   C2: `L_f + l_X` = odd? => `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n    *   C3: `S_f + L_f` = odd? => `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   **Result: Permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (7D1): `2S_f+1 = 7` => `S_f = 3`. `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   This state itself is unphysical. Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions, so their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is impossible for two nucleons to form an `S=3` state. Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state cannot exist. However, let's check the given selection rules for completeness.\n*   Particle X (p): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n    *   C2: `L_f + l_X` = odd? => `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n    *   C3: `S_f + L_f` = odd? => `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n*   **Result: Not permitted** because the final state is unphysical. It does not violate the three specific transition rules given.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (3P0): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (s): `l_X = 0`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `0 = 0`. (✓)\n    *   C2: `L_f + l_X` = odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n    *   C3: `S_f + L_f` = odd? => `1 + 1 = 2`. (**✗**)\n*   **Result: Not permitted.** This reaction violates the Pauli statistics constraint given in the problem statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have identified two forbidden reactions:\n*   **C** is forbidden because the final NN state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **D** is forbidden because it violates one of the specific rules provided in the question (the Pauli constraint).\n\nThe question asks us to identify the non-permitted partial wave by making use of the conservation laws and the specific Pauli statistics rule. Reaction D is the one that is disallowed specifically by these rules. Reaction C is disallowed for a more fundamental reason (the composition of the NN system) that precedes the application of the reaction rules. Therefore, the most direct answer to the question as posed is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_initial + 1 = 1`  => `S_initial = 0` (Total spin of the two nucleons is 0, a singlet state).\n*   `L = S` => `L_initial = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons is 0).\n*   `J = 0` => `J_initial = 0` (Total angular momentum of the initial NN system).\n*   **Parity of the initial NN state (`P_initial_NN`)**: The parity of a two-particle system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_initial_NN = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`. We need to check several rules for each proposed final state.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**: The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final state has isospin `T_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_final = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_final + L_final` must be an **odd number**. This is a critical selection rule for the final NN state.\n\n*   **Parity Conservation**: The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial_total = P_final_total`\n    *   `P_initial_total` is the parity of the initial `1S0` NN state, which is `+1`.\n    *   `P_final_total = P_final_NN * P_X * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P_final_NN = (-1)^L_final` (parity of the final NN internal state).\n        *   `P_X = -1` (intrinsic parity of particle X, given).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the relative motion between X and the final NN system, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of X).\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = ((-1)^L_final) * (-1) * ((-1)^l_X)`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_final + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the angular momenta in the final state: the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final`) and the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   The total angular momentum of X is `j_X`, which is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`.\n    *   The conservation law is `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final) + vec(j_X)` or `0 = vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`.\n    *   This means the three vectors `vec(J_final)`, `vec(l_X)`, and `vec(s_X)` must form a closed triangle (their vector sum is zero). A consequence of this is the triangle inequality: `|J_final - l_X| <= s_X <= J_final + l_X`.\n    *   A common simplification occurs if particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), like a pion (`π`). In that case, `vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_final = l_X`. We will check this simpler case first, but the general case allows for a range of `s_X`.\n\n*   **Fundamental Constraints on NN states**: A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other value of S is impossible.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these rules. The final state is `(2S+1)L(J) + l_X`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=2`, `J_final=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is a valid spin for an NN system.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=3`, `l_X=3`. We need `|3 - 3| <= s_X <= 3 + 3`, so `0 <= s_X <= 6`. This is possible if X has spin `s_X` in this range (e.g., `s_X=0, 1, 2, ...`).\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final=3`. `L_final=2`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S_final=3` is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system. The maximum spin is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`.\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**. The final NN state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=0`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is valid.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang.

This violates the generalized Pauli principle as specified in the problem.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" reactions: B and D.\n*   **B is not permitted** because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   **D is not permitted** because it violates the specific selection rule (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`) that the problem instructed us to use for a `T_final=0` state.\n\nSince the problem explicitly provides the Pauli statistics rule and the condition `T(NN)=0`, it is highly probable that the question is designed to test the application of this specific rule. Option D is the one that fails this test. While option B is also impossible, it's due to a more fundamental property of nucleons not explicitly mentioned in the problem prompt. The key violation in D relates directly to the information provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0` (singlet state).\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State\nThe final state consists of the NN system and an emitted particle X.\n`NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   Unless specified otherwise, we can assume particle X is spinless (`s_X = 0`), so its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Its quantum numbers are denoted `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n    *   We are given that its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for each potential reaction:\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`).\n*   `J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, `J_f` and `j_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   Assuming `s_X = 0`, we have `j_X = l_X`. So, the condition simplifies to **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital parity: `P_f(total) = P_f(NN) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n*   `P(orbital)` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of the final particles, which is `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f(total) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be even: `L_f + l_X + 1 = 2n`.\n*   This simplifies to the condition that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states a specific requirement for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   So, `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For this equation to hold, `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n*   This means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3` (from `2S+1=7`), `L_f = 2` (D), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted by all three given rules. (Note: A `7D1` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, but it passes the specific rules we were asked to check.)\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **(✗ This is an even number, which violates the condition.)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is 'S' => Total initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is '0' => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity of the NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The system emits a particle X. The reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by `l_X` (where s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   We assume particle X is a meson (like a pion), which has intrinsic spin `s_X = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A final NN state described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and particle X.\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   Since we assume `s_X=0`, `j_X = l_X`.\n*   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n*   For `J_i = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is `P_f = P_f(NN) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n*   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n*   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:**\n*   The problem provides the rule for the final NN state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means `T_f` and `S_f + L_f + 1` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n*   The problem states that we must suppose `T_f = 0` (even).\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f + 1` must also be even.\n*   For `S_f + L_f + 1` to be even, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now check each proposed transition against these three rules. A transition is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   *Note*: A two-nucleon system cannot have `S=3`. However, we will check against the rules provided in the problem statement.\n*   **Rule (a) J-conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. (Pass)\n*   **Rule (b) P-conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Rule (c) Pauli principle:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). (Pass)\n*   According to the rules derived from the problem, this transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 3`.\n*   Emitted particle `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule (a) J-conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. (Pass)\n*   **Rule (b) P-conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Rule (c) Pauli principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (Pass)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0` (S-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule (a) J-conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. (Pass)\n*   **Rule (b) P-conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Rule (c) Pauli principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1` (P-wave), `J_f = 0`.\n*   Emitted particle `s`: `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule (a) J-conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. (Pass)\n*   **Rule (b) P-conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Rule (c) Pauli principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(Fail)**\n*   This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the selection rules derived from the problem statement, specifically the Pauli exclusion principle for a final state with `T_f=0`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` (for L) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity of the initial state:** The parity of an NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin of the initial state:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the rule that the sum of isospin (T), spin (S), and orbital angular momentum (L) must be an odd integer: `L + S + T = odd`.\n    *   For the initial state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i = odd`, which means the initial isospin must be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Rules for the Decay\n\nThe decay process is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given several rules to check if a decay is permitted.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter: `s` (`l_X=0`), `p` (`l_X=1`), `d` (`l_X=2`), `f` (`l_X=3`).\n    *   The spin of particle X (`s_X`) is not given. We will assume it's a spin-0 particle, which is common in such problems (e.g., a pion). This is a reasonable assumption that simplifies the angular momentum conservation.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem explicitly states: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Rearranging this gives `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 (mod 2)`, which means the sum `T_f + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    *   Since we are given `T_f = 0`, this simplifies to the condition that **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   This implies that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    *   Total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n    *   Assuming particle X has spin `s_X = 0`, its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is `\\vec{J}_{f,tot} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{l_X}`.\n    *   For this to equal zero, the vectors `\\vec{J_f}` and `\\vec{l_X}` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). -> **FAIL**. The sum must be odd.\n*   Since this decay violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state (which is given as a mandatory condition), this partial wave is not permitted. We can stop here, but let's check the other rules for completeness.\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is forbidden due to the violation of the Pauli principle.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   This option describes a final NN state `7D1`. The `7` means `2S+1=7`, which implies `S_f=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. Therefore, this state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   However, if we mechanically apply the rules given in the problem:\n    *   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n    *   Particle X state `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n    1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). -> **OK**\n    2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). -> **OK**\n    3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay passes all the checks given in the problem. The issue is with the physical existence of the state, not the process itself according to the given rules. Option B is the only one that fails a rule explicitly provided for checking the process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe partial wave described in option B, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`, is not permitted because the final two-nucleon state `3P0` with isospin `T=0` violates the generalized Pauli exclusion principle (`S_f + L_f` is even, not odd). This directly contradicts one of the conditions specified in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system (`NN_i`).\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (total spin).\n*   `L` is 'S', which means `L_i = 0` (total orbital angular momentum).\n*   `J` is 0, so `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum).\n\nWe also need the initial isospin, `T_i`. The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical fermions (like two nucleons) states that the total wavefunction `Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial * Ψ_spin * Ψ_isospin` must be antisymmetric upon exchange of the two particles.\n*   The symmetry of the spatial part is `(-1)^L`. For `L_i = 0`, it's symmetric.\n*   The symmetry of the spin part for two spin-1/2 particles is symmetric for `S=1` (triplet) and antisymmetric for `S=0` (singlet). For `S_i = 0`, it's antisymmetric.\n*   The symmetry of the isospin part is symmetric for `T=1` (triplet) and antisymmetric for `T=0` (singlet).\n*   For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric: `(symmetric)_spatial * (antisymmetric)_spin * (Ψ_isospin)` must be antisymmetric. This requires `Ψ_isospin` to be symmetric, which corresponds to `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `1S0` with `J_i=0`, Parity `P_i = +1`, and `T_i = 1`.\n\nThe problem provides a formula which is a consequence of this principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `L+S+T` being an odd integer. For the initial state `1S0`: `L_i=0, S_i=0`, so `0+0+T_i` must be odd, which confirms `T_i` must be odd (`T_i=1`).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   `NN_f` is the final two-nucleon state, given in each option. We are told `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (`s` for 0, `p` for 1, etc.).\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**I. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem states `T(NN)_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven `T(NN)_f = 0`, we have `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\nTherefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is our first selection rule.\n\n**II. Parity Conservation:**\n`P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_initial = P(NN_i) = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`. (We can ignore the intrinsic parities of the nucleons as they appear on both sides).\n*   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_X = ((-1)^{L_f}) * (P_X_intrinsic * (-1)^{l_X})`.\n*   Given `P_X_intrinsic = -1`, we have `P_final = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n*   So, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n*   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n*   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number. This is our second selection rule.\n\n**III. Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n`J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum), where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n*   `J_i = 0`. This implies `J_f` and `j_X` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`J_f = j_X`).\n*   The total angular momentum of X is `j_X = l_X + s_X` (vector sum), where `s_X` is the spin of X.\n*   Let's check isospin conservation: `T_i = T_f + t_X` (vector sum). `1 = 0 + t_X`, so `t_X=1`. Particle X must have isospin 1. The lightest such particles are pions, which are pseudoscalar bosons (`P=-1, s_X=0`). Assuming X is a pion-like particle, its spin is `s_X=0`.\n*   If `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l_X`. The conservation law becomes `J_f = l_X`. This is our third selection rule.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived selection rules:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X`.\n\n| Option | Final State `NN_f`: `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` | Particle `X`: `l_X` | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f`=odd? | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X`=odd? | Rule 3: `J_f=l_X`? | Permitted? |\n|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | `S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0+1=1` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | **Permitted** |\n| B) | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | `S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0` | `l_X=0` | `1+1=2` (No) | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0=0` (Yes) | **Not Permitted** |\n| C) | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | `S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3` | `l_X=3` | `1+2=3` (Yes) | `2+3=5` (Yes) | `3=3` (Yes) | **Permitted** |\n| D) | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | `S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `3+2=5` (Yes) | `2+1=3` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | **Not Permitted** |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   Options A and C satisfy all three selection rules and are therefore permitted transitions.\n*   Option B violates Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` must be odd, but `1+1=2` is even). This rule stems directly from the Pauli principle as applied to the final `T_f=0` state. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n*   Option D appears to satisfy all three selection rules. However, the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S_f=3` (since `2S_f+1=7`). A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A spin of `S=3` is impossible. Thus, the final state is unphysical, and the reaction is forbidden for this fundamental reason.\n\nWe have two forbidden transitions, B and D. However, the question asks us to use the Pauli statistics and conservation laws. The transition in B is forbidden specifically by the Pauli principle requirement. The issue with D is the impossibility of the state itself, which is a piece of external knowledge not derived from the conservation laws of the reaction. In such problems, the violation of a specific rule given or implied in the problem statement is typically the intended answer. Option B is the only one that violates the selection rules governing the process.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires us to check which of the proposed nuclear decay processes is forbidden. We need to check each option against the principles of conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle as applied to the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\nThe term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n-   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` => `S(initial) = 0`.\n-   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The 'S' in `1S0` means `L(initial) = 0`.\n-   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The '0' in `1S0` means `J(initial) = 0`.\n-   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe decay is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\nWe are given that particle X has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f...) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system. We will assume particle X is spinless (like a pion, a common scenario), so its total angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum, `J(NN_final)`, and the particle X's angular momentum, `l_X`. To conserve `J`, the vector sum must be zero. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal:\n`J(NN_final) = l_X`.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\nThe initial parity is `P(initial) = +1`.\nThe final parity is `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n-   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`\n-   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n-   `P(orbital) = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the relative motion between X and NN_final)\nSo, `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`.\nFor parity to be conserved, `P(initial) = P(final)`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`.\nThis simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`, which means the exponent must be odd:\n`L(NN_final) + l_X = odd`.\n\n**c) Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nWe are given that the final state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the rule:\n`0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis means that the expression `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1` must be an even number. For this to be true, the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number:\n`S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) = odd`.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`. `L=D` -> `L=2`. `J=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*However, a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin S=3. Two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form S=0 or S=1. So, the state `7D1` is unphysical for an NN system. This reaction is not permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n-   Final NN state (`3D3`): `2S+1=3` -> `S=1`. `L=D` -> `L=2`. `J=3`.\n-   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*This reaction is permitted.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n-   Final NN state (`3P0`): `2S+1=3` -> `S=1`. `L=P` -> `L=1`. `J=0`.\n-   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S+L` must be odd for `T=0`.\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle constraint.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`3S1`): `2S+1=3` -> `S=1`. `L=S` -> `L=0`. `J=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*This reaction is permitted.*\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have found two \"not permitted\" reactions:\n-   **A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This is forbidden because the final `7D1` state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n-   **C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This is forbidden because it violates a selection rule derived from the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state.\n\nIn physics problems of this nature, you are typically expected to apply the given conservation laws and selection rules to the states as written. A violation of a selection rule (as in C) is a more direct answer to the question about a forbidden transition than a state that is likely a typo but otherwise satisfies the transition rules (as in A). The core of the question tests your ability to apply the rules of the process. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the selection rule check.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   **System:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN).\n*   **State:** 1S0. We use the term symbol notation (2S+1)L(J).\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` is the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `L_i = 0`, so the initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay process is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letters (s, p, f) denote its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. So, `s` means `l_X=0`, `p` means `l_X=1`, `f` means `l_X=3`. We assume particle X has no spin (`s_X=0`), as is common for particles like pions, which have `P=-1`.\n*   **Final NN State:** Has a given term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and a specified total isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for each proposed decay:\n\n**Condition 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is a formulation of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for nucleons, which requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric.\nGiven that the final state has `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**. Any final NN state with `T_f=0` that does not satisfy this condition is forbidden.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be the same before and after the decay.\n`P(initial) = P(final)`\n`P(NN, initial) = P(NN, final) * P(X) * P(relative)`\nThe parity of relative motion between NN(final) and X is `(-1)^l_X`.\n`(-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\nSince `L_i = 0`:\n`+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\n`-1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\nThis requires that the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**Condition 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be the same before and after the decay.\n`J_i = J_{total, f}`\n`J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n`J_{total, f} = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\nAssuming particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum (`j_X = l_X`).\nThe conservation law becomes `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\nFor `J_i=0`, the triangle inequality `|J_f - l_X| <= 0 <= J_f + l_X` can only be satisfied if `J_f = l_X`.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. A transition is not permitted if it fails any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is 3P0: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X is in an `s`-wave: `l_X=0`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. The condition requires this sum to be odd.\n    *   This transition is **forbidden** because the final NN state (3P0 with T=0) violates the Pauli principle.\n\nLet's check the other rules for completeness.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** We need `J_f = l_X`. Here, `0 = 0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** The process is forbidden due to the violation of the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   The term `7D1` implies `2S+1=7`, so `S=3`. This is impossible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only form total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. Assuming this is a typo and should be **3D1**.\n*   Final NN state is 3D1: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** We need `J_f = l_X`. Here, `1 = 1`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted (assuming 3D1).\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is 3S1: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** We need `J_f = l_X`. Here, `1 = 1`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state is 3D3: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X is in an `f`-wave: `l_X=3`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** We need `J_f = l_X`. Here, `3 = 3`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe only transition that violates the given physical laws is option A. It fails because the proposed final state for the two nucleons (`3P0` with `T=0`) is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial system is a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic S) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J(NN)_initial = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n*   `P(NN)_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n`NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X**: It has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum state is denoted by a lowercase letter (s, p, d, f...), which corresponds to `L(X) = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`. We assume X is a spin-0 particle, as is common in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Final NN state**: The problem states `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Rules\nA valid transition must satisfy several conditions:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    `J_initial = J_final`\n    `J(NN)_initial` is 0. The final angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum `J(NN)_final` and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum `L(X)`.\n    So, `vec(J(NN)_final) + vec(L(X)) = vec(J_initial) = 0`.\n    This vector equation implies that `vec(J(NN)_final)` and `vec(L(X))` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    Therefore, we must have `J(NN)_final = L(X)`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `P_initial = P(NN)_initial = +1`.\n    `P_final = P(NN)_final * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN)_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final)`\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^(L(X))`.\n    The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN)_final) * (-1) * (-1)^(L(X))`.\n    This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN)_final + L(X))`.\n    For this to be true, `(-1)^(L(NN)_final + L(X))` must be `-1`.\n    This means the exponent `L(NN)_final + L(X)` must be odd.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Principle for Final State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Since we are given `T(NN)_final = 0`, the equation becomes:\n    `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1` must be an even number.\n    Therefore, `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Fundamental Properties of the NN System**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). This means `2S+1` can only be 1 or 3. Also, for a given `L` and `S`, the total angular momentum `J` must be in the range `|L-S| <= J <= L+S`.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\nWe will check each option against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. `3 = 3`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=1` is OK. For `L=2, S=1`, `J` can be 1, 2, 3. `J=3` is valid. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1 = 7` means `S=3`. `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. `1 = 1`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system. **NOT PERMITTED**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because the final NN state is unphysical.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. `0 = 0`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S+L` be odd for `T=0`. **NOT PERMITTED**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=1` is OK. For `L=1, S=1`, `J` can be 0, 1, 2. `J=0` is valid. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition for a T=0 final state.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. `1 = 1`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=1` is OK. For `L=0, S=1`, `J` can only be 1. `J=1` is valid. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nBoth options B and C describe non-permitted transitions.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons. This violates a fundamental principle of particle composition.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the final state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) has `S+L = 2` (even). According to the Pauli principle rule provided (`T = S+L+1 mod 2`), such a state must have isospin `T=1`. The problem stipulates that the final NN state must have `T=0`, creating a direct contradiction.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, we should prioritize rules explicitly given in the problem statement. The problem provides the conservation laws and the specific Pauli/isospin relationship as the framework for the solution. Option C violates the Pauli/isospin rule explicitly. The issue with option B relies on a fundamental principle (composition of nucleons) not explicitly stated as a rule to check. Therefore, the most direct violation of the problem's premises is in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` means the orbital angular momentum spectroscopic symbol is S, which corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` means the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial state `NN(1S0)` decays into a final state `NN_f` and a particle `X`.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `L_X`.\n        *   `s` => `L_X = 0`\n        *   `p` => `L_X = 1`\n        *   `f` => `L_X = 3`\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n    *   Let the final NN state have quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Rules to Apply\n\nWe need to check each potential reaction against three rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_{final}`\n    *   `P_i = +1`\n    *   `P_{final} = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^L_X`, where `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f` and `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L_f + L_X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + L_X) = -1`.\n    *   **Rule 1: `L_f + L_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = J_{total_final}`\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`L_X`). (Assuming particle X is spinless).\n    *   `J_{total_final} = J_f + L_X`.\n    *   For the vector sum to be zero (`J_f + L_X = 0`), the magnitudes of the two vectors must be equal.\n    *   **Rule 2: `J_f = L_X`**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final State:** The problem explicitly gives a rule for the final NN state:\n    *   `T(NN)_f = S(NN)_f + L(NN)_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    *   Since `T(NN)_f = 0`, the rule becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\nNote on Rule 3: This rule is equivalent to the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, which states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, requiring `L+S+T` to be an odd number. For `T=0`, this means `L+S` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **Parity (`L_f + L_X` odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = L_X`?):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L_X=0`.\n1.  **Parity (`L_f + L_X` odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = L_X`?):** `0 = 0`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2`. This is even. **(VIOLATION)**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L_X=3`.\n1.  **Parity (`L_f + L_X` odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = L_X`?):** `3 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. So, a state with `S=3` is physically impossible. This reaction is fundamentally forbidden. However, let's test it against the given rules as a matter of process.\n1.  **Parity (`L_f + L_X` odd?):** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = L_X`?):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction satisfies all three rules given in the problem statement. It is only forbidden by the unstated, fundamental fact that two nucleons cannot form a spin `S=3` state.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth B and D represent forbidden reactions. However, reaction B is the only one that violates a rule explicitly provided and defined within the problem statement (the Pauli statistics requirement for the final T=0 state). Reaction D is forbidden for reasons external to the explicit rules given to check. In the context of a physics problem, you are expected to apply the given constraints. Therefore, B is the intended answer as it fails the explicit test.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` gives us:\n        *   Total spin `S_i`: `2S_i + 1 = 1` => `S_i = 0`.\n        *   Orbital angular momentum `L_i`: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n        *   Total angular momentum `J_i`: The number '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `l_X`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The system decays into a final NN state `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and particle X.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial` is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`).\n    *   The vector equation `J_f + l_X = J_i = 0` implies that the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final parities: `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** integer.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states a rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to the standard rule that `T+S+L` must be an odd integer for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the rule, we get `0 + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### 2. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition `1S0 -> (2S_f+1)L_f(J_f) + x` (where x has orbital angular momentum `l_X`) is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** `J_f = l_X`\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` is odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle (for T_f=0):** `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions. We decode the final NN term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and the particle's angular momentum state (e.g., s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `0 = 0`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(FAIL)**\nThis transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `0 + 1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. `S_f=3` is physically impossible. Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state cannot exist. However, let's check the transition rules as requested by the problem.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `2 + 1 = 3`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `3 + 2 = 5`. **(OK)**\nWhile this transition passes the specified conservation rules, it is forbidden because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and C represent forbidden transitions.\n*   Option A is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule for the final state, which was one of the specific rules the problem asked to use.\n*   Option C is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state (`7D1`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn the context of such physics problems, when asked to apply a specific set of rules, the intended answer is the one that violates one of those rules directly. Option A is the only choice that fails one of the three explicitly required checks (Angular Momentum, Parity, Pauli).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n- `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n- `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n- `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n- `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe problem also mentions the Pauli principle for two-nucleon states: `T + S + L` must be odd.\nFor the initial `1S0` state, `S_i=0` and `L_i=0`. For `T_i + 0 + 0` to be odd, the isospin of the initial state must be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Decay Process\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n- Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n- The final NN state is given to have isospin `T_f = 0`.\n- The lowercase letter `s, p, d, f` denotes the orbital angular momentum of the particle X relative to the final NN system. Let's call this `L_X`.\n    - `s`: `L_X = 0`\n    - `p`: `L_X = 1`\n    - `d`: `L_X = 2`\n    - `f`: `L_X = 3`\n- We assume the emitted particle X has no intrinsic spin (`s_X = 0`), which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. Its total angular momentum is therefore `j_X = L_X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Rules\nTo determine if a transition is permitted, we must check it against conservation laws and given selection rules.\n\n**Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n- `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) = vec(J_f_NN) + vec(j_X)`\n- Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f_NN) + vec(j_X) = 0`.\n- This implies the vectors must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, `J_f_NN = j_X`.\n- With our assumption `s_X = 0`, this becomes `J_f_NN = L_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n- `P_i = P_f = P_f_NN * P_X_intrinsic * P_X_orbital`\n- The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum `L` is `(-1)^L`.\n- `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n- `P_f_NN = (-1)^L_f_NN`.\n- `P_X_intrinsic = -1` (given).\n- `P_X_orbital = (-1)^L_X`.\n- So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X`.\n- `+1 = (-1)^(L_f_NN + L_X + 1)`.\n- This requires the exponent `L_f_NN + L_X + 1` to be an even number.\n- Therefore, `L_f_NN + L_X` must be an odd number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states a rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt is also given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n- Plugging `T_f = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f_NN + L_f_NN + 1 (mod 2)`.\n- This means `S_f_NN + L_f_NN + 1` must be an even number.\n- Therefore, `S_f_NN + L_f_NN` must be an odd number.\n\nA transition is not permitted if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against the three rules we've established.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n- Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n- Particle X state `f`: `L_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `3 = 3`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n- This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n- Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n- According to the three transition rules, this transition is **permitted**. (Note: A two-nucleon system cannot have S=3. This makes the final state physically impossible. However, the question asks to check the properties of the transition (partial wave), and the transition itself satisfies all the given rules. In such cases, one must focus on violations of the stated rules for the process.)\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n- Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n- This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n- Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n- Particle X state `s`: `L_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `0 = 0`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 1 = 2`. (✗)\n- The sum `S_f + L_f` is even, but the rule for a `T_f=0` final state requires it to be odd. This transition violates the Pauli statistics rule given in the problem.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe transition described in option D, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`, is the only one that violates the selection rules provided in the problem statement. Specifically, it violates the Pauli principle requirement for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `1S0` means:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1`  =>  Total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `S` (spectroscopic notation) => Orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `0` => Total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of the initial state is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`. For a two-nucleon system, the intrinsic parity `P_intrinsic = (+1) * (+1) = +1`. Thus, the initial parity is `P_initial = (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** According to the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`.\n    *   `0 + 0 + T(NN_initial)` must be odd, which implies `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J=0`, `P=+1`, `T=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given several properties of the final state:\n*   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN(final)` has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n*   Let the quantum numbers of the final NN state be `S(NN_final)`, `L(NN_final)`, and `J(NN_final)`.\n*   Let the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle `X` be `l_X`. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe must apply three rules to check if a transition is permitted:\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum `J(final) = J(NN_final) + l_X`.\n*   For `J(final)` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n*   `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n*   `P(initial) = +1`.\n*   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * (-1)^L(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   Substituting the known parities: `+1 = (+1) * (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   This simplifies to `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X) = -1`.\n*   Therefore, the sum `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an odd integer.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem explicitly gives the condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final state has `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T=0`: `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is an odd integer.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the proposed transitions against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it fails any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `1 = 1`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`.

Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   Conclusion: If we strictly follow the given rules, this transition is permitted. The issue lies in the physical existence of the final state, which is external to the selection rules being tested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, the transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates one of the explicit selection rules given in the problem (specifically, the Pauli statistics condition for the final T=0 state). Therefore, this is the partial wave that is not permitted.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_initial = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_initial = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum of the initial NN system is `J_initial = 0`.\n\nFrom these quantum numbers, we can determine the parity of the initial state:\n*   Parity is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n*   `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial `1S0` system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n*   **Final NN State**: Described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   **Particle X**: Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (`s`=0, `p`=1, `d`=2, `f`=3, etc.).\n\nWe must apply three main rules to check if a reaction is permitted:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`, the Pauli principle requires `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T(NN)_f = 0`, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This is true only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    `J_initial = J_final_total`\n    `J_initial` is the angular momentum of the initial NN state, which is `J_initial = 0`.\n    `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). (We assume particle X has no intrinsic spin, as is standard in such problems unless specified otherwise).\n    `J_final_total = J_f + l_X` (vector addition).\n    For the vector sum to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `|J_f - l_X| <= 0 <= J_f + l_X`, which implies `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `P_initial = +1`.\n    The final parity is the product of the parity of the final NN state, the intrinsic parity of particle X, and the parity from the orbital motion of particle X.\n    `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_X * P(orbital_X) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    So, the conservation equation is:\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed reaction against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n    *   **Rule 1 (Pauli)**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). ✔️\n    *   **Rule 2 (Ang.

The maximum possible spin is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`. Thus, the state `7D1` is not a possible NN state. Although it passes the formal checks below, its non-existence makes the transition forbidden.\n    *   **Rule 1 (Pauli)**: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). ✔️\n    *   **Rule 2 (Ang.

Option C is the only one that fails a direct check of the rules listed in the prompt (Pauli statistics, angular momentum, and parity conservation). The issue with option B is the composition of the state itself, a more fundamental fact but one that is external to the listed conservation laws to be checked. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that violates the specified reaction dynamics.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract its quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S=0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic S) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L=0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state (`NN'`) and a particle `X`.\n`1S0 -> NN' + X`\n\nThe final state consists of:\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN'`, denoted by `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n*   The emitted particle `X`, which has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` relative to the `NN'` center of mass. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**A. Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_initial = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_final` must also be 0.\n`J_final` is the vector sum of the `NN'` total angular momentum `J'` and the particle `X`'s total angular momentum `j_X`.\n`j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`. The problem does not specify the spin of particle X, so we can assume it's a pseudoscalar particle (like a pion) with `s_X = 0`.\nThus, `j_X = l_X`.\nThe conservation law is `J_initial = J_final`, so `vec{J_initial} = vec{J'} + vec{l_X}`.\nSince `J_initial = 0`, we have `0 = vec{J'} + vec{l_X}`, which implies `vec{J'} = -vec{l_X}`. For this to hold, their magnitudes must be equal:\n**Rule 1: `J' = l_X`**\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe initial parity is `P_initial = +1`. The final parity `P_final` must also be `+1`.\n`P_final = P(NN') * P(X) * P_orbital`\n*   `P(NN') = (-1)^L'`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n*   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the wavefunction for relative motion)\nSo, `P_final = (-1)^{L'} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`.\nFor parity to be conserved (`P_final = +1`), the exponent must be even:\n`L' + l_X + 1 = even`\nThis implies:\n**Rule 2: `L' + l_X = odd`**\n\n**C. Generalized Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\nFor any system of two identical fermions like nucleons (when treated in the isospin formalism), the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the requirement that the sum of their isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers must be odd:\n`T + S + L = odd`.\n\nThe problem specifies two conditions for the final `NN'` state:\n1.  The Pauli principle holds: `T' + S' + L' = odd`.\n2.  The isospin is `T' = 0`.\n\nSubstituting `T' = 0` into the Pauli rule gives:\n`0 + S' + L' = odd`.\n**Rule 3: `S' + L' = odd`**\n\n**D. Fundamental Constraint on Nucleon Spin:**\nA system of two nucleons (each spin-1/2) can only have a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). `2S+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n**Rule 4: `S'` must be 0 or 1.**\n\nAny permitted reaction must satisfy all these rules. We are looking for the one that is **not permitted**, meaning it violates at least one rule.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's test each option against the four rules derived above.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1` -> `2S'+1=7` means `S'=3`. `L'=D=2`. `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=3`. This is **impossible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state: `3D3` -> `S'=1`, `L'=2`, `J'=3`.\n*   Particle X: `f`-wave -> `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=3`, `l_X=3`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 2+3=5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+2=3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state: `3S1` -> `S'=1`, `L'=0`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=1`, `l_X=1`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 0+1=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state: `3P0` -> `S'=1`, `L'=1`, `J'=0`.\n*   Particle X: `s`-wave -> `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=0`, `l_X=0`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+1=2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S'+L'` must be odd for a `T'=0` state.\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition given the constraint `T'=0`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and D are not permitted.\n*   **Transition A** is impossible because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) is not a valid two-nucleon state. This is a violation of the fundamental rules of adding angular momentum.\n*   **Transition D** is impossible because it violates the selection rule derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for a `T=0` final state, as `S'+L'=2` is even. This can also be seen as a fundamental contradiction: a `3P0` state must have `T=1` to satisfy `T+S+L=odd` (`T+1+1=odd`), which contradicts the problem's premise that the final state has `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks which partial wave is not permitted. Usually, such questions test the application of selection rules on transitions between valid states. The violation in option D is a direct contradiction of the premises explicitly stated in the problem (`T(NN)=0` and the Pauli statistics rule). The violation in option A is due to the non-existence of the state itself, a fact that is fundamental but not explicitly listed in the rules to \"make use of\". Given that the properties of state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) are in direct conflict with the condition `T=0` via the Pauli principle, this represents the most direct violation of the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, we select D as the answer. It is forbidden by the explicit rules that the problem requires us to use.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n\nWe can also determine the parity of the initial state. The parity of an NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n*   Parity of the initial state: `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n`NN_i (1S0) -> NN_f + X`\n\n*   **Final NN state:** Described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The problem specifies that we should assume the isospin of this final state is `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f... corresponding to `l_X` = 0, 1, 2, 3...).\n\n### 3. Establish the Rules for Allowed Transitions\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and principles. The problem directs us to use:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`).\n    *   `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(l_X)`\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, this implies `vec(J_f) + vec(l_X) = 0`. This can only be true if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f(total)`\n    *   `P_f(total) = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^{l_X}`, where `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}` and `(-1)^{l_X}` is the parity of the relative motion between `NN_f` and `X`.\n    *   Substituting the known values: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1) * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`, which means `(-1)^{L_f + l_X}` must be `-1`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:** The problem explicitly provides the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are told to assume `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   So, `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n4.  **Fundamental Properties of the NN System:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 4.

Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and D are forbidden. However, transition A fails the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem statement for the assumed final state. Transition D fails a more fundamental property of the NN system (the maximum possible spin) that was not explicitly mentioned in the prompt. In the context of such problems, one is typically expected to find the violation of the explicitly stated rules. Transition A is the only one that violates the Pauli rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` for `T=0`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the System and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` -> Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` -> Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` -> Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The generalized Pauli principle states that for a two-nucleon system, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer, where T is the isospin. For the initial state, `L_i=0, S_i=0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies the initial isospin is `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **Process:** The initial NN system emits a particle X and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will assume particle X is spinless (spin `s_X = 0`), which is typical for such problems unless stated otherwise (e.g., a pion). The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f...`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n\n*   **Final State:** The final state consists of the `NN(final)` system and particle X.\n    *   The final NN state has a specified isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The properties of the final NN state are given by its term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   The particle X is in an orbital state `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three main rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum `J_f(NN)` and the angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`.\n    *   Assuming X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X`. So, `J_f` is the vector sum of `J_f(NN)` and `l_X`.\n    *   For `J_f` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the final NN system's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of X's orbital motion.\n    *   `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^(l_X)`.\n    *   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`. `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P_f = P_i = +1`. This means the exponent must be even: `L_f + l_X + 1 = even`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `L_f + l_X = odd`.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states that `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.\n    *   (This rule is a consequence of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, which requires `L+S+T` to be odd).\n\n4.  **State Validity:** The proposed final NN state `(2S+1)L(J)` must be physically possible for two nucleons. This means S can only be 0 or 1, and J must be a valid result of the vector addition of L and S.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these four conditions. A reaction is \"not permitted\" if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X in a `p` state: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n4.  **State Validity:** S=1 is possible. L=0, S=1 -> J=1 is possible. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X in an `s` state: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION.**\n4.  **State Validity:** S=1 is possible. L=1, S=1 -> J=0 is possible. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X in an `f` state: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n4.  **State Validity:** S=1 is possible. L=2, S=1 -> J=3 is possible. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X in a `p` state: `l_X=1`.\n4.  **State Validity:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). `S=3` is impossible. **VIOLATION.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because the proposed final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nWe have found two non-permitted reactions: B and D.\n*   Reaction B is forbidden because the final `NN` state (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the generalized Pauli principle, a rule explicitly highlighted in the question.\n*   Reaction D is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed `NN` state (`7D1`) cannot exist because two nucleons cannot form a spin S=3 state.\n\nIn the context of such physics problems, when one option (B) violates a dynamical rule you are explicitly asked to check (the Pauli rule relating L, S, and T), while another option (D) violates a compositional rule (how states are formed), the intended answer is typically the one that fails the specific analysis requested. Option B fails the parity rule `S_f + L_f = odd`. The other options, including D, formally satisfy all three conservation/Pauli rules if we hypothetically allow the `S=3` state to exist. Therefore, B is the most direct answer based on the problem's instructions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (`NN_initial`):** A two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since 2*0 + 1 = 1)\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter S)\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`\n    *   Parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the `NN` system is `l_X`. The notation `s, p, d, f` corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   We assume the intrinsic spin of particle X is `s_X = 0`, as is common unless stated otherwise. Its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n\n*   **Final State (`NN_final`):**\n    *   A two-nucleon system in a state described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   Parity of this state is `P_f = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   The problem states the isospin of this final state is `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**Conservation Laws & Principles:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    `J_i = J_final`\n    The initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the `NN_final` system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's angular momentum `j_X`.\n    `vec(J_final) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`.\n    For `J_final` to be 0, `vec(J_f)` and `vec(j_X)` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Thus, we need `J_f = j_X`. Assuming `s_X = 0`, this simplifies to `J_f = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `P_i = P_f * P_X * (-1)^l_X` (The final parity is the product of the final `NN` system's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity from the orbital motion of X).\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` is an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final `NN` state, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n    (This also implies that the final NN state must be physically possible for two nucleons, meaning `S_f` can only be 0 or 1).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Check:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). `S_f=3` is impossible.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because the final `NN` state is physically impossible.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (Satisfied)\n    2.  `L_f + l_X` = odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (Satisfied)\n    3.  `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (Satisfied)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (Satisfied)\n    2.  `L_f + l_X` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n    3.  `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **(VIOLATED)**. The sum is even.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final state.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n    2.  `L_f + l_X` = odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n    3.  `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nBoth options A and C describe forbidden reactions.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the final `NN` state `7D1` requires a total spin of S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option C is forbidden because, for the given final state `3P0` with `T_f=0`, it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\nThe question explicitly asks the solver to use the conservation laws and the provided Pauli statistics rule. Option C is the reaction that is forbidden by a direct application of this Pauli rule. Option A is forbidden for a more fundamental reason (the constituents of the system) that precedes the application of the specific reaction rules. In the context of such a physics problem, the intended answer is the one that directly tests the principles mentioned in the question.\n\nTherefore, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the forbidden partial wave based on the rules to be applied.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can decode `1S0`:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  =>  Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L = S`  =>  Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J = 0`  =>  Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Parity:** The parity of a two-particle system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n        *   `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Process:** The initial NN system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n    *   We assume particle X is a spin-0 meson (like a pion), which is standard for such problems unless specified otherwise. This means its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `j_X = l_X`.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Let the quantum numbers be `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`.\n    *   It is specified that the final state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe need to check each proposed reaction against a set of rules. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of these rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Principle (as given in the prompt)**\n    *   The prompt states: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P_final(NN) * P_orbital(X) * P_intrinsic(X)`.\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1)^(l_X) * (-1) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final)`\n    *   `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0` and we assume `j_X = l_X` (for a spin-0 particle X), we get `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `vec(J_f) = -vec(l_X)`, meaning their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Triangle Inequality for Angular Momentum**\n    *   The quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f` for the final NN state must be self-consistent. The total angular momentum `J_f` must be a possible result of vectorially adding `L_f` and `S_f`.\n    *   This means `|L_f - S_f| <= J_f <= L_f + S_f`.\n\n*   **Note on an additional potential rule:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). The `7D1` state in option A has `2S+1=7`, meaning `S=3`, which is physically impossible for two nucleons. While this renders option A impossible, option D violates a rule explicitly provided and constructed within the problem statement. In such cases, the intended answer is typically the one that fails the explicitly provided rules. We will see that D fails one of the main rules derived above.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against the four rules derived above.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|2 - 3| <= 1 <= 2 + 3`? Yes, `1 <= 1 <= 5`. **OK.**\n    *(This transition passes all checks derived from conservation laws and the provided Pauli rule, but is forbidden because S=3 is not possible for two nucleons.)*\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X is in an `f`-wave: `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|2 - 1| <= 3 <= 2 + 1`? Yes, `1 <= 3 <= 3`. **OK.**\n    *This transition is permitted.*\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|0 - 1| <= 1 <= 0 + 1`? Yes, `1 <= 1 <= 1`. **OK.**\n    *This transition is permitted.*\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X is in an `s`-wave: `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **FAILS** the requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f = 0`.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `0 = 0`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|1 - 1| <= 0 <= 1 + 1`? Yes, `0 <= 0 <= 2`. **OK.**\n    *This transition is forbidden because it violates the Pauli Principle constraint for a final state with `T_f=0`.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and D are forbidden for different reasons. Transition A is forbidden because a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin S=3. Transition D is forbidden because a `3P0` state must have isospin T=1 according to the generalized Pauli principle, which contradicts the problem's condition that `T_f = 0`. This contradiction manifests as a failure of Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\nSince option D violates a condition explicitly constructed from the rules given in the problem prompt (`T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 mod 2` and `T(NN)=0`), it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   Initial parity `P_i` depends on the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   A particle `X` with intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` is emitted.\n    *   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_x`.\n    *   s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n*   **Final State:** The final NN state `NN(final)` has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Rules (Conservation Laws and Statistics)**\n\nWe need to check three conditions for any potential reaction to be allowed.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_x`). For the initial and final total angular momenta to be equal:\n    `J_i = J_f + l_x` (vector sum)\n    `0 = J_f + l_x`\n    This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_x`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved. The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_x`\n    So, the conservation equation is: `P_i = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`.\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`\n    For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` must be an even number. This implies that the sum `L_f + l_x` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this into the rule:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Therefore, the sum of the final spin and final orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be **odd**.\n\n**3. Test Each Option Against the Rules**\n\nWe will check each option to see if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n    *This transition appears allowed by the rules of the decay process. However, the state `7D1` requires `S=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, making the transition forbidden.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`.

(VIOLATED)\n    *The sum `S_f + L_f` is even, which violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transition in option D) violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. Although the final state in option A) is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons, option D) is the one that fails the specific calculation based on the given constraints of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L_J`:\n*   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S', which corresponds to orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is 0, so the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nFrom these quantum numbers, we can determine the parity and isospin of the initial state.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum `L` is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts.\n    *   Antisymmetry `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1` which implies `L+S+T` must be odd.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which means the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Described by `(2S_f+1)L_f_{J_f}`. The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\nWe must apply the following rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum `J_i=0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `vec(J_f) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity `P_i=+1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^{L_f}`, the intrinsic parity of X `P(X)=-1`, and the orbital parity of X's motion `(-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `(-1)^{L_f+l_X+1} = +1`. This means `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even, or `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n    *   Given `T_f(NN)=0`, the rule simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n4.  **Validity of the Final State:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). This means `2S_f+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1`. This means `2S_f+1=7`, so `S_f=3`.\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(Violation)**\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state, which is a key selection rule mentioned explicitly in the problem.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, if a state is unphysical (like in A), it is often considered a typo. If we assume it was a typo for a valid state like `3D1`, the transition would be permitted (as `S=1, L=2, J=1; l_X=1` would satisfy all rules). The question prominently features the Pauli statistics requirement, suggesting that the test is focused on applying this specific rule. Option C is the only one that represents a transition to a physically possible state (`3P0` is valid) but is forbidden specifically by this Pauli principle selection rule. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract its quantum numbers. The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S=0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The spectroscopic notation 'S' corresponds to `L=0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J=0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The Pauli exclusion principle must apply to the two-nucleon system. The generalized Pauli principle states that the total wavefunction (spatial, spin, isospin) must be antisymmetric upon exchange of the two identical nucleons. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be odd, i.e., `L + S + T = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_initial = 1 (mod 2)`, which implies `T_initial = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `1S0`: `J=0, P=+1, T=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`\n\nWe are given several pieces of information and conservation laws must hold.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the final NN system is `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, ...).\n*   **Final NN state:** Has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic)`\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^(L_final) * (-1)^(l_X) * (-1)`\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies `L_final + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum vector is conserved.\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final)`\n    *   `vec(J(NN_initial)) = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`, where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, we have `0 = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   This implies `J(NN_final) = j_X` in magnitude.\n    *   The total angular momentum of particle X is `vec(j_X) = vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`, where `s_X` is the unknown spin of particle X. The magnitude `j_X` must satisfy the triangle inequality `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   A simple and common case in such problems is that X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which has `J^P=0-`). If `s_X=0`, then `j_X = l_X`, and the conservation law simplifies to `J(NN_final) = l_X`. We will use this simplified rule, as the result should be independent of the unknown spin `s_X`.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem gives a specific rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This can be rewritten as `S_final + L_final = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_final + L_final = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   So, for the final NN state, the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, `S_final + L_final`, must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Test Each Proposed Transition\n\nLet's check each option against the rules we've established:\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S + L` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule (for `s_X=0`):** `J = l_X`.\n4.  **State Possibility:** We should also note whether the proposed final NN state is physically possible (e.g., `S=0` or `1` for two nucleons).\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATED**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted due to violation of the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S=3`. `L=2` ('D' state). `J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). An `S=3` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted because the final state is impossible.\n*(Note: If we ignored this impossibility and just applied the selection rules, we would find: Pauli: `S+L = 3+2=5` (odd) -> OK. Parity: `L+l_X = 2+1=3` (odd) -> OK. Ang. Mom.: `J=1, l_X=1` -> OK. This is why it's important to recognize unphysical states.)*\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** violates the specific Pauli principle constraint given in the problem.\n*   **C)** involves a final state that is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this type, we are typically expected to find a unique answer by applying the principles mentioned in the problem statement. The question explicitly asks us to use \"Pauli statistics,\" \"conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\" Option B is the only one that fails the Pauli statistics rule as defined in the problem. The issue with option C is the impossibility of the state itself, which is a more fundamental error but might be considered outside the direct application of the specified conservation laws. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that violates the provided rules.\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because for the final NN state `3P0` (S=1, L=1) with T=0, the sum `S+L=2` is even, which violates the required condition that `S+L` must be odd.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe code execution has systematically evaluated each proposed reaction against the rules derived from the problem statement. Let's summarize the findings to select the final answer.\n\n### Summary of Rules\nA reaction `1S0 -> NN_f + X` is permitted only if all three conditions are met:\n1.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.\n2.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the final nucleon pair, `J_f`, must equal the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n3.  **Pauli Constraint (for T_f=0):** The sum of the final nucleon pair's spin and orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be an odd number.\n\n### Analysis of Each Option based on Code Output\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** The code shows that this reaction passes all three rules given in the problem. However, the `7D1` state implies a total spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system, which is physically impossible as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form `S=0` or `S=1`. So, while it passes the given checklist, it's forbidden on more fundamental grounds.\n*   **B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and describes a physically possible final state. It is a permitted transition.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** The code shows that this reaction violates **Rule 3**, the Pauli statistics constraint.\n    *   For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`.\n    *   The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an **even** number.\n    *   This violates the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd** for a final state with `T(NN)=0`.\n    *   Therefore, this partial wave is **not permitted**.\n*   **D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and is physically possible. It is a permitted transition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the partial wave that is **not permitted**. Option C is the only one that violates one of the explicit rules provided in the problem statement (the Pauli constraint). While option A is also forbidden, it's due to a reason outside the specified rules, making option C the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` tells us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` means the initial orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` means the total initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Process:** The system emits a particle X, leading to a final state.\n    *   `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum `L(X)` is given by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Conservation Laws and Principles\nThe problem requires us to use three key principles:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = J_f_total}`.\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f_total}` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   So, `vec(J_f) + vec(j_X) = 0`. This implies their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X, `S(X)`. A standard assumption for emitted mesons (like pions) or in such problems when not specified is `S(X)=0`. If `S(X)=0`, then `j_X = L(X)`.\n*   Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum rule is: **`J_f = L(X)`**.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   The parity of a composite system is the product of the intrinsic parities of its components multiplied by `(-1)^L`, where L is the relative orbital angular momentum.\n*   **Initial Parity:** `P_i = P(NN_i) = P_n * P_p * (-1)^{L_i}`. Nucleons (protons 'p', neutrons 'n') have intrinsic parity `+1`. `L_i=0`. So, `P_i = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Final Parity:** `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^{L(X)}`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_f} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L(X)} = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`.\n*   Conservation (`P_i = P_f`) means `+1 = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`. This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + L(X)} = -1`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be odd. So, the rule is: **`L_f + L(X)` must be odd**.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for Nucleons:**\n*   The problem states: \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\".\n*   This is equivalent to the fundamental requirement that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric, which means `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n*   The problem then asks us to evaluate the options under the specific condition: **`T_f = 0`**.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the Pauli rule `L_f+S_f+T_f` = odd, we get `L_f+S_f` = odd.\n*   So, for a transition to be allowed under the given condition, the final NN state must satisfy: **`L_f + S_f` must be odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe will now check each of the four options against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7 -> S_f=3`; `L_f=2` (D-wave); `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **State Validity:** Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin can only be `S = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet). A state with `S_f = 3` (a septet) is impossible for a two-nucleon system. The state `7D1` does not exist for an NN system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `2S_f+1=3 -> S_f=1`; `L_f=1` (P-wave); `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. Is this odd? No, it is even. (VIOLATION)\n*   Since this option violates the Pauli principle for `T_f=0`, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`; `L_f=0`; `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 0 + 1 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`; `L_f=2`; `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 2 + 1 = 3`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two forbidden transitions:\n*   **A) is forbidden** because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **B) is forbidden** because it violates the selection rule imposed by the Pauli principle under the problem's condition that `T_f = 0`. The `3P0` state requires `T_f=1`.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must identify the single best answer. The question's structure explicitly provides the Pauli principle rule and asks to evaluate the options assuming `T_f = 0`. This directs the solver to test this specific condition. Option B is the only one that fails this test. The impossibility of state A is due to prior knowledge outside the specific rules laid out in the problem text for the test. The most direct contradiction of the problem's setup is found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies `S(NN)_initial = 0` (total spin).\n*   The letter `S` denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum, `J(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^(L(NN)_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons (identical fermions) requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where T is the total isospin. For the initial state: `(-1)^(0+0+T) = -1`, which means `T(NN)_initial = 1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Final State**\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the final NN system is denoted by `l_X` (`s`=0, `p`=1, `d`=2, `f`=3, etc.).\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n\n**3. Establish the Conservation Laws and Constraints**\n\nWe need to check each option against a set of rules. A reaction is permitted only if it satisfies all of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum.**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J(NN)_final`) and the relative orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved (`J_final = 0`), the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN)_final = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity.**\n    The initial parity is `P_initial = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of the relative motion: `P_final = P(NN)_final * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    `P(NN)_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final)`.\n    So, `P_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_initial = P_final`), we need `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X)`.\n    This implies `(-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X) = -1`, which means `L(NN)_final + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State.**\n    The problem states that for `T(NN)_final = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T(NN)_final = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1` must be an even number, which in turn means `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Angular Momentum Coupling.**\n    For any state, the total angular momentum `J` must satisfy the triangle inequality with the orbital angular momentum `L` and spin `S`: `|L - S| <= J <= L + S`.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's check each proposed reaction against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `3 + 2 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   Check 4 (|L-S|<=J<=L+S): `|2-3| <= 1 <= 2+3` => `1 <= 1 <= 5`. (Pass)\n*   *Note*: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) cannot have a total spin S=3. The only possibilities are S=0 or S=1. So this state is physically impossible. However, it passes the explicit rules given for the *reaction dynamics*.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Check 4 (|L-S|<=J<=L+S): `|2-1| <= 3 <= 2+1` => `1 <= 3 <= 3`. (Pass)\nThis reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `1 + 1 = 2`. This is even. **(FAIL)**\n*   This reaction violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state as given in the problem.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 4 (|L-S|<=J<=L+S): `|0-1| <= 1 <= 0+1` => `1 <= 1 <= 1`. (Pass)\nThis reaction is permitted.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction in option C is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon state (`S+L` must be odd for T=0, but here S+L=2 is even). This is a direct violation of one of the rules specified in the problem statement. While option A leads to a physically impossible state (`S=3`), it passes all the conservation and symmetry rules given to test the reaction dynamics. Therefore, C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   **State:** The initial two-nucleon (NN) system is in a `1S0` state.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   Initial parity `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number (like 0, 2, 4...).\n    *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is a crucial test for the final NN state.\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n    *   `vec(J_final_total) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`. For this sum to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal, `J_f = j_X`, and their vectors must be opposite.\n    *   Particle X has orbital angular momentum `l_X` (given by s, p, d, f...). The problem does not state its spin (`s_X`). In such problems, it is standard to assume the emitted particle is spinless (e.g., a pion), so `s_X = 0`.\n    *   If `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l_X`. The condition simplifies to `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final_total`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_final_total = P_{NN,f} * P_X`.\n    *   `P_{NN,f} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   The parity of particle X is `P_X = (P_intrinsic_X) * (-1)^{l_X}`. We are given that the intrinsic parity of X is -1.\n    *   `P_X = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{l_X + 1}`.\n    *   So, `P_final_total = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   The conservation law `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}` requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against these three rules:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet).\n*   A total spin of `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system. The final state `7D1` is unphysical.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state cannot exist.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the Pauli principle requirement** for a final state with T=0.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two non-permitted transitions: B and D.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final NN state (`7D1`) is fundamentally impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option D is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem for a final NN state with `T=0`. The state `3P0` itself is possible for two nucleons, but it must have `T=1` to satisfy the Pauli principle (`L+S+T=1+1+1=3` odd), not `T=0` as required by the problem.\n\nThe question explicitly asks the solver to use the Pauli statistics requirement. Option D fails this specific test. Option B fails on a more basic state-composition ground. In physics problems of this nature, one should prioritize the rules explicitly given. The transition in D satisfies conservation laws but fails the additional constraint imposed by the Pauli principle, which is what the question appears designed to test.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine the quantum numbers of the initial state:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  =>  `S_i = 0` (Total spin).\n        *   The letter `S` corresponds to `L_i = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum).\n        *   The subscript `0` means `J_i = 0` (Total angular momentum).\n    *   **Initial Parity:** The parity of the NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X, leading to a final state of the NN system plus particle X.\n    *   Reaction: `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   **Particle X:**\n        *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` (given).\n        *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum, `l`, of the emitted particle X relative to the final NN system.\n            *   s: `l=0`\n            *   p: `l=1`\n            *   f: `l=3`\n    *   **Final NN State:**\n        *   This is given by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n        *   It is explicitly stated that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation Laws and Physical Principles\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three main rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   `J_initial = J_final` (vector sum).\n    *   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the total angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X is a spin-0 particle like a pion (which has intrinsic parity -1), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l`.\n    *   So, `J_final = J_f + l` (vector sum).\n    *   For `J_initial = 0`, we must have `J_f + l = 0`. This is only possible if the vectors have equal magnitude and opposite direction. Thus, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = P(NN_i) = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^l`.\n    *   Setting `P_initial = P_final`:\n        `+1 = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^l`\n        `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l)`\n        `-1 = (-1)^(L_f + l)`\n    *   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l` is an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Generalized Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    *   For a system of two identical fermions like nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   The problem states this in an equivalent form: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has `T_f(NN) = 0`. Plugging this into the rule:\n        `L_f + S_f + T_f = L_f + S_f + 0` must be odd.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + S_f` must be an **odd** number for the final NN state.\n\n### 3.

Understand the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_initial = 0`. This is the singlet state.\n*   `L = S` means the orbital angular momentum is `L_initial = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` means the total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe need to check each proposed transition against several rules for it to be permitted.\n\n**Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n*   `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The final state consists of the NN system and particle X. The total final angular momentum `J_final(total)` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_final`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   So, `J_final` and `j_X` must be able to couple to `J_initial = 0`. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_final = j_X`.\n*   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the *orbital* angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). If we assume particle X has no intrinsic spin (`s_X=0`), then `j_X = l_X`.\n*   Thus, the conservation of angular momentum requires `J_final = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the system must be conserved.\n*   `P_initial = +1`.\n*   The final parity `P_final` is the product of the parities of the final NN state, particle X, and their relative orbital motion.\n*   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final`.\n*   The problem states particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_final + l_X)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved, `P_initial = P_final`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L_final + l_X)`.\n*   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_final + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_final + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Principle**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, the isospin `T`, spin `S`, and orbital angular momentum `L` must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given the condition that the final state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, the sum `S_final + L_final` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**Rule 4: Angular Momentum Coupling**\nFor the final NN state, described by `(2S_final+1)L_final(J_final)`, the quantum numbers must satisfy the triangle inequality for vector addition: `|L_final - S_final| <= J_final <= L_final + S_final`.\n\nA transition is **not permitted** if it violates any of these four rules.\n\n### 3.

In the context of this type of problem, we identify the option that fails the explicit rules we are asked to apply.*\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTransition C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is the only one that violates one of the explicit principles we must check (the Pauli principle). The condition `S_final + L_final` must be odd is not met, as `1+1=2` is even.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which transition is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Understand the System and the Rules\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The NN system emits a particle `X`.\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity of -1.\n    *   Let the orbital angular momentum of X be `l_X`. The spectroscopic notation is `s` for `l_X=0`, `p` for `l_X=1`, `d` for `l_X=2`, `f` for `l_X=3`.\n    *   The total parity of the emitted particle `X` is its intrinsic parity times its orbital parity: `P_X = (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(l_X + 1)`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A new NN state plus particle X.\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Let the final NN state have quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`.\n    *   The parity of the final NN state is `P_f = (-1)^L_f`.\n\n*   **Governing Rules:**\n    1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle (as given):** For the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T_f = 0`, the rule becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** `P_i = P_f * P_X`.\n        *   `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1)^(l_X + 1)`\n        *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n        *   This implies `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n    3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n        *   `J_i = J_f + j_X = 0` (vector sum).\n        *   This requires their magnitudes to be equal, `J_f = j_X`.\n        *   Particle X's total angular momentum `j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its spin `s_X`. We don't know `s_X`, but a common particle emitted in such interactions is a pion, which has `s_X=0`. Let's assume `s_X=0`. This simplifies the condition to `J_f = l_X`. We will see this assumption is not critical.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against our three conditions:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X` (assuming `s_X=0`).\n\n---\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n---\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **NOT OK**. This violates the given Pauli principle condition.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state.*\n\n---\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. A `7D1` state implies `2S+1=7`, so `S=3`, which is not possible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, the final state is unphysical, making the transition forbidden.\n*   However, let's assume the state exists for the sake of argument and check the transition rules.\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: The transition itself satisfies all conservation laws and the given Pauli rule. The issue is the existence of the final state, which requires external knowledge. Option B violates a rule explicitly provided in the problem statement.*\n\n---\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nAmong the four options, option **B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`** is the only one that violates the selection rules given in the problem statement (specifically, the Pauli principle condition for the final T=0 NN state). While option C describes an unphysical state, option B describes a process that is dynamically forbidden by a specified rule. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and an emitted particle `X`.\nThe reaction is: `1S0 -> NN_f + X`\n\nWe must apply three main principles:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:** The problem provides a condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is our first condition.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_initial = +1` (as calculated above).\n    *   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity of their relative motion. `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f` (where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state).\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given in the problem for particle X).\n    *   `P_orbital = (-1)^L_X` (where `L_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X relative to the NN system, denoted by `s, p, d, f...`).\n    *   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^(L_f + L_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + L_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_f + L_X + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** number. This is our second condition.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final_system)`\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final system's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n    *   `vec(J_final_system) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   So, `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`, which means `vec(J_f) = -vec(j_X)`.\n    *   This requires their magnitudes to be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n    *   The particle X's total angular momentum `j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `L_X` and its spin `S_X`. So, by the triangle inequality, `|L_X - S_X| <= j_X <= L_X + S_X`.\n    *   Thus, the condition is `|L_X - S_X| <= J_f <= L_X + S_X`. This must be possible for some valid spin `S_X`. This is our third condition.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against these three conditions.\nThe final NN state is given by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The particle X state is `L_X` (`s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3`).\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S_f + L_f` is odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check (`L_f + L_X` is odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Check (`J_f=j_X` possible?):** `J_f = 1`. We need `j_X = 1`. From `L_X=1`, this is possible (e.g., if `S_X=0`, `j_X=1`; if `S_X=1`, `j_X` can be 0, 1, 2). -> **OK**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n*   The state `7D1` implies `2S_f + 1 = 7`, which means `S_f = 3`. This is not a possible spin state for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible, and the transition is not permitted for this fundamental reason. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we should also check if any other option violates the specific rules provided in the prompt. Let's proceed to check the others.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S_f + L_f` is odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check (`L_f + L_X` is odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Check (`J_f=j_X` possible?):** `J_f = 3`. We need `j_X = 3`. From `L_X=3`, this is possible (e.g., if `S_X=0`, `j_X=3`; if `S_X=1`, `j_X` can be 2, 3, 4). -> **OK**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S_f + L_f` is odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2`. (Even) -> **VIOLATION**\n2.  **Parity Check (`L_f + L_X` is odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Check (`J_f=j_X` possible?):** `J_f = 0`. We need `j_X = 0`. From `L_X=0`, this requires `j_X = S_X`. So, `S_X` must be 0. This is possible. -> **OK**\n*   This transition violates the Pauli statistics condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd). Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics selection rule that was explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, you are expected to apply the rules given in the prompt. Option D is the only one that violates these explicitly mentioned transition rules. The impossibility of state B is based on the rules of angular momentum composition, which is prerequisite knowledge but not one of the \"rules of the game\" set out for this specific problem (parity, angular momentum conservation, and the specific Pauli rule). Thus, D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` tells us:\n        *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies total spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   The letter `S` implies orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   The subscript `0` implies total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity of the initial state:** `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   **Isospin of the initial state:** The generalized Pauli principle for two identical nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. The condition is `L+S+T` must be odd. For the initial state, `L_i+S_i+T_i = 0+0+T_i` must be odd, which implies the isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The NN system emits a particle X. The reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Conditions for the Final State\n\nWe must check each potential transition against three main conditions:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem states a rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f=0` into the rule gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd number**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the vector sum of the total angular momenta of the final products.\n    *   `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`\n    *   We know `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`, is the sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`. Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (common in such problems unless specified otherwise), `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   The conservation law becomes `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(l_X)`. This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`\n    *   `P(NN_f)` is the parity of the final nucleon pair, which is `(-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P(X)` is the intrinsic parity of particle X, given as `-1`.\n    *   `P_orbital` is the parity from the relative motion of `NN_f` and `X`, which is `(-1)^l_X`.\n    *   Putting it all together: `P_i = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `P_i = +1`, we have `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    *   This requires `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each of the given transitions against our three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   **Final NN State:** `7D1`. This implies `2S_f+1 = 7`, which means `S_f = 3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3P0`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   **Particle X (`s`-wave):** `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. This violates the Pauli statistics condition for a `T_f=0` final state.\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (Condition satisfied).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Condition satisfied).\n*   The transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3S1`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   **Particle X (`p`-wave):** `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK).\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK).\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3D3`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   **Particle X (`f`-wave):** `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK).\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK).\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and B are not permitted.\n*   Transition A is impossible because the final state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Transition B is impossible because the combination of the final state `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1`) and the condition `T_f=0` violates the Pauli principle as stated in the problem (`S_f+L_f` must be odd).\n\nIn a multiple-choice context, there is likely a single intended answer. The question explicitly provides the Pauli statistics rule to be used. Option B fails this specific rule directly. The issue with option A is more of a fundamental state definition problem, and it's plausible the `7D1` term is a typo for a valid state like `3D1` (which would make transition A permitted). Therefore, the most likely intended answer is B, as its violation is directly tied to the rules provided in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The spectroscopic symbol `S` means `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The value `0` means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe process is the emission of a particle X, so the reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\nThe final state consists of the final two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and the emitted particle `X`.\n\nWe need to check three constraints for a transition to be \"permitted\":\n*   Conservation of Angular Momentum\n*   Conservation of Parity\n*   Pauli Principle for the final NN state\n\nLet's formalize these constraints.\n\n**Constraint 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_initial = J_final`.\n`J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`).\n`\\vec{J}_{final} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{J_X}`.\nThe particle X is specified by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which denotes its orbital angular momentum `L(X)` relative to the NN system. The problem gives no information about the spin of particle X (`S(X)`). For simple particle emissions like pseudoscalar mesons (e.g., pions, which have intrinsic parity -1), the spin is zero. We will assume `S(X) = 0`.\nTherefore, `J_X = L(X)`.\nThe conservation law `\\vec{J_i} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{L(X)}` becomes `\\vec{0} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{L(X)}`. This vector equation can only be satisfied if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = L(X)`.\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved. `P_initial = P_final`.\n`P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X)`.\n`P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\nThe parity of particle `X` has two parts: its intrinsic parity (`P_intrinsic(X) = -1`, given) and its orbital parity (`P_orbital(X) = (-1)^{L(X)}`).\nSo, `P_final = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L(X)} = (-1)^{L_f + L(X) + 1}`.\nThe conservation law `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + L(X) + 1}` requires the exponent `L_f + L(X) + 1` to be an even number. This is equivalent to `L_f + L(X)` being an **odd** number.\n\n**Constraint 3: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt also specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\nSubstituting `T_f = 0` into the formula:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. This is equivalent to `S_f + L_f` being an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe now check each of the four proposed transitions against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J conservation):** `J_f = 3`, `L(X) = 3`.

However, we will test it against the given rules first.\n*   **Rule 1 (J conservation):** `J_f = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. This satisfies `J_f = L(X)`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity conservation):** `L_f + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli principle):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Conclusion: According to the three specific rules derived from the prompt, this transition is permitted. The issue lies in the physical impossibility of the state `7D1` itself, which is information external to the provided transition rules.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J conservation):** `J_f = 1`, `L(X) = 1`.

This satisfies `J_f = L(X)`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity conservation):** `L_f + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli principle):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd. **(FAIL)**\n*   Conclusion: Not Permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates one of the explicit rules given in the problem statement (specifically, the Pauli principle constraint for the final state). While the final state in option B is physically impossible for two nucleons, the transition itself does not violate any of the selection rules laid out in the problem. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it is forbidden by the specified rules of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the not-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Rules\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `1S0` -> `2S+1=1` so `S(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` means the orbital angular momentum `L(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The parity of a state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The generalized Pauli principle for two nucleons (identical fermions) requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, which implies that the sum of their orbital angular momentum, spin, and isospin quantum numbers `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0, S=0`. So, `0+0+T` must be odd, which means the isospin of the initial state `T(initial) = 1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle `X` and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted with a relative orbital angular momentum `l` (where `s` denotes `l=0`, `p` denotes `l=1`, etc.).\n    *   The final NN state has `T(NN_final) = 0` (given in the problem).\n\n*   **Conservation Laws and Selection Rules:**\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. `J(initial) = J(final)`. Assuming particle X has no intrinsic spin (`S(X)=0`), the final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l`).\n        `vec(J(initial)) = vec(J_f) + vec(l)`\n        Since `J(initial) = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f) + vec(l) = 0`, which implies their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l`.\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the system must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n        `P(initial) = +1`.\n        `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^l`.\n        So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l + 1)`.\n        This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l + 1` is an even number. This implies that `L_f + l` must be an odd number.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final State:** The question provides the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is a restatement of the generalized Pauli principle (`L+S+T` must be odd). We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`. Plugging this into the rule:\n        `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  `J_f = l`\n2.  `L_f + l` is odd\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd\n\n---\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): The notation implies `2S+1=7`, which means `S=3`. This is impossible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Thus, the final state itself is not a valid two-nucleon state, and the transition is forbidden. This is a possible answer, but it's often the case in such problems that an obvious impossibility like this is a typo. Let's assume it's a typo for `3D1` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=1`) and check the rules to see if another option is forbidden. With this assumption:\n    *   Particle X (`p`): `l=1`.\n    *   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `1 = 1`. (OK)\n    *   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n    *   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n    *   If it's a typo for `3D1`, the transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l=1`.\n*   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted by all rules.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l=3`.\n*   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted by all rules.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l=0`.\n*   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 1 = 2`. This is an even number. **(Violation)**\n*   This transition violates the Pauli principle for the final state (`T_f=0` requires `S_f+L_f` to be odd). Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and D describe forbidden transitions. However, option A is forbidden because the state `7D1` cannot physically exist for a two-nucleon system. Option D describes a transition between physically plausible states (the term `3P0` is valid in spectroscopy) that is forbidden by a selection rule derived directly from the information given in the problem (the Pauli rule and `T_f=0`). In the context of such physics problems, the intended answer is typically the one that violates the explicitly mentioned conservation laws or selection rules. The issue in A is more likely a typo, which, if corrected to the most plausible alternative (`3D1`), would make the transition valid. This leaves D as the unique answer that violates the specific rules we are asked to apply.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol is given by `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** `L` is denoted by 'S' => `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J` is given as '0' => `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a system is determined by its orbital angular momentum: `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical fermions (nucleons) requires the total wavefunction `Ψ = ψ(space)ψ(spin)ψ(isospin)` to be antisymmetric.\n    *   The symmetry of the spatial part `ψ(space)` is `(-1)^L`. For `L_i=0`, it's symmetric (+1).\n    *   The symmetry of the spin part `ψ(spin)` is `(-1)^(S+1)`. For `S_i=0`, it's `(-1)^(0+1) = -1` (antisymmetric).\n    *   For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, `(+1) * (-1) * ψ(isospin)` must be -1. This means `ψ(isospin)` must be symmetric, which corresponds to an isospin `T_i = 1`.\n    *   (Alternatively, the problem provides a rule `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`. For the initial state `S_i=0, L_i=0`, this would imply `T_i = 0 + 0 + 1 (mod 2) = 1`, which confirms our finding.)\n\nSo, the initial state is `(S_i, L_i, J_i, T_i, P_i) = (0, 0, 0, 1, +1)`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must check each proposed final state against three rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem states `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    For the final state, we are given `T(NN, final) = 0`.\n    Plugging this in gives: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. This is equivalent to stating that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN, final) * P(X, intrinsic) * P(X, orbital)`.\n    *   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   `P(X, intrinsic) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(X, orbital) = (-1)^{L_X}`, where `L_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n    The conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L_X}`.\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + L_X}`.\n    `(-1)^{L_f + L_X} = -1`.\n    This means the exponent `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`). The simplest case, and the one implied by the notation, is to consider the vector sum of `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of X, `L_X`. For the total final angular momentum to be zero, these two vectors must be able to cancel each other out. This requires that they have equal magnitude, i.e., `J_f = L_X`.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the proposed transitions against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p` (p-wave): `L_X=1`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd).  **OK.**\n    2.  **Parity:** `L_f + L_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n    3.  **Ang.

Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `L_X = 1`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\nThe only transition that violates one of the fundamental rules is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` for L corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The number `0` for J is the total angular momentum of the initial system, `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial two-nucleon system is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Pauli Principle for the initial state**: The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical fermions (nucleons) states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where `T` is the total isospin. For the initial state `1S0`, we have `L_i = 0` and `S_i = 0`. Therefore, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies that the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Decay Process\n\nThe initial NN system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n`NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n\n*   **Particle X**:\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `d`, `f`), corresponding to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`, respectively.\n    *   We will assume the intrinsic spin of particle X is `s_X = 0`, as is common in such problems unless specified otherwise. This means its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n\n*   **Final NN State**:\n    *   Its quantum numbers are given by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   The problem specifies that the isospin of the final NN state is `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 3. Establish the Conservation Laws and Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and principles.\n\n1.  **Pauli Principle (Final State)**: The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. With the given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which means `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation**: The total parity of the final state must equal the total parity of the initial state.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    *   For `P(initial) = P(final)`, we need `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`.\n    *   This implies that the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = 0`\n    *   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming `s_X=0`).\n    *   So, `J_i = J_f (vector sum) l_X`.\n    *   `0 = J_f (vector sum) l_X`\n    *   This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, so `J_f = l_X`.\n\n4.  **Constituent Constraint**: The final NN state must be physically possible for two nucleons. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions, their total spin `S_f` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the four proposed transitions against these four rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=1`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=3`. This is **impossible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Conclusion: **Not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f=0`.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=1`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: **Not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=1`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the final state (`7D1`) is impossible for two nucleons (`S` cannot be 3). This is a fundamental violation based on the system's constituents.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because, for the given condition `T_f=0`, the final state `3P0` violates the generalized Pauli principle (`S_f+L_f` is even, not odd). This is a direct violation of a rule explicitly stated in the problem.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, when asked to use specific rules (like Pauli statistics here), the intended answer is usually the one that violates those explicit rules. The violation in option C is precisely an application of the Pauli statistics rule provided. The issue in option B is that the state itself is ill-defined for the system, which could be seen as a badly formed question or a very strong \"not permitted\" case. However, the most direct application of the provided rules points to C as the forbidden transition.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a **1S0** state.\nFrom the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can extract the quantum numbers:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the total orbital angular momentum is `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and the Reaction\nThe process is the emission of a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   It is emitted in a partial wave denoted by a lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`), which corresponds to its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n        *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n    *   No spin is mentioned for X, so we assume its spin is `s_X = 0`.\n*   **Final NN state:**\n    *   The problem specifies that the isospin of the final NN state is `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Governing Laws and Rules\nThe problem asks us to use three specific constraints to determine which transition is forbidden:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem provides the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    *   `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    *   `P(initial) = +1` (from step 1).\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)` where `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For this to be true, the exponent `L(NN_final) + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum vector must be conserved.\n    *   `J(initial) = J(final)` (vector sum).\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J(final) = J(NN_final) + J(X)`. Assuming `s_X=0`, `J(X)` is just `l_X`.\n    *   So, the vector sum `J(NN_final) + l_X = 0`.\n    *   This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J(NN_final) = l_X`.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\nNow we apply these three rules to each of the proposed transitions. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is `3P0`: `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Emitted particle X is `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Check the rules:\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S+L` must be odd for T=0.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `3S1`: `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Emitted particle X is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Check the rules:\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `7D1`: `2S+1=7 => S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (each spin-1/2) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. S=3 is physically impossible. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed.\n*   Let's check the given rules anyway, as instructed by the problem format:\n*   Emitted particle X is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. However, it does not violate the three specific rules the problem asks us to check.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state is `3D3`: `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Emitted particle X is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Check the rules:\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" transitions:\n*   **A)** is forbidden by the explicit Pauli rule given in the prompt.\n*   **C)** is forbidden by the fundamental principle that two nucleons cannot have a total spin of S=3.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the Pauli statistics rule. Option A is the only one that fails this specific set of checks. Option C fails on a more fundamental, but unstated, premise. In the context of such problems, one should prioritize the rules explicitly given. Therefore, option A is the intended answer as it's the one that is invalidated by the provided criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial two-nucleon system is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe initial system decays into a final two-nucleon state (`NN_f`) and a particle `X`.\n`NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n\nThe properties of the final state are:\n*   Final NN state: Quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`. Its parity is `P_f = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n*   Particle X: Intrinsic parity `P_X_intrinsic = -1`. Orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3...).\n\nWe must apply three main rules: Pauli Statistics (as given), Parity Conservation, and Angular Momentum Conservation.\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt is also given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting `T_f = 0` into the rule:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Consequently, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Condition 1: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the system must be conserved.\n`P_initial = P_final`\n`P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic)`\n`(+1) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)`\nMultiplying both sides by -1:\n`-1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\nThis implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Condition 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n**Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_{final_total}`\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n`\\vec{J}_{final_total} = \\vec{J}_f + \\vec{j}_X`\nSo, `0 = \\vec{J}_f + \\vec{j}_X}`, which means `J_f = j_X`.\nThe particle X has orbital angular momentum `l_X` and intrinsic spin `s_X`. Its total angular momentum `j_X` can take values `|l_X - s_X|, ..., l_X + s_X`. The spin `s_X` is unknown, but a valid transition requires that there exists *some* possible value of `s_X` that satisfies `J_f = j_X`. A simple case is to check if the condition holds for a spinless particle (`s_X=0`), where `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Condition 3: It must be possible that `J_f = j_X` (where `j_X` depends on `l_X` and `s_X`).**\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. The option that violates any of these conditions is not permitted.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` -> `S_f=3`. `L=D` -> `L_f=2`. `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\nA two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. The maximum possible total spin is `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1`. A state with `S_f = 3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is forbidden.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. If X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X = 1`. So `J_f=j_X` holds. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. If X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X = 3`. So `J_f=j_X` holds. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This violates Condition 1, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be odd.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. Requires `j_X = 0`. Since `j_X = |l_X-s_X| ... |l_X+s_X|`, with `l_X=0`, we have `j_X=s_X`. So this would require `s_X=0`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Not Permitted due to violation of the Pauli statistics rule.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   D is forbidden because the final NN state configuration (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the given Pauli statistics requirement (`S_f+L_f` must be odd).\n\nBoth A and D describe an impossible process. However, the question provides an explicit and somewhat complex rule regarding Pauli statistics (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`) and instructs to \"Make use of\" the conservation laws. This strongly suggests that the intended forbidden answer is the one that violates these specific rules of the decay process. Option D is the only one that fails this test. The impossible spin in option A can be seen as either a typo in the problem or a \"distractor\" that relies on knowledge outside the immediate decay-rule framework presented. Following the logic prescribed by the problem leads directly to D being forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial state is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` is the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial NN state is given by `P_i(NN) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\nSince the system consists only of these two nucleons, the total parity of the initial state is `P_i_total = +1`.\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_i_total = J_i = 0`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply several conservation laws and constraints.\n\n**a) Isospin (T)**\nThe problem gives a specific formula for Pauli statistics, which depends on isospin. Let's determine the isospin of the initial state. The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, which leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\nFor the initial `1S0` state: `L_i = 0`, `S_i = 0`. Thus, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies `T_i = 1`.\nThe problem states the final NN state has `T_f(NN) = 0`.\nFor isospin to be conserved in the reaction, `T_i = T_f(NN) + T_x`.\n`1 = 0 + T_x`, so the emitted particle X must have isospin `T_x = 1`.\n\n**b) Particle X properties**\nParticle X has isospin `T_x = 1` and is given to have intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The most common particles fitting this description are pions (`π`, `π⁰`, `π⁺`), which are pseudoscalar mesons. This means they have spin `s_x = 0`. This is a crucial deduction.\n\n**c) Parity Conservation**\n`P_initial = P_final`\nThe initial parity is `P_i_total = +1`.\nThe final parity is `P_f_total = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`, where `l_x` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n*   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`, where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_x`.\n\nSo, the conservation equation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`\n`+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`\nThis requires the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` to be an even number. Therefore, `L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.\n\n**d) Angular Momentum Conservation**\n`J_initial = J_final` (vector sum).\n`J_i_total = 0`.\nThe total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j_x`).\n`j_x` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_x` and its spin `s_x`.\n`vec(J_f) + vec(l_x) + vec(s_x) = 0`.\nSince we deduced that `s_x = 0`, this simplifies to:\n`vec(J_f) + vec(l_x) = 0`.\nThis implies that the vectors `J_f` and `l_x` must have equal magnitude and opposite direction. Thus, their quantum numbers must be equal: `J_f = l_x`.\n\n**e) Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number for the final NN state to be a valid state with `T=0`.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe will check each option against our derived conditions:\n1.  **State Validity (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_x` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** `J_f = l_x`.\n\nLet's create a table for clarity. (Note: `s` -> `l=0`, `p` -> `l=1`, `d` -> `l=2`, `f` -> `l=3`)\n\n| Option | Final NN State `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` | Particle X (`l_x`) | (1) `S_f+L_f` odd? | (2) `L_f+l_x` odd? | (3) `J_f = l_x`? | Permitted? |\n|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **A** | `3S1` (S=1, L=0, J=1) | p (l=1) | 1+0=1 (Yes) | 0+1=1 (Yes) | 1 = 1 (Yes) | Yes |\n| **B** | `3P0` (S=1, L=1, J=0) | s (l=0) | 1+1=2 (**No**) | 1+0=1 (Yes) | 0 = 0 (Yes) | **No** |\n| **C** | `3D3` (S=1, L=2, J=3) | f (l=3) | 1+2=3 (Yes) | 2+3=5 (Yes) | 3 = 3 (Yes) | Yes |\n| **D** | `7D1` (S=3, L=2, J=1) | p (l=1) | 3+2=5 (Yes) | 2+1=3 (Yes) | 1 = 1 (Yes) | No* |\n\n**Analysis of the Results:**\n\n*   **Options A and C:** All three conditions are met. These transitions are permitted.\n*   **Option B:** Fails condition (1). The proposed final state, `3P0` with `T=0`, violates the Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` is even). Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because it would lead to a non-existent quantum state.\n*   **Option D:** This option is more complex. It passes all three checks derived from the problem's text. However, the final NN state `7D1` itself is fundamentally impossible. A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. The maximum total spin `S` they can form is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`. A state with `S=3` (which corresponds to `2S+1=7`) cannot be formed by two nucleons. Therefore, this transition is also not permitted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have two non-permitted transitions: B and D.\n*   The process in **B** is forbidden because the final NN state `(3P0, T=0)` violates the explicit Pauli statistics rule given in the problem.\n*   The process in **D** is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` is impossible to construct from two nucleons, a fact based on the rules of adding angular momentum.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, when a specific rule is provided (like the Pauli statistics formula), it is very likely intended to be the key to solving the problem. Option B is directly ruled out by this provided rule. The issue with Option D relies on an unstated (though fundamental) piece of knowledge. Therefore, Option B is the most direct and intended answer based on the problem's framing.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's interpret the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   This is consistent since `J_i` must be between `|L_i - S_i|` and `L_i + S_i`, which is just 0.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n*   `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Particle X\nThe process is: `Initial NN (1S0) -> Final NN ((2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)) + Particle X`.\n*   **Final NN state**: Has spin `S_f`, orbital angular momentum `L_f`, and total angular momentum `J_f`. Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`.\n*   **Particle X**:\n    *   Intrinsic parity is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its spin is `s_x`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the final NN system is `l_x`. The spectroscopic notation for `l_x` is given by the lowercase letters: `s` (l_x=0), `p` (l_x=1), `d` (l_x=2), `f` (l_x=3).\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Conditions\n\nThere are three key conditions that must be satisfied for a reaction to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_i = +1`\n*   The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_final = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`. The `(-1)^l_x` term comes from the parity of the spatial wave function for the relative motion of X.\n*   `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`.\n*   This means the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, the first condition is: **`L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.**\n\n**Condition 2: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states a condition for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f(NN) = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are also given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number (a multiple of 2).\n*   Therefore, the second condition is: **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n**Condition 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved.\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the angular momenta of the two final components: `J_f` (of the NN system), `l_x` (orbital of X), and `s_x` (spin of X).\n*   Vector sum: `J_f + l_x + s_x = J_final = 0`.\n*   This means the three angular momentum vectors must be able to form a closed triangle (or lie collinearly and sum to zero). The condition on their magnitudes is given by the triangle inequality. A reaction is permitted only if there exists a valid spin for particle X (`s_x >= 0`) that satisfies this. The general condition is **`|J_f - l_x| <= s_x <= J_f + l_x`**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each option.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave, based on a synthesis of the most consistent reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Reaction\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce the initial quantum numbers:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` for L implies the initial orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   The number `0` for J implies the initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The initial parity is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe reaction is the emission of a particle `X` from this state: `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: Has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`. The lowercase letters (`s, p, f`) denote its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. A common assumption for such emitted particles (like pions) is that they have zero intrinsic spin, so its total angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n*   **Final NN State (`NN_f`)**: Has quantum numbers `S_f, L_f, J_f` and a specified isospin of `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and physical principles. We can derive three main rules based on the information provided in the question:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved, their vector sum must be zero, which is only possible if their magnitudes are equal:\n    `J_f = l_X`\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The initial total parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parity of the final NN state, the intrinsic parity of particle X, and the parity from the orbital motion of X: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    The equation `P_i = P_f` becomes:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    For this to hold, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This implies that the sum of the orbital angular momenta must be odd:\n    `L_f + l_X = odd`\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem provides a specific requirement from the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`. Substituting this in gives:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This requires that `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number. Therefore, the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum for the final NN state must be odd:\n    `S_f + L_f = odd`\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the proposed transitions against these three rules. A transition is forbidden if it violates any rule. Additionally, we check if the final state is physically possible.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Analysis**: A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, a state with `S=3` is physically impossible for this system.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Not Permitted** (The final state is unphysical).\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-cons.):** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `0=0`. OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (P-cons.):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that the sum must be odd for a T=0 final state.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Not Permitted** (Violates the Pauli statistics rule).\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-cons.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `1=1`. OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (P-cons.):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J-cons.):** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `3=3`. OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (P-cons.):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). OK.\n*   **Conclusion**: **Permitted**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have identified two forbidden reactions: A and B.\n*   Reaction A is forbidden because the final NN state (`7D1`) is unphysical for a system of two nucleons.\n*   Reaction B is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle selection rule provided in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks for the partial wave that is not permitted and directs us to use the given conservation laws and the Pauli statistics rule. Reaction B is the one that is disallowed by a direct application of these specific rules. The issue with reaction A is the existence of the final state itself, which may be considered external to the transition rules being tested (and could be a typo). Therefore, the most consistent answer based on applying the problem's explicit constraints is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN system is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Particle X\nThe process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n*   **Final NN state (`NN_f`)**: It is described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The problem states we should assume its total isospin is `T_{NN_f} = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Governing Rules\nThe reaction must obey several conservation laws and principles. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics (as given)**\n    The problem provides a specific condition from the generalized Pauli exclusion principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are told to assume the final NN state has `T_{NN_f} = 0`. Plugging this into the formula:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**. Any final NN state where `S_f + L_f` is even will violate this condition and is therefore not permitted.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    `P_i = P_f`\n    `P_i = +1` (from the initial `1S0` state).\n    The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    So, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved. `J_i = J_f`.\n    `J_i = 0`. So, the total angular momentum of the final system must be `J_f = 0`.\n    The final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`), the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`), and its spin (`s_X`): `vec{J_f} = vec{J_{NN_f}} + vec{l_X} + vec{s_X}`.\n    For `J_f` to be zero, it must be possible to combine these three vectors to get zero. This is a broad condition, but it can be checked for each case. A simpler check, assuming `s_X=0`, would be `J_{NN_f} = l_X`. We will see if this assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Physicality of States**\n    The quantum states themselves must be physically possible. For a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 fermions), the total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the rules.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`S_f, L_f, J_f`) | Particle X (`l_X`) | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f` (must be odd?) | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X` (must be odd?) | Rule 4: `S_f` possible? |\n|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) `7D1` | S=3, L=2, J=1 | p (l=1) | 3+2 = 5 (**OK**) | 2+1 = 3 (**OK**) | `S=3` (**Forbidden**) |\n| B) `3D3` | S=1, L=2, J=3 | f (l=3) | 1+2 = 3 (**OK**) | 2+3 = 5 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| C) `3S1` | S=1, L=0, J=1 | p (l=1) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | 0+1 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n| D) `3P0` | S=1, L=1, J=0 | s (l=0) | 1+1 = 2 (**Forbidden**) | 1+0 = 1 (**OK**) | `S=1` (**OK**) |\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, we find two forbidden reactions:\n\n*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S=3` (`2S+1=7`). This is impossible, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`.\n*   **Option D (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics condition given in the problem. For the final state to have `T=0`, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be odd. For the `3P0` state, `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2`, which is even.\n\nWhen a multiple-choice question has two seemingly correct answers, it's often because one violates a condition explicitly provided in the problem statement, which is intended to be the primary focus. The problem explicitly gives the Pauli condition and the requirement that `T(NN_f)=0`. Option D is the only one that fails this specific test. The impossibility of state `7D1` in Option A relies on general background knowledge not explicitly written in the problem's rule set. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the test set up by the problem itself.\n\nThe state `3P0` is a valid NN state, but it must have T=1. The problem asks to consider a hypothetical transition to a `T=0` state. Since a `3P0` state cannot have `T=0`, the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Conservation Laws\n\nWe need to check which of the proposed reactions is forbidden. A reaction is forbidden if it violates a fundamental conservation law or a given physical principle. The relevant principles here are:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The final two-nucleon (NN) state must be consistent with the Pauli principle. The problem provides a specific condition for this.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   The initial state is a two-nucleon system (NN) in a **1S0** state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_initial = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Parity of the initial state:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum L is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   The final state consists of the final NN system and the emitted particle X.\n*   The reaction is: `NN_initial (1S0) -> NN_final + X`.\n\n**A. Conservation of Parity**\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_final` is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final`, where `L_final` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given in the problem).\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   Putting it together:\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_final + l_X)`\n*   This equation is satisfied only if `(-1)^(L_final + l_X) = -1`, which means the exponent `(L_final + l_X)` must be **odd**.\n\n**B. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial = 0`.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final(NN)`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`).\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X. A common simplification in such problems is to assume X is spinless (like a pion). If `s_X = 0`, then `J_X = l_X`.\n*   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum `J_final = J_final(NN) + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the following condition must hold:\n    `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`:\n    `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   This implies that `(S_final + L_final)` must be **odd**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final` must be odd.\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = l_X`.\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X` must be odd.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 0`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 1`, `J_final(NN) = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition. **FORBIDDEN.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 0`, `l_X = 0`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final = 1`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 3`, `l_X = 3`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final = 3`, `L_final = 2`, `J_final(NN) = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Note:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 (antiparallel) or S=1 (parallel). S=3 is physically impossible for this system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed. However, let's check the transition rules as requested by the problem structure.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_final + L_final = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J_final(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n3.  **Parity:** `L_final + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: The transition itself obeys all the conservation laws. The reaction is forbidden only because the final product `7D1` is not a possible state for two nucleons.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nComparing the options, option B is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle condition explicitly provided in the problem statement. Option D is forbidden for a different reason: the final state itself is unphysical. In the context of such problems, one should primarily focus on applying the given rules and conservation laws to the transition process. Option B fails one of these explicit checks, making it the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system (`NN_i`).\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum, so `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial system emits a particle X: `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s`: `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p`: `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f`: `l_X = 3`\n\n*   **Final State:** A final two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and particle X.\n    *   The final NN system has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Selection Rules (Conservation Laws)\n\nWe need to check three conditions for each proposed reaction. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of these rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN_f) = S(NN_f) + L(NN_f) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation is true only if `S_f + L_f` is an odd number.\n    *   **Condition 1:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial system (`J_i = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system.\n    *   The final system's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). (We assume particle X has no spin, which is standard for particles like pions denoted by `s, p, ...` states).\n    *   The conservation law is `vec{J_i} = vec{J_f} + vec{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, this implies `vec{J_f} + vec{l_X} = 0`, which can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n    *   **Condition 2:** `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state: `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final state's parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given intrinsic parity).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^{l_X}` (parity from the relative motion of X).\n    *   So, the conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`, or `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n    *   This requires the exponent to be odd.\n    *   **Condition 3:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each of the given reactions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Condition 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   The reaction is not permitted.\n\nSince we have already found a violation, this is the answer. For completeness, let's check the other options.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f = 3`. A two-nucleon system is made of two spin-1/2 particles, so its total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, this reaction is forbidden because the final state cannot exist.\n*   However, if we mechanically apply the selection rules as requested:\n    *   `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n    *   `l_X = 1`.\n    *   **Check 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n    *   **Check 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n    *   **Check 3 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   The process itself obeys all the given selection rules, but it leads to an impossible state. The question asks which *partial wave* is not permitted based on the given rules. Option A is the only one that violates one of those rules directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be odd. In this case, `1 + 1 = 2`, which is even.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers for this state:\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the isospin. For the initial state, we have `L_i = 0` and `S_i = 0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd. This requires the isospin of the initial state to be `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, for the initial state `1S0`: `J_i = 0`, `P_i = +1`, `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: It has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. The problem does not specify the spin of X. A common particle emitted in such decays is a pion (π), which has spin `S_X = 0`. We will assume `S_X = 0`, which is standard for this type of problem unless specified otherwise. The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3` respectively.\n*   **Final NN state**: It has isospin `T_f = 0`. Its quantum numbers are given by the term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n\nWe must check three conservation laws and one statistical rule:\n\n**A. Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's total angular momentum `J_X`. `vec{J}_{final} = vec{J}_f + vec{J}_X`.\n*   With `S_X = 0`, `vec{J}_X = vec{l}_X + vec{S}_X = vec{l}_X`, so `J_X = l_X`.\n*   For `vec{J}_{final}` to be zero, we must be able to couple `vec{J}_f` and `vec{l}_X` to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity from their relative orbital motion: `P_{final} = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n*   `P_{NN_f} = (-1)^{L_f}` and `P_X = -1`.\n*   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   For this equation to hold, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**C. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem explicitly states the condition from Pauli statistics: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   This, in turn, implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\nA transition is \"not permitted\" if it violates any of these three conditions.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each of the proposed final states against our three conditions.\n\n| Option | Reaction               | Final NN State (`L_f`, `S_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | **Pauli?** (`S_f+L_f` odd) | **Parity?** (`L_f+l_X` odd) | **Ang.

Although it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum and parity, it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state. For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f + L_f = 2` (even). According to the Pauli principle for a `T_f=0` state, `S_f + L_f` must be odd. Therefore, a `3P0` state with `T=0` cannot exist for a two-nucleon system, and the transition is forbidden.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe system starts as a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`, we have `2S+1 = 1`, which means the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The particle X is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X`. The lowercase letters denote this: `s` (l=0), `p` (l=1), `d` (l=2), `f` (l=3).\n*   The final NN state has quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and constraints:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved (`J_final = J_i = 0`), we must have `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:**\n    The parity of the initial state is `P_i = +1`. The parity of the final state is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(relative motion)`.\n    `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This equation holds if and only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived conditions:\n1.  `J_f = l_X`\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd\n\n| Option | Reaction               | NN Final State (`S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`) | X State (`l_X`) | `J_f = l_X`? | `L_f + l_X` is odd? | `S_f + L_f` is odd? | Permitted? |\n| :----: | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :--------- |\n| **A)** | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`       | S=1, L=1, J=0                        | l=0             | 0 = 0 (Yes)  | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 1 = 2 (**No**)  | **No**     |\n| **B)** | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`       | S=1, L=2, J=3                        | l=3             | 3 = 3 (Yes)  | 2 + 3 = 5 (Yes)     | 1 + 2 = 3 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n| **C)** | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`       | S=3, L=2, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 2 + 1 = 3 (Yes)     | 3 + 2 = 5 (Yes)     | Yes*       |\n| **D)** | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`       | S=1, L=0, J=1                        | l=1             | 1 = 1 (Yes)  | 0 + 1 = 1 (Yes)     | 1 + 0 = 1 (Yes)     | Yes        |\n\n\\*Note on Option C: The final state `7D1` implies a spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. Thus, the state `7D1` is physically impossible. However, when strictly applying the rules *given in the problem*, this transition is formally allowed. The question asks to identify the non-permitted partial wave based on the provided conservation laws and Pauli condition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, reaction A is the only one that violates one of the conditions explicitly derived from the problem statement. It fails the Pauli statistics requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f=0` final state.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (NN_i):** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => `S_i = 0` (total spin).\n    *   `L = S` => `L_i = 0` (orbital angular momentum).\n    *   `J = 0` => `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum).\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** `NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n    *   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to `NN_f` is denoted `L_X`. (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state: `J_i = J_f`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the `NN_f` system's total angular momentum (`J_NN`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle `X` (`L_X`): `J_f = J_NN + L_X`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `J_f = 0`. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_NN = L_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    *   The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state: `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_NN`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(orbital) = (-1)^L_X`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = -(-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L_NN + L_X) = -1`.\n    *   This implies that the sum `L_NN + L_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State (NN_f):**\n    *   The problem states that for the final `NN_f` state, `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   It also provides the condition from the Pauli exclusion principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN_f) = 0`, we get `0 = S_NN + L_NN + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if and only if `S_NN + L_NN` is an odd number.\n\n### 2. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_NN = L_X`\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_NN + L_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** For `T_NN = 0`, `S_NN + L_NN` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state (`7D1`): `2S_NN+1=7` -> `S_NN=3`. `L_NN=2` (D-state). `J_NN=1`.\n*   This state is impossible for a two-nucleon system. Nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, so their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. S=3 is not possible. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3S1`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=0`, `J_NN=1`.\n*   Particle `X` (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   All conditions are met. This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3P0`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=1`, `J_NN=0`.\n*   Particle `X` (`s`): `L_X=0`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**✗**)\n*   The Pauli principle condition is violated. This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3D3`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=2`, `J_NN=3`.\n*   Particle `X` (`f`): `L_X=3`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `3 = 3`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   All conditions are met. This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and C describe non-permitted transitions. However, the reason for A (`S=3`) is that the final state is fundamentally impossible to construct with two nucleons. This is likely a typo in the question. The reason for C is a violation of the specific Pauli statistics rule that the question explicitly asks to be used. The state `3P0` itself is a valid state for two nucleons, but not if it has isospin `T=0`. The transition is forbidden because the final `(T=0, S=1, L=1)` state violates the Pauli principle. Given the explicit instruction in the problem, this is the intended violation to be found.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial system is a pair of nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => `S_i = 0` (Total spin is 0, a singlet state).\n    *   `L = S` => `L_i = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum is 0).\n    *   `J = 0` => `J_i = 0` (Total angular momentum is 0).\n*   The parity of the initial state `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = P_N1 * P_N2 * (-1)^L_i`. Since nucleons have intrinsic parity `+1`, this is `P_i = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_f((2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)) + X(l_X)`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final isospin is `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN)=0`, the condition becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved, so `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X.\n    *   Parity of final NN state: `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   Parity of particle X: `P(X) = P_X_intrinsic * (-1)^{l_X}`. We are given `P_X_intrinsic = -1`. So, `P(X) = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Therefore, `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `vec{J_i} = vec{J_f_total}`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The total final angular momentum `vec{J_f_total}` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum `vec{J_f}` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `vec{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `vec{J_f} + vec{l_X} = 0`.\n    *   This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`. (The vector sum `|J_f - l_X| <= J_total <= J_f + l_X` must include 0).\n\n**Summary of Conditions to Check:**\nA transition is permitted only if all three conditions are met for the final state `(S_f, L_f, J_f)` and the emitted particle `(l_X)`:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's create a table to check each option against the three conditions. The spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum is: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n| Option | Final NN State `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` | Particle `X(l_X)` | `S_f` | `L_f` | `J_f` | `l_X` | (1) `S_f+L_f`=odd? | (2) `L_f+l_X`=odd? | (3) `J_f=l_X`? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A | `3S1` | p | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0+1=1` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | Yes |\n| B | `7D1` | p | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | `3+2=5` (Yes) | `2+1=3` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | Yes * |\n| C | `3D3` | f | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | `1+2=3` (Yes) | `2+3=5` (Yes) | `3=3` (Yes) | Yes |\n| D | `3P0` | s | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | `1+1=2` (No) | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0=0` (Yes) | **No** |\n\n*\\*Note on Option B: The state `7D1` implies `S_f=3`. This is not physically possible for a two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles can only form total spin S=0 or S=1). However, the transition does not violate any of the three rules explicitly tested (Pauli, Parity, Angular Momentum conservation). The violation in Option D is a direct failure of one of these specified rules.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption D is the only transition that violates one of the required conditions. Specifically, the final NN state `3P0` has `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`, so `S_f+L_f = 2` (even). This violates the Pauli principle condition (`S_f+L_f` must be odd) for a `T(NN)=0` final state. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the solution.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n    *   For `1S0`:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L` is 'S' => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J` is '0' => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Reaction:** The initial NN system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the final NN system is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which we'll call `l_X`.\n        *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n\n### 2. Establish the Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three rules: angular momentum conservation, parity conservation, and the given Pauli statistics condition.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (`J_{total, f}`).\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X has no intrinsic spin (or it's not coupled), its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n    *   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` must be zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    *   The total parity of the initial state (`P_i`) must equal the total parity of the final state (`P_f`).\n    *   `P_i = P_{NN, i} = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   `P_f = P_{NN, f} * P_{X, intrinsic} * P_{X, orbital}`.\n        *   `P_{NN, f} = (-1)^{L_f}` (where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state).\n        *   `P_{X, intrinsic} = -1` (given).\n        *   `P_{X, orbital} = (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This means `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics / Isospin Condition**\n    *   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed reaction against these three rules. A reaction is not permitted if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `0 = 0`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 1 = 2`. **(FAIL)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli/Isospin condition.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `0 + 1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Note: A `7D1` state implies `2S+1=7`, or `S=3`. This is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, where the maximum spin is `S=1`. However, we will test it against the given rules as a formalism.\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `2 + 1 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `3 + 2 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   This reaction is permitted based on the formal rules provided.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J_f = l_X):** `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (L_f + l_X is odd):** `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (S_f + L_f is odd):** `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly option A violates one of the fundamental rules outlined in the problem. The sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum (`S_f + L_f`) is even, whereas the Pauli/Isospin condition for `T=0` requires it to be odd. Therefore, this partial wave is not permitted.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is `S`, which corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is `0`, so the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n*   `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial system `NN_i` decays into a final two-nucleon system `NN_f` and a particle `X`.\n`NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n\nThe particle `X` has:\n*   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   Orbital angular momentum `l_X` relative to the `NN_f` system. The lowercase letters (`s`, `p`, `f`) denote `l_X = 0, 1, 3` respectively.\n\nWe must apply three main conservation laws and principles:\n\n**a) Parity Conservation:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n`P_initial = P_final`\n`P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P_X * P_orbital`\nThe orbital parity is due to the emitted particle X, which is `(-1)^l_X`. The parity of the final NN state is `(-1)^L_f`.\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n`+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\nFor this equation to hold, the exponent `(L_f + l_X + 1)` must be an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**b) Angular Momentum Conservation:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the `NN_f` system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`). Assuming particle X is spinless (or its spin is not relevant to the partial wave notation), its angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n`J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum)\nSince `J_i = 0`, the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` must be able to result in 0. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, `J_f = l_X`, or more generally, if `0` is a possible value in the range `|J_f - l_X|` to `|J_f + l_X|`.\n\n**c) Pauli Statistics for the Final State:**\nThe problem states that for the final `NN` state, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T_f + S_f + L_f` being an odd number.\nWe are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the condition: `0 + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\nTherefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nNow we will check each proposed transition against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. The vector sum is `0`. Matches `J_i=0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **This violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. The vector sum can range from `|1-1|=0` to `1+1=2`. Since `0` is a possible result, it can match `J_i=0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f = 3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). An `S=3` state is impossible. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed, and the transition is not permitted. However, it's instructive to check the given rules.\n*   `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. The vector sum can be `0`, `1`, or `2`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition satisfies all the explicitly stated conservation laws and statistical rules. It is only \"not permitted\" because the final NN state is physically impossible, a fact external to the listed rules. Given that option A directly violates one of the stated rules, it is the more likely intended answer.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check a (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Check b (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. The vector sum can range from `|3-3|=0` to `3+3=6`. Since `0` is a possible result, it can match `J_i=0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Check c (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is permitted.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the Pauli statistics rule (`S_f + L_f` must be odd) that was explicitly given to be checked for a final state with `T_f = 0`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n*   **Initial State**: The system starts with two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. We use the spectroscopic notation `(2S+1)L(J)` to find the initial quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` corresponds to an initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` indicates the total initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Initial Parity**: The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. Therefore, the initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **The Reaction**: The NN system emits a particle X, so the reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   **Particle X**: We are given that particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum state is denoted by a lowercase letter (s, p, d, f), which corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`, respectively.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy several conditions:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the final state (`J_f`) must equal the total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i`).\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final state consists of `NN_final` (with total angular momentum `J_f(NN)`) and particle `X` (with orbital angular momentum `l_X`). We assume X is spinless. The total final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of `J_f(NN)` and `l_X`.\n    *   For the vector sum `J_f(NN) + l_X` to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity**: The parity of the final state (`P_f`) must equal the parity of the initial state (`P_i`).\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X_system)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`, where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P(X_system) = P_X * (-1)^l_X = (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   For `P_f = +1`, we must have `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`. This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X` to be **odd**.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for Nucleons**: The problem provides a specific rule for the final NN state when its isospin `T(NN) = 0`:\n    *   `T(NN) = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option Against the Conditions\n\nLet's create a checklist for each reaction. A reaction is permitted only if it passes all three tests.\n1.  **J-Conservation**: `J_f(NN) = l_X`?\n2.  **P-Conservation**: `L_f + l_X` is odd?\n3.  **Pauli Principle**: `S_f + L_f` is odd?\n\n---\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   `NN_final` state is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`.

(Note: While a `S=3` state is physically impossible for two nucleons, the reaction does not violate any of the rules we were instructed to use).\n\nBased on the analysis, the only reaction that fails the specified conditions is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the permitted and non-permitted transitions.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe system starts as a bound two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial NN state is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` implies the total orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe initial state decays into a final NN state and a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\nWe are given the following information and must apply the corresponding conservation laws:\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n*   The transition must conserve total angular momentum and parity.\n*   The final NN state must obey the Pauli statistics rule provided.\n\nLet's establish the rules that a permitted transition must satisfy. The quantum numbers for the final NN state are `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`, and for particle X, the orbital angular momentum is `l_X`.\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe initial total angular momentum `J_i` must equal the final total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n*   `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum)\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, this means `0 = J_f + l_X`.\n*   This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe initial total parity `P_i` must equal the final total parity `P_f`.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   `P_f` is the product of the parity of the final NN state (`P_{NN,f} = (-1)^{L_f}`), the orbital parity of particle X (`(-1)^{l_X}`), and the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P_X = -1`).\n*   `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n*   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides the condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For the final state, we are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nNow we test each of the proposed transitions against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Ang.

(**✗ Fail**)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final NN state.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Ang.

(✓ Pass)\n*   This transition is **permitted** according to the given rules.\n\nThe only transition that fails to satisfy all the required conditions is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to check each proposed reaction against three main rules:\n1.  The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n2.  The conservation of total angular momentum (J).\n3.  The conservation of parity (P).\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial state (`i`):\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => `S_i = 0` (total spin)\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) => `L_i = 0` (orbital angular momentum)\n    *   `J = 0` => `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum)\n\n*   **Parity of the initial state (`P_i`)**: The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Isospin of the initial state (`T_i`)**: The generalized Pauli principle for two identical fermions (nucleons) requires their total wave function to be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition that `L + S + T` must be an odd number.\n    *   For the initial state: `L_i + S_i + T_i = odd`\n    *   `0 + 0 + T_i = odd` => `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is characterized by `J_i^P = 0^+` and `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and an emitted particle `X`.\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get: `0 = (S_f + L_f + 1) mod 2`.\n*   This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number.\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity must be conserved: `P_i = P_f`.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the NN system.\n*   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For `P_i = P_f`, we need `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_i = J_f_total`.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The total final angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`J_X`).\n*   So, `vec(J_f) + vec(J_X) = 0`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = J_X`.\n*   The total angular momentum of particle X, `J_X`, is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum (`l_X`) and its intrinsic spin (`s_X`): `vec(J_X) = vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`.\n*   The triangle inequality requires `|l_X - s_X| <= J_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n*   Since `J_f = J_X`, the condition is: `|l_X - s_X| <= J_f <= l_X + s_X`. Since `s_X` is not specified, we just need to check if there *exists* a possible non-negative spin `s_X` that satisfies this relation.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three rules. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` is `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. We need to find `s_X` such that `|1 - s_X| <= 1 <= 1 + s_X`. If `s_X = 1`, `J_X` can be 0, 1, or 2. Thus, `J_X = 1` is possible. **OK.**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` is `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   `X` is `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. We need to find `s_X` such that `|3 - s_X| <= 3 <= 3 + s_X`. If `s_X = 0`, `J_X = 3`. **OK.**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` is `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   `X` is `s`: `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T_f = 0` state. **NOT PERMITTED.**\n*   This reaction is forbidden. We do not need to check the other rules.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` is `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   `X` is `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. If `s_X = 0`, `J_X = 1`. **OK.**\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\nThe only reaction that violates the fundamental principles is C, as the final `NN` state (`3P0` with `T=0`) is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n*   The initial system is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (initial total spin).\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies `L_i = 0` (initial orbital angular momentum).\n    *   `J = 0` implies `J_i = 0` (initial total angular momentum).\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n*   The final state consists of a two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   The quantum numbers for the final NN state are `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `l_x` (where `s`=0, `p`=1, `d`=2, `f`=3).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Parity**\n*   Parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n*   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n*   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n*   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_x`.\n*   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_x)`.\n*   Equating `P_initial` and `P_final`: `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l_x)`.\n*   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_x) = -1`.\n*   This implies that the sum `L_f + l_x` must be an **odd** number for the transition to be allowed.\n\n**4. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n*   The problem states a requirement from Pauli statistics for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number. `(odd) + 1 = (even) = 0 (mod 2)`.\n*   So, any permitted final NN state must have `S_f + L_f` be an odd number.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f` must also be 0.\n*   `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f(NN)`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_x`). `j_x` itself is the vector sum of its orbital (`l_x`) and spin (`s_x`) angular momenta.\n*   The condition is `vec(J_f(NN)) + vec(l_x) + vec(s_x) = 0`.\n*   This means that the three angular momenta `J_f(NN)`, `l_x`, and `s_x` must be able to form a closed triangle. This is possible if they satisfy the triangle inequality, e.g., `|J_f(NN) - l_x| <= s_x <= J_f(NN) + l_x`. Since the spin `s_x` of particle X is not given, we assume that a suitable `s_x` can exist unless other rules are violated.\n\n**6. Evaluate Each Option**\nLet's check each option against the rules, starting with the most restrictive ones. The Pauli principle provides a strict condition on the allowed final NN states.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state: `p`-wave, so `l_x=1`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   **Parity check:** `L_f + l_x = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   This transition is allowed.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2` (D-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. `S=3` is physically impossible. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed. This transition is not permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1` (P-state), `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state: `s`-wave, so `l_x=0`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for a `T=0` state.\n*   Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state: `f`-wave, so `l_x=3`.\n*   **Pauli check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   **Parity check:** `L_f + l_x = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). This is permitted.\n*   This transition is allowed.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have identified two non-permitted transitions:\n*   B is impossible because the final NN state `7D1` has `S=3`, which cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   C is impossible because the final NN state `3P0` with `T=0` violates the Pauli exclusion principle, a rule explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, you are expected to use the rules given. Option C is ruled out directly by applying the Pauli statistics rule from the problem prompt. While option B is also impossible, it relies on assumed knowledge (addition of angular momentum for two spin-1/2 particles) that is not explicitly stated in the problem's constraints. The violation in C is a direct contradiction of the given premises. Therefore, C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to find the non-permitted transition.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (NN system):** `1S0`\n    *   This is in the `(2S+1)L(J)` notation.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` which means initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` which means initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`).\n    *   To conserve `J`, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).

Parity Conservation:**\nThe total parity must be conserved.\n`P(initial) = P(final)`\n`P(initial_NN) = P(final_NN) * P(X) * P(orbital)`\nwhere `P(orbital) = (-1)^l(X)` is the parity of the relative motion between the final NN system and particle X.\n*   `+1 = (-1)^L' * (-1) * (-1)^l(X)`\n*   `+1 = (-1)^(L' + l(X) + 1)`\nThis equation holds true only if the exponent `L' + l(X) + 1` is an even number. This means `L' + l(X)` must be **odd**.\n*   **Rule 1: `L' + l(X)` must be odd.**\n\n**B. Angular Momentum Conservation:**\nThe total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J'` and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X is spinless (as is common in such problems unless specified otherwise), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l(X)`.\n`J(initial) = J(final_NN) + l(X)` (vector sum)\n`0 = J' + l(X)`\nThis vector addition requires that the magnitudes be equal.\n*   **Rule 2: `J' = l(X)`**\n\n**C. Pauli Principle:**\nThe problem explicitly states a requirement from Pauli statistics for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven that the final state has `T(NN) = 0`, we have:\n`0 = S' + L' + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means `S' + L' + 1` must be an even number, which implies `S' + L'` must be **odd**.\n*   **Rule 3: `S' + L'` must be odd.**\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each proposed transition against these three rules.\n\n| Option | Transition            | Final NN State (`S'`, `L'`, `J'`) | Particle X (`l(X)`) | Rule 1: `L'+l(X)` odd? | Rule 2: `J'=l(X)`? | Rule 3: `S'+L'` odd? | Permitted? |\n|:------:|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|:--------------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|:----------------------|:----------:|\n|   A    | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`      | S'=1, L'=2, J'=3                  | l=3                 | 2+3=5 (Yes)            | 3=3 (Yes)           | 1+2=3 (Yes)           | Yes        |\n|   B    | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`      | S'=3, L'=2, J'=1                  | l=1                 | 2+1=3 (Yes)            | 1=1 (Yes)           | 3+2=5 (Yes)           | **No***    |\n|   C    | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`      | S'=1, L'=0, J'=1                  | l=1                 | 0+1=1 (Yes)            | 1=1 (Yes)           | 1+0=1 (Yes)           | Yes        |\n|   D    | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`      | S'=1, L'=1, J'=0                  | l=0                 | 1+0=1 (Yes)            | 0=0 (Yes)           | 1+1=2 (**No**)        | **No**     |\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Transitions A and C are permitted as they satisfy all three rules.\n*   Transition B involves a final state `7D1`. This implies `2S'+1=7`, so `S'=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A spin of `S=3` is impossible. Therefore, this transition is forbidden because the final state cannot exist.\n*   Transition D involves a final state `3P0` with `S'=1` and `L'=1`. For this transition, `S'+L' = 1+1=2`, which is even. This violates Rule 3, which requires `S'+L'` to be odd for a `T=0` final state.\n\nBoth B and D are forbidden transitions. However, the question specifically provides the Pauli statistics rule and asks you to use it along with conservation laws. Option D is the only one that violates this explicitly stated rule (`T = S+L+1 mod 2` for `T=0`). The violation in option B stems from a more basic principle of spin addition that is assumed as prerequisite knowledge, not from the rules explicitly highlighted in the problem prompt. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the specific test mentioned in the question.\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because the final NN state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) has `S+L=2` (even), which is forbidden by the Pauli principle for a `T=0` state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation for L=0) implies the orbital angular momentum `L(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   **Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X: `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   It has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f...`) denotes its orbital angular momentum state, `L(X)`. So, `s` means `L(X)=0`, `p` means `L(X)=1`, `f` means `L(X)=3`.\n    *   We will assume particle X has no spin (`S(X)=0`), so its total angular momentum is `J(X) = L(X)`. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN final) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Conservation Laws and Principles\n\nFor a reaction to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant physical laws. The key ones here are:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As nucleons are identical fermions, the total wavefunction of the two-nucleon system must be antisymmetric under their exchange.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Conditions for a Permitted Reaction\n\nLet's translate the laws into specific conditions for this problem. Let `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f` be the quantum numbers for the final NN state.\n\n1.  **J-Conservation:**\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's angular momentum (`J(X) = L(X)`).\n    *   `vec(J(initial)) = vec(J_f) + vec(J(X))`\n    *   `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(L_X)`\n    *   This implies that the vectors must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For the quantum numbers, this means their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = L(X)`.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:**\n    *   The parity of a system is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`. For a two-nucleon system, the intrinsic parity is `(+1)*(+1)=+1`.\n    *   `P(initial) = P(NN, 1S0) = (-1)^L(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN, final) * P(X, intrinsic) * P(X, orbital)`\n    *   `P(final) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L(X) = (-1)^(L_f + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P(initial) = P(final)`, so `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + L(X) + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + L(X)` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the condition as `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to the standard requirement that `L+S+T` must be odd for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Plugging this into the condition: `L_f + S_f + 0` must be odd.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + S_f` must be **odd**.\n\n### 4. Test Each Option Against the Conditions\n\nA reaction is forbidden if it fails even one of these three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2` (D-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X)=1`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0` (S-state), `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `L(X)=1`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2` (D-state), `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `L(X)=3`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   This reaction is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1` (P-state), `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `L(X)=0`.\n*   1. **J-Conservation:** `J_f = L(X)`? -> `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n*   2. **Parity:** `L_f + L(X)` is odd? -> `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   3. **Pauli:** `L_f + S_f` is odd? -> `1 + 1 = 2`. (Fail)\n*   The sum `L_f + S_f` is even, which violates the Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon state with `T_f = 0`. Therefore, the final state `NN(3P0)` with `T=0` cannot exist.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is not permitted because it requires the formation of a final `3P0` two-nucleon state with `T=0`, which is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`. This is a spin-singlet state.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Decay and Final State\n\nThe decay is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n*   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n\n### 3. Establish the Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for a transition to be permitted:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics:** The problem gives a specific constraint for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since we are given `T(NN_f) = 0`, the rule becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Therefore, the sum of the final spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN system (`S_f + L_f`) must be an **odd** integer.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be conserved, so `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n        *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n        *   `P_orbital` is the parity from the relative orbital motion of the final particles, given by `(-1)^{l_X}`, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`). For the total to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n    *   The particle X is emitted in a specific angular momentum state (`s`, `p`, `f`, etc.), which defines its orbital angular momentum `l_X`. In problems of this type, unless specified otherwise, the emitted particle `X` is typically assumed to be spinless (like a pion), so its spin `s_X = 0`. In this case, `j_X = l_X + s_X = l_X`.\n    *   Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum requires `J_f = l_X`.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each proposed final state against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them. The spectroscopic notation for `l_X` is `s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted by the given rules. (Note: A spin `S=3` state is physically impossible for two nucleons, but the question asks to check the transition rules, and this option passes them).\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION**. This violates the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. **OK**.\n*   Because this transition violates the Pauli statistics constraint, it is **not permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates one of the fundamental rules specified in the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\nThe initial system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` (spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum) means `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum of the initial system is `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe initial parity `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = P_N * P_N * (-1)^L_i`. Since nucleons have intrinsic parity `P_N = +1`, this gives `P_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe system decays into a final two-nucleon state (`NN_f`) and a particle `X`.\n`1S0 -> NN_f + X`\n\nWe must apply three main rules as specified in the problem:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state**: The problem gives the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. It also specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This is equivalent to stating that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number for the reaction to be allowed.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity must be conserved, so `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l`, where `l` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the final NN system.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   The problem states particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l = -(-1)^(L_f + l)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_i = P_f`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l)`.\n    *   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l) = -1`, which means `L_f + l` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J_i = J_f`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum `J(NN_f)` and particle X's total angular momentum `J(X)`.\n    *   The term symbol for `NN_f` gives us `J(NN_f)`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`) gives us the orbital angular momentum `l` of particle X. Assuming particle X is spinless (which is standard unless specified otherwise), its total angular momentum is `J(X) = l`.\n    *   So, `J_f` results from coupling `J(NN_f)` and `l`. For `J_f` to be `0`, it must be possible to obtain `0` from the vector addition, which requires `J(NN_f)` and `l` to be in a coupling that includes `0`. This is possible if `|J(NN_f) - l| <= 0 <= J(NN_f) + l`, which is always true if `J(NN_f) = l`. More generally, we just need `0` to be a possible outcome of the vector sum.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions.

The sum must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=0`, `l=0`. Vector sum `|0-0|...|0+0|` is `0`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle condition for a `T=0` final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f`: `3D3` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J(NN_f)=3`.\n*   `X`: `f`-wave -> `l=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=3`, `l=3`. Vector sum `|3-3|...|3+3|` is `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f`: `7D1` -> `2S+1=7` so `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J(NN_f)=1`.\n*   `X`: `p`-wave -> `l=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have total spin S=0 or S=1. Thus, `S=3` is physically impossible. However, the question asks us to check the given rules. Let's strictly apply the rules from the prompt.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons.

The reason it's truly impossible is that the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons, a fact that is outside the explicit checklist provided in the question's text.\n\n### Final Decision\nComparing the options, only reaction B violates one of the explicit conditions given in the problem statement (the Pauli statistics rule for T=0). Therefore, it is the one that is \"not permitted\" based on the problem's constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the initial total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` denotes the initial total orbital angular momentum, which corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the initial total angular momentum of the NN system, so `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial NN state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n*   `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial NN system emits a particle X, leading to the reaction: `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n\nWe must apply the conservation of total angular momentum and parity.\n\n**A. Angular Momentum Conservation:**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved. The initial state has `J_i = 0`. The final state consists of the final NN system (with its own total angular momentum `j_f`) and the particle X (with orbital angular momentum `l_X` relative to the NN system). Particle X is stated to be spinless as its state is denoted by a lowercase letter for orbital angular momentum.\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_i = j_f + l_X` (vector sum)\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, the vector sum of `j_f` and `l_X` must be zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `j_f = l_X`.\n\n**B. Parity Conservation:**\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_initial = +1` (as calculated above).\n*   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`, where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n    *   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given in the problem).\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`, which is the parity associated with the orbital motion of particle X.\n*   So, the conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n*   `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n*   This simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l_X` is an odd number.\n\n### 3. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe problem provides a specific condition based on Pauli statistics for the final NN state:\n*   `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\nWe are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`. Substituting this into the formula:\n*   `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation requires the sum `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number. This is equivalent to requiring `S_f + L_f` to be an odd number.\n\n### 4. Summary of Conditions for an Allowed Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met for the final state:\n1.  **Pauli Condition:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **J Conservation:** `j_f = l_X`.\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each of the given transitions against these three rules. The notation for the final NN state is `(2S_f+1)L_f(j_f)` and for particle X is its orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `j_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Cons:** `j_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **P-Cons:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. This state is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. While this immediately disqualifies the transition, for completeness, let's check the rules given in the problem. `L_f=2`, `j_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.** (Based on the numbers given)\n2.  **J-Cons:** `j_f = 1` and `l_X = 1`. **OK.**\n3.  **P-Cons:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition satisfies all the dynamic rules provided in the prompt. However, it is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `j_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **J-Cons:** `j_f = 3` and `l_X = 3`. **OK.**\n3.  **P-Cons:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `j_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **FAILS.**\n2.  **J-Cons:** `j_f = 0` and `l_X = 0`. **OK.**\n3.  **P-Cons:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: This transition violates the Pauli principle condition required for a final state with `T=0`. Therefore, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWe have identified two non-permitted transitions:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` (S=3) cannot be formed from two nucleons.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule given in the problem for a final state with `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks you to use the provided information, which includes the specific formulation of the Pauli principle (`T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`) and the condition `T=0`. Option D is the only one that fails this explicit check. The issue with option B is a more fundamental fact about the composition of the system, which is not part of the explicit rules the question directs you to use. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that is invalidated by the specific rules provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_initial = 0`.\n*   `L` is `S`, which in spectroscopic notation means orbital angular momentum `L_initial = 0`.\n*   `J` is `0`, so the total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial NN state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and the Emitted Particle\nThe system transitions to a final state consisting of a two-nucleon system (`NN_final`) and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   **Particle X:** It has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, is denoted by the lowercase letters (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN state:** The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_final_NN = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must obey several rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\n    The problem explicitly states a requirement from Pauli statistics for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Since we are given `T(NN) = 0`, the condition becomes:\n    `0 = S_final_NN + L_final_NN + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_final_NN + L_final_NN = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_final_NN + L_final_NN = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means the sum of the final NN state's spin (`S_final_NN`) and orbital angular momentum (`L_final_NN`) must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state (`J_initial = J_final`).\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_final_NN`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X`). We assume X is a spinless particle (like a pion), so its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   The conservation law is `vec{J_initial} = vec{J_final_NN} + vec{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `vec{J_initial} = 0`, we must have `vec{J_final_NN} + vec{l_X} = 0`. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_final_NN = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state (`P_initial = P_final`).\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P_final_NN * P_X * P_orbital`.\n    *   `P_final_NN = (-1)^L_final_NN`.\n    *   `P_X = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the wavefunction for relative motion).\n    *   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_final_NN * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L_final_NN + l_X)`.\n    *   The conservation law is `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_final_NN + l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `(-1)^(L_final_NN + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_final_NN + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` => `S=3`. `L=2, J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is **not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the Pauli principle requirement** that `S+L` must be odd for a T=0 state.\n*   Let's check the other rules for completeness.\n*   **Rule 2 (Ang. Mom.):** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Rule 3 (Parity):** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state `3P0` with `T=0` is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nBoth options B and D describe forbidden transitions. However, they are forbidden for different reasons.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system (spin cannot be 3). This is often considered a typo in such problems.\n*   Option D is forbidden because it violates a specific selection rule (`S+L` must be odd for T=0) that was explicitly provided in the problem statement as a consequence of Pauli statistics.\n\nIn the context of a physics problem, when a specific rule is given, you are expected to use it. Option D is the only one that violates this explicitly stated rule. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers using the notation `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S' => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is '0' => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe intrinsic parity of the initial NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule: `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where `T` is the total isospin. For the initial `1S0` state (`L_i=0, S_i=0`), we have `(-1)^(0+0+T_i) = -1`, which means `(-1)^(T_i) = -1`. This requires `T_i` to be odd. The lowest possible value is `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe system decays as `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply several rules to determine if a transition is permitted.\n\n**Constraint 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt also specifies that the final NN state has `T(NN, final) = 0`.\nSubstituting `T=0` into the given rule:\n`0 = S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means that `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1` must be an even number.\nThis is equivalent to requiring `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_f`\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system, `J(NN, final)`, and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\nSo, `J_f = J(NN, final) + L(X)`.\nFor `J_f` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN, final) = L(X)`.\n\n**Constraint 3: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity `P` must be conserved.\n`P_i = P_f`\nThe initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_f = P(NN, final) * P(X) * (-1)^(L(X))`.\n*   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^(L(NN, final))`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `(-1)^(L(X))` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of X.\n\nSo, the conservation equation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final)) * (-1) * (-1)^(L(X))`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\n`-1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X))`\nThis requires the exponent `L(NN, final) + L(X)` to be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\nWe now apply these three constraints to each proposed final state. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these constraints. The lowercase letters (s, p, f) denote `L(X)`: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). The sum must be odd. **This rule is VIOLATED.**\n*   Constraint 2 (J conservation): `J(NN)=0`, `L(X)=0`. `0=0`. (Satisfied).\n*   Constraint 3 (P conservation): `L(NN) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nSince the Pauli principle is violated, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=3`, `L(X)=3`. `3=3`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: This notation implies `2S+1=7`, which means `S=3`.\n*   A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their spins can only combine to a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system to have `S=3`.\n*   Therefore, the final state `7D1` does not exist for this system, and the transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Pauli):** `S + L = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 2 (J conservation):** `J(NN)=1`, `L(X)=1`. `1=1`. (Satisfied).\n*   **Constraint 3 (P conservation):** `L(NN) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). (Satisfied).\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" transitions:\n*   A) is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state.\n*   C) is not permitted because the proposed final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, a physically impossible state like `7D1` is almost always a typo. The question is designed to test the application of conservation laws and symmetry principles to the dynamics of the decay. Option A represents a transition between two valid states that is forbidden by one of these specific principles given in the problem. This is a much more likely intended answer than one that relies on identifying a typo. Assuming `C` was a typo for a valid state like `3D1` (which would be a permitted transition), then `A` is the unique answer that is not permitted due to the violation of the physical laws governing the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the intended answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => The total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` => The initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` => The total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`. This is consistent since `J_i` must be between `|L_i - S_i|` and `L_i + S_i`, which is just 0.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Reaction and Final State\nThe reaction is the emission of a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`, is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Represented by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   **Final System:** `NN(final) + X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nWe need to check three conditions for the reaction to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `J_initial` = `J_i` = 0.\n*   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `J_final` can range from `|J_f - l_X|` to `J_f + l_X`.\n*   For `J_final` to be equal to `J_initial = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal:\n    **`J_f = l_X`** (C1)\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n*   `P_initial` = Parity of the NN(1S0) state = `(-1)^L_i` = `(-1)^0` = `+1`.\n*   `P_final` = `P_NN(final) * P_X(emitted)`.\n    *   `P_NN(final)` = `(-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P_X(emitted)` = `P_X(intrinsic) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X` = `(-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be an even number. This implies that:\n    **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.** (C2)\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem provides a specific constraint derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state, assuming its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n*   Given: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0`: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This can be rearranged to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means that:\n    **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.** (C3)\n\nA reaction is \"not permitted\" if it violates at least one of these three conditions.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (3S1): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (p): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`.

Two nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions, so their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). It is impossible for two nucleons to form an `S=3` state. Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state cannot exist. However, let's check the given selection rules for completeness.\n*   Particle X (p): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check Conditions:\n    *   C1: `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`.

Reaction D is the one that is disallowed specifically by these rules. Reaction C is disallowed for a more fundamental reason (the composition of the NN system) that precedes the application of the reaction rules. Therefore, the most direct answer to the question as posed is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_initial + 1 = 1`  => `S_initial = 0` (Total spin of the two nucleons is 0, a singlet state).\n*   `L = S` => `L_initial = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons is 0).\n*   `J = 0` => `J_initial = 0` (Total angular momentum of the initial NN system).\n*   **Parity of the initial NN state (`P_initial_NN`)**: The parity of a two-particle system is given by `(-1)^L`. So, `P_initial_NN = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`. We need to check several rules for each proposed final state.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**: The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final state has isospin `T_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_final = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_final + L_final` must be an **odd number**. This is a critical selection rule for the final NN state.\n\n*   **Parity Conservation**: The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial_total = P_final_total`\n    *   `P_initial_total` is the parity of the initial `1S0` NN state, which is `+1`.\n    *   `P_final_total = P_final_NN * P_X * P_orbital`.\n        *   `P_final_NN = (-1)^L_final` (parity of the final NN internal state).\n        *   `P_X = -1` (intrinsic parity of particle X, given).\n        *   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the relative motion between X and the final NN system, where `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of X).\n    *   The conservation equation is: `+1 = ((-1)^L_final) * (-1) * ((-1)^l_X)`.\n    *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_final + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n*   **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial_total = J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the angular momenta in the final state: the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_final`) and the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   The total angular momentum of X is `j_X`, which is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`.\n    *   The conservation law is `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final) + vec(j_X)` or `0 = vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`.\n    *   This means the three vectors `vec(J_final)`, `vec(l_X)`, and `vec(s_X)` must form a closed triangle (their vector sum is zero). A consequence of this is the triangle inequality: `|J_final - l_X| <= s_X <= J_final + l_X`.\n    *   A common simplification occurs if particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), like a pion (`π`). In that case, `vec(J_final) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_final = l_X`. We will check this simpler case first, but the general case allows for a range of `s_X`.\n\n*   **Fundamental Constraints on NN states**: A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet, `2S+1=1`) or `S=1` (triplet, `2S+1=3`). Any other value of S is impossible.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these rules. The final state is `(2S+1)L(J) + l_X`.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=2`, `J_final=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is a valid spin for an NN system.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=3`, `l_X=3`. We need `|3 - 3| <= s_X <= 3 + 3`, so `0 <= s_X <= 6`. This is possible if X has spin `s_X` in this range (e.g., `s_X=0, 1, 2, ...`).\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S_final=3`. `L_final=2`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S_final=3` is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system. The maximum spin is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`.\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**. The final NN state is unphysical.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=0`, `J_final=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is valid.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=1`, `l_X=1`. We need `|1 - 1| <= s_X <= 1 + 1`, so `0 <= s_X <= 2`. This is possible if X has spin `s_X=0, 1, or 2`.\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_final=1`, `L_final=1`, `J_final=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   Check Rules:\n    1.  **NN State Validity**: `S=1` is valid.\n    2.  **Pauli (`S_f+L_f` odd)**: `1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_final+L_final` must be odd for `T_final=0`.\n    3.  **Parity (`L_f+l_X` odd)**: `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n    4.  **Ang. Mom.**: `J_final=0`, `l_X=0`. We need `|0 - 0| <= s_X <= 0 + 0`, so `s_X = 0`. This is only possible if particle X has spin 0.\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**. This violates the generalized Pauli principle as specified in the problem.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" reactions: B and D.\n*   **B is not permitted** because the proposed final state (`7D1`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   **D is not permitted** because it violates the specific selection rule (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`) that the problem instructed us to use for a `T_final=0` state.\n\nSince the problem explicitly provides the Pauli statistics rule and the condition `T(NN)=0`, it is highly probable that the question is designed to test the application of this specific rule. Option D is the one that fails this test. While option B is also impossible, it's due to a more fundamental property of nucleons not explicitly mentioned in the problem prompt. The key violation in D relates directly to the information provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0` (singlet state).\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of a system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State\nThe final state consists of the NN system and an emitted particle X.\n`NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system is `l_X`, denoted by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   Unless specified otherwise, we can assume particle X is spinless (`s_X = 0`), so its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Its quantum numbers are denoted `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n    *   We are given that its total isospin is `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for each potential reaction:\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum (`j_X`).\n*   `J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\n*   Since `J_i = 0`, `J_f` and `j_X` must be coupled to zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   Assuming `s_X = 0`, we have `j_X = l_X`. So, the condition simplifies to **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital parity: `P_f(total) = P_f(NN) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n*   `P(orbital)` is the parity associated with the relative orbital motion of the final particles, which is `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f(total) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   The conservation law is `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be even: `L_f + l_X + 1 = 2n`.\n*   This simplifies to the condition that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states a specific requirement for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are given `T_f = 0`.\n*   So, `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   For this equation to hold, `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n*   This means **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f = 3` (from `2S+1=7`), `L_f = 2` (D), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`.

(Note: A `7D1` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, but it passes the specific rules we were asked to check.)\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   1.  `J_f = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **(✗ This is an even number, which violates the condition.)**\n*   This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe reaction `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden transition.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Reaction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is 'S' => Total initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is '0' => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity of the NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The system emits a particle X. The reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of X is denoted by `l_X` (where s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n    *   We assume particle X is a meson (like a pion), which has intrinsic spin `s_X = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A final NN state described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and particle X.\n    *   The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 2. Establish the Conservation Laws and Selection Rules\n\nWe must check three conditions for the transition to be permitted:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   Since we assume `s_X=0`, `j_X = l_X`.\n*   So, `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\n*   For `J_i = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\n*   The final parity is `P_f = P_f(NN) * P_intrinsic(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n*   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n*   `P_intrinsic(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^(l_X)`.\n*   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved, `P_i = P_f`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n*   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:**\n*   The problem provides the rule for the final NN state: `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means `T_f` and `S_f + L_f + 1` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n*   The problem states that we must suppose `T_f = 0` (even).\n*   Therefore, `S_f + L_f + 1` must also be even.\n*   For `S_f + L_f + 1` to be even, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now check each proposed transition against these three rules. A transition is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n*   *Note*: A two-nucleon system cannot have `S=3`. However, we will check against the rules provided in the problem statement.\n*   **Rule (a) J-conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied. (Pass)\n*   **Rule (b) P-conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). (Pass)\n*   **Rule (c) Pauli principle:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). (Pass)\n*   According to the rules derived from the problem, this transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2` (D-wave), `J_f = 3`.\n*   Emitted particle `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule (a) J-conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X` is satisfied.

(Pass)\n*   **Rule (c) Pauli principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(Fail)**\n*   This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates the selection rules derived from the problem statement, specifically the Pauli exclusion principle for a final state with `T_f=0`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` (for L) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity of the initial state:** The parity of an NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin of the initial state:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the rule that the sum of isospin (T), spin (S), and orbital angular momentum (L) must be an odd integer: `L + S + T = odd`.\n    *   For the initial state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i = odd`, which means the initial isospin must be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws and Rules for the Decay\n\nThe decay process is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given several rules to check if a decay is permitted.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter: `s` (`l_X=0`), `p` (`l_X=1`), `d` (`l_X=2`), `f` (`l_X=3`).\n    *   The spin of particle X (`s_X`) is not given. We will assume it's a spin-0 particle, which is common in such problems (e.g., a pion). This is a reasonable assumption that simplifies the angular momentum conservation.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states the final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    *   The problem explicitly states: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Rearranging this gives `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 (mod 2)`, which means the sum `T_f + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    *   Since we are given `T_f = 0`, this simplifies to the condition that **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(orbital) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number.\n    *   This implies that **`L_f + l_X` must be an odd number**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    *   Total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n    *   Assuming particle X has spin `s_X = 0`, its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is `\\vec{J}_{f,tot} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{l_X}`.\n    *   For this to equal zero, the vectors `\\vec{J_f}` and `\\vec{l_X}` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   Therefore, the condition is **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). -> **FAIL**. The sum must be odd.\n*   Since this decay violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state (which is given as a mandatory condition), this partial wave is not permitted. We can stop here, but let's check the other rules for completeness.\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is forbidden due to the violation of the Pauli principle.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   This option describes a final NN state `7D1`. The `7` means `2S+1=7`, which implies `S_f=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. Therefore, this state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   However, if we mechanically apply the rules given in the problem:\n    *   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n    *   Particle X state `p`: `l_X = 1`.\n    1.  **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). -> **OK**\n    2.  **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). -> **OK**\n    3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. -> **OK**\n*   This decay passes all the checks given in the problem. The issue is with the physical existence of the state, not the process itself according to the given rules. Option B is the only one that fails a rule explicitly provided for checking the process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe partial wave described in option B, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`, is not permitted because the final two-nucleon state `3P0` with isospin `T=0` violates the generalized Pauli exclusion principle (`S_f + L_f` is even, not odd). This directly contradicts one of the conditions specified in the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system (`NN_i`).\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0` (total spin).\n*   `L` is 'S', which means `L_i = 0` (total orbital angular momentum).\n*   `J` is 0, so `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum).\n\nWe also need the initial isospin, `T_i`. The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical fermions (like two nucleons) states that the total wavefunction `Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial * Ψ_spin * Ψ_isospin` must be antisymmetric upon exchange of the two particles.\n*   The symmetry of the spatial part is `(-1)^L`. For `L_i = 0`, it's symmetric.\n*   The symmetry of the spin part for two spin-1/2 particles is symmetric for `S=1` (triplet) and antisymmetric for `S=0` (singlet). For `S_i = 0`, it's antisymmetric.\n*   The symmetry of the isospin part is symmetric for `T=1` (triplet) and antisymmetric for `T=0` (singlet).\n*   For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric: `(symmetric)_spatial * (antisymmetric)_spin * (Ψ_isospin)` must be antisymmetric. This requires `Ψ_isospin` to be symmetric, which corresponds to `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `1S0` with `J_i=0`, Parity `P_i = +1`, and `T_i = 1`.\n\nThe problem provides a formula which is a consequence of this principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `L+S+T` being an odd integer. For the initial state `1S0`: `L_i=0, S_i=0`, so `0+0+T_i` must be odd, which confirms `T_i` must be odd (`T_i=1`).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe process is `NN_i -> NN_f + X`.\n*   `NN_f` is the final two-nucleon state, given in each option. We are told `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (`s` for 0, `p` for 1, etc.).\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**I. Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem states `T(NN)_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven `T(NN)_f = 0`, we have `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\nTherefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is our first selection rule.\n\n**II. Parity Conservation:**\n`P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_initial = P(NN_i) = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`. (We can ignore the intrinsic parities of the nucleons as they appear on both sides).\n*   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_X = ((-1)^{L_f}) * (P_X_intrinsic * (-1)^{l_X})`.\n*   Given `P_X_intrinsic = -1`, we have `P_final = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n*   So, `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n*   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`.\n*   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number. This is our second selection rule.\n\n**III. Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n`J_i = J_f + j_X` (vector sum), where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n*   `J_i = 0`. This implies `J_f` and `j_X` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`J_f = j_X`).\n*   The total angular momentum of X is `j_X = l_X + s_X` (vector sum), where `s_X` is the spin of X.\n*   Let's check isospin conservation: `T_i = T_f + t_X` (vector sum). `1 = 0 + t_X`, so `t_X=1`. Particle X must have isospin 1. The lightest such particles are pions, which are pseudoscalar bosons (`P=-1, s_X=0`). Assuming X is a pion-like particle, its spin is `s_X=0`.\n*   If `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l_X`. The conservation law becomes `J_f = l_X`. This is our third selection rule.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against the three derived selection rules:\n1.  `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  `J_f = l_X`.\n\n| Option | Final State `NN_f`: `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` | Particle `X`: `l_X` | Rule 1: `S_f+L_f`=odd? | Rule 2: `L_f+l_X`=odd? | Rule 3: `J_f=l_X`? | Permitted? |\n|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| A) | `1S0 -> 3S1 + p` | `S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0+1=1` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | **Permitted** |\n| B) | `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` | `S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0` | `l_X=0` | `1+1=2` (No) | `1+0=1` (Yes) | `0=0` (Yes) | **Not Permitted** |\n| C) | `1S0 -> 3D3 + f` | `S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3` | `l_X=3` | `1+2=3` (Yes) | `2+3=5` (Yes) | `3=3` (Yes) | **Permitted** |\n| D) | `1S0 -> 7D1 + p` | `S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1` | `l_X=1` | `3+2=5` (Yes) | `2+1=3` (Yes) | `1=1` (Yes) | **Not Permitted** |\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   Options A and C satisfy all three selection rules and are therefore permitted transitions.\n*   Option B violates Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` must be odd, but `1+1=2` is even). This rule stems directly from the Pauli principle as applied to the final `T_f=0` state. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n*   Option D appears to satisfy all three selection rules. However, the final state `7D1` requires the two-nucleon system to have a total spin of `S_f=3` (since `2S_f+1=7`). A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. A spin of `S=3` is impossible. Thus, the final state is unphysical, and the reaction is forbidden for this fundamental reason.\n\nWe have two forbidden transitions, B and D. However, the question asks us to use the Pauli statistics and conservation laws. The transition in B is forbidden specifically by the Pauli principle requirement. The issue with D is the impossibility of the state itself, which is a piece of external knowledge not derived from the conservation laws of the reaction. In such problems, the violation of a specific rule given or implied in the problem statement is typically the intended answer. Option B is the only one that violates the selection rules governing the process.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThis problem requires us to check which of the proposed nuclear decay processes is forbidden. We need to check each option against the principles of conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle as applied to the final two-nucleon (NN) state.\n\n### 1. Initial State Analysis\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\nThe term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n-   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` => `S(initial) = 0`.\n-   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The 'S' in `1S0` means `L(initial) = 0`.\n-   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The '0' in `1S0` means `J(initial) = 0`.\n-   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe decay is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\nWe are given that particle X has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f...) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system. We will assume particle X is spinless (like a pion, a common scenario), so its total angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum, `J(NN_final)`, and the particle X's angular momentum, `l_X`. To conserve `J`, the vector sum must be zero. This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal:\n`J(NN_final) = l_X`.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\nThe initial parity is `P(initial) = +1`.\nThe final parity is `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n-   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L(NN_final)`\n-   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n-   `P(orbital) = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the relative motion between X and NN_final)\nSo, `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`.\nFor parity to be conserved, `P(initial) = P(final)`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`.\nThis simplifies to `-1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`, which means the exponent must be odd:\n`L(NN_final) + l_X = odd`.\n\n**c) Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nWe are given that the final state has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\nSubstituting this into the rule:\n`0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis means that the expression `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1` must be an even number. For this to be true, the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an odd number:\n`S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) = odd`.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\nLet's check each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`. `L=D` -> `L=2`. `J=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*However, a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin S=3. Two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form S=0 or S=1. So, the state `7D1` is unphysical for an NN system. This reaction is not permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n-   Final NN state (`3D3`): `2S+1=3` -> `S=1`. `L=D` -> `L=2`. `J=3`.\n-   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*This reaction is permitted.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n-   Final NN state (`3P0`): `2S+1=3` -> `S=1`. `L=P` -> `L=1`. `J=0`.\n-   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S+L` must be odd for `T=0`.\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*This reaction is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle constraint.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n-   Final NN state (`3S1`): `2S+1=3` -> `S=1`. `L=S` -> `L=0`. `J=1`.\n-   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Check:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK.**\n*This reaction is permitted.*\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have found two \"not permitted\" reactions:\n-   **A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`:** This is forbidden because the final `7D1` state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n-   **C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`:** This is forbidden because it violates a selection rule derived from the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state.\n\nIn physics problems of this nature, you are typically expected to apply the given conservation laws and selection rules to the states as written. A violation of a selection rule (as in C) is a more direct answer to the question about a forbidden transition than a state that is likely a typo but otherwise satisfies the transition rules (as in A). The core of the question tests your ability to apply the rules of the process. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that fails the selection rule check.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   **System:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN).\n*   **State:** 1S0. We use the term symbol notation (2S+1)L(J).\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` is the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `L_i = 0`, so the initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe decay process is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The lowercase letters (s, p, f) denote its orbital angular momentum, `l_X`. So, `s` means `l_X=0`, `p` means `l_X=1`, `f` means `l_X=3`. We assume particle X has no spin (`s_X=0`), as is common for particles like pions, which have `P=-1`.\n*   **Final NN State:** Has a given term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and a specified total isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check three conditions for each proposed decay:\n\n**Condition 1: Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is a formulation of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for nucleons, which requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric.\nGiven that the final state has `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which implies that the sum `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**. Any final NN state with `T_f=0` that does not satisfy this condition is forbidden.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be the same before and after the decay.\n`P(initial) = P(final)`\n`P(NN, initial) = P(NN, final) * P(X) * P(relative)`\nThe parity of relative motion between NN(final) and X is `(-1)^l_X`.\n`(-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\nSince `L_i = 0`:\n`+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`\n`+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\n`-1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\nThis requires that the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n**Condition 3: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be the same before and after the decay.\n`J_i = J_{total, f}`\n`J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n`J_{total, f} = J_f + j_X` (vector sum).\nAssuming particle X is spinless (`s_X=0`), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum (`j_X = l_X`).\nThe conservation law becomes `J_i = J_f + l_X` (vector sum).\nFor `J_i=0`, the triangle inequality `|J_f - l_X| <= 0 <= J_f + l_X` can only be satisfied if `J_f = l_X`.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. A transition is not permitted if it fails any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is 3P0: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X is in an `s`-wave: `l_X=0`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. The condition requires this sum to be odd.\n    *   This transition is **forbidden** because the final NN state (3P0 with T=0) violates the Pauli principle.\n\nLet's check the other rules for completeness.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** We need `J_f = l_X`. Here, `0 = 0`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** The process is forbidden due to the violation of the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   The term `7D1` implies `2S+1=7`, so `S=3`. This is impossible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only form total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. Assuming this is a typo and should be **3D1**.\n*   Final NN state is 3D1: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Parity Check:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). This is satisfied.\n*   **Ang. Momentum Check:** We need `J_f = l_X`. Here, `1 = 1`. This is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** Permitted (assuming 3D1).\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is 3S1: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X=1`.\n*   **Pauli Check:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd).

It fails because the proposed final state for the two nucleons (`3P0` with `T=0`) is forbidden by the generalized Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial system is a bound state of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic S) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J(NN)_initial = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n*   `P(NN)_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n`NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X**: It has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum state is denoted by a lowercase letter (s, p, d, f...), which corresponds to `L(X) = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`. We assume X is a spin-0 particle, as is common in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Final NN state**: The problem states `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Rules\nA valid transition must satisfy several conditions:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    `J_initial = J_final`\n    `J(NN)_initial` is 0. The final angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum `J(NN)_final` and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum `L(X)`.\n    So, `vec(J(NN)_final) + vec(L(X)) = vec(J_initial) = 0`.\n    This vector equation implies that `vec(J(NN)_final)` and `vec(L(X))` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    Therefore, we must have `J(NN)_final = L(X)`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `P_initial = P(NN)_initial = +1`.\n    `P_final = P(NN)_final * P(X)_intrinsic * P(X)_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN)_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final)`\n    *   `P(X)_intrinsic = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(X)_orbital = (-1)^(L(X))`.\n    The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN)_final) * (-1) * (-1)^(L(X))`.\n    This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN)_final + L(X))`.\n    For this to be true, `(-1)^(L(NN)_final + L(X))` must be `-1`.\n    This means the exponent `L(NN)_final + L(X)` must be odd.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Principle for Final State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Since we are given `T(NN)_final = 0`, the equation becomes:\n    `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1` must be an even number.\n    Therefore, `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Fundamental Properties of the NN System**\n    A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). This means `2S+1` can only be 1 or 3. Also, for a given `L` and `S`, the total angular momentum `J` must be in the range `|L-S| <= J <= L+S`.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\nWe will check each option against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. `3 = 3`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=1` is OK. For `L=2, S=1`, `J` can be 1, 2, 3. `J=3` is valid. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1 = 7` means `S=3`. `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. `1 = 1`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=3` is not possible for a two-nucleon system. **NOT PERMITTED**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because the final NN state is unphysical.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. `0 = 0`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This violates the requirement that `S+L` be odd for `T=0`. **NOT PERMITTED**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=1` is OK. For `L=1, S=1`, `J` can be 0, 1, 2. `J=0` is valid. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition for a T=0 final state.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. `1 = 1`. **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L(NN) + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n4.  **Valid State:** `S=1` is OK. For `L=0, S=1`, `J` can only be 1. `J=1` is valid. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nBoth options B and C describe non-permitted transitions.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons. This violates a fundamental principle of particle composition.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the final state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) has `S+L = 2` (even). According to the Pauli principle rule provided (`T = S+L+1 mod 2`), such a state must have isospin `T=1`. The problem stipulates that the final NN state must have `T=0`, creating a direct contradiction.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, we should prioritize rules explicitly given in the problem statement. The problem provides the conservation laws and the specific Pauli/isospin relationship as the framework for the solution. Option C violates the Pauli/isospin rule explicitly. The issue with option B relies on a fundamental principle (composition of nucleons) not explicitly stated as a rule to check. Therefore, the most direct violation of the problem's premises is in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` means the orbital angular momentum spectroscopic symbol is S, which corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` means the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial state `NN(1S0)` decays into a final state `NN_f` and a particle `X`.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `L_X`.\n        *   `s` => `L_X = 0`\n        *   `p` => `L_X = 1`\n        *   `f` => `L_X = 3`\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n    *   Let the final NN state have quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, and `J_f`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Rules to Apply\n\nWe need to check each potential reaction against three rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_{final}`\n    *   `P_i = +1`\n    *   `P_{final} = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^L_X`, where `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f` and `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L_f + L_X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + L_X) = -1`.\n    *   **Rule 1: `L_f + L_X` must be an odd number.**\n\n2.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = J_{total_final}`\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's orbital angular momentum (`L_X`). (Assuming particle X is spinless).\n    *   `J_{total_final} = J_f + L_X`.\n    *   For the vector sum to be zero (`J_f + L_X = 0`), the magnitudes of the two vectors must be equal.\n    *   **Rule 2: `J_f = L_X`**\n\n3.  **Pauli Statistics for Final State:** The problem explicitly gives a rule for the final NN state:\n    *   `T(NN)_f = S(NN)_f + L(NN)_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    *   Since `T(NN)_f = 0`, the rule becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   **Rule 3: `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\nNote on Rule 3: This rule is equivalent to the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, which states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, requiring `L+S+T` to be an odd number. For `T=0`, this means `L+S` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **Parity (`L_f + L_X` odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1`.

So, a state with `S=3` is physically impossible. This reaction is fundamentally forbidden. However, let's test it against the given rules as a matter of process.\n1.  **Parity (`L_f + L_X` odd?):** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = L_X`?):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` odd?):** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction satisfies all three rules given in the problem statement. It is only forbidden by the unstated, fundamental fact that two nucleons cannot form a spin `S=3` state.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth B and D represent forbidden reactions. However, reaction B is the only one that violates a rule explicitly provided and defined within the problem statement (the Pauli statistics requirement for the final T=0 state). Reaction D is forbidden for reasons external to the explicit rules given to check. In the context of a physics problem, you are expected to apply the given constraints. Therefore, B is the intended answer as it fails the explicit test.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1.

Option A is the only choice that fails one of the three explicitly required checks (Angular Momentum, Parity, Pauli).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers:\n- `2S+1 = 1` => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n- `L` is `S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n- `J` is `0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n- `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\nThe problem also mentions the Pauli principle for two-nucleon states: `T + S + L` must be odd.\nFor the initial `1S0` state, `S_i=0` and `L_i=0`. For `T_i + 0 + 0` to be odd, the isospin of the initial state must be `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Decay Process\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n- Particle X has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n- The final NN state is given to have isospin `T_f = 0`.\n- The lowercase letter `s, p, d, f` denotes the orbital angular momentum of the particle X relative to the final NN system. Let's call this `L_X`.\n    - `s`: `L_X = 0`\n    - `p`: `L_X = 1`\n    - `d`: `L_X = 2`\n    - `f`: `L_X = 3`\n- We assume the emitted particle X has no intrinsic spin (`s_X = 0`), which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. Its total angular momentum is therefore `j_X = L_X`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Conservation Laws and Rules\nTo determine if a transition is permitted, we must check it against conservation laws and given selection rules.\n\n**Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n- `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) = vec(J_f_NN) + vec(j_X)`\n- Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f_NN) + vec(j_X) = 0`.\n- This implies the vectors must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, `J_f_NN = j_X`.\n- With our assumption `s_X = 0`, this becomes `J_f_NN = L_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n- `P_i = P_f = P_f_NN * P_X_intrinsic * P_X_orbital`\n- The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum `L` is `(-1)^L`.\n- `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n- `P_f_NN = (-1)^L_f_NN`.\n- `P_X_intrinsic = -1` (given).\n- `P_X_orbital = (-1)^L_X`.\n- So, `+1 = (-1)^L_f_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X`.\n- `+1 = (-1)^(L_f_NN + L_X + 1)`.\n- This requires the exponent `L_f_NN + L_X + 1` to be an even number.\n- Therefore, `L_f_NN + L_X` must be an odd number.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states a rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt is also given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n- Plugging `T_f = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f_NN + L_f_NN + 1 (mod 2)`.\n- This means `S_f_NN + L_f_NN + 1` must be an even number.\n- Therefore, `S_f_NN + L_f_NN` must be an odd number.\n\nA transition is not permitted if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against the three rules we've established.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n- Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n- Particle X state `f`: `L_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `3 = 3`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n- This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n- Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` => `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n- According to the three transition rules, this transition is **permitted**. (Note: A two-nucleon system cannot have S=3. This makes the final state physically impossible. However, the question asks to check the properties of the transition (partial wave), and the transition itself satisfies all the given rules. In such cases, one must focus on violations of the stated rules for the process.)\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n- Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n- Particle X state `p`: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n- This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n- Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n- Particle X state `s`: `L_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = L_X`? => `0 = 0`. (✓)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L_f + L_X` is odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  **Pauli Rule:** `S_f + L_f` is odd? => `1 + 1 = 2`. (✗)\n- The sum `S_f + L_f` is even, but the rule for a `T_f=0` final state requires it to be odd. This transition violates the Pauli statistics rule given in the problem.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe transition described in option D, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`, is the only one that violates the selection rules provided in the problem statement. Specifically, it violates the Pauli principle requirement for the final two-nucleon state.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `1S0` means:\n    *   `2S+1 = 1`  =>  Total spin `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `S` (spectroscopic notation) => Orbital angular momentum `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n    *   `0` => Total angular momentum `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of the initial state is given by `P = P_intrinsic * (-1)^L`. For a two-nucleon system, the intrinsic parity `P_intrinsic = (+1) * (+1) = +1`. Thus, the initial parity is `P_initial = (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** According to the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`.\n    *   `0 + 0 + T(NN_initial)` must be odd, which implies `T(NN_initial) = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J=0`, `P=+1`, `T=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`. We are given several properties of the final state:\n*   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN(final)` has isospin `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n*   Let the quantum numbers of the final NN state be `S(NN_final)`, `L(NN_final)`, and `J(NN_final)`.\n*   Let the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle `X` be `l_X`. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe must apply three rules to check if a transition is permitted:\n\n**Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum `J(final) = J(NN_final) + l_X`.\n*   For `J(final)` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN_final) = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n*   `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n*   `P(initial) = +1`.\n*   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * (-1)^L(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   Substituting the known parities: `+1 = (+1) * (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   This simplifies to `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X) = -1`.\n*   Therefore, the sum `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an odd integer.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n*   The problem explicitly gives the condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final state has `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n*   Substituting `T=0`: `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds only if `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` is an odd integer.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the proposed transitions against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it fails any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `1 = 1`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X state (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `3 = 3`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X state (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `0 = 0`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. Even. **Fail.**\n*   Conclusion: **Not Permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X state (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (each with spin 1/2) cannot have a total spin of S=3. The maximum possible spin is S=1. Therefore, this final state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. However, the question asks to check the selection rules. We will proceed by mechanically applying the rules as instructed.\n*   **Rule 1 (J Cons):** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `1 = 1`. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity Cons):** `L+l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli):** `S+L` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. Odd. **Pass.**\n*   Conclusion: If we strictly follow the given rules, this transition is permitted. The issue lies in the physical existence of the final state, which is external to the selection rules being tested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, the transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates one of the explicit selection rules given in the problem (specifically, the Pauli statistics condition for the final T=0 state). Therefore, this is the partial wave that is not permitted.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_initial = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_initial = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum of the initial NN system is `J_initial = 0`.\n\nFrom these quantum numbers, we can determine the parity of the initial state:\n*   Parity is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n*   `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial `1S0` system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n*   **Final NN State**: Described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n*   **Particle X**: Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1` and is emitted in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` (`s`=0, `p`=1, `d`=2, `f`=3, etc.).\n\nWe must apply three main rules to check if a reaction is permitted:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state with isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`, the Pauli principle requires `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T(NN)_f = 0`, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This is true only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    `J_initial = J_final_total`\n    `J_initial` is the angular momentum of the initial NN state, which is `J_initial = 0`.\n    `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). (We assume particle X has no intrinsic spin, as is standard in such problems unless specified otherwise).\n    `J_final_total = J_f + l_X` (vector addition).\n    For the vector sum to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `|J_f - l_X| <= 0 <= J_f + l_X`, which implies `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `P_initial = +1`.\n    The final parity is the product of the parity of the final NN state, the intrinsic parity of particle X, and the parity from the orbital motion of particle X.\n    `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_X * P(orbital_X) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    So, the conservation equation is:\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be an even number, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3.

Option C is the only one that fails a direct check of the rules listed in the prompt (Pauli statistics, angular momentum, and parity conservation). The issue with option B is the composition of the state itself, a more fundamental fact but one that is external to the listed conservation laws to be checked. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that violates the specified reaction dynamics.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract its quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S=0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic S) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L=0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state (`NN'`) and a particle `X`.\n`1S0 -> NN' + X`\n\nThe final state consists of:\n*   The final two-nucleon state `NN'`, denoted by `(2S'+1)L'(J')`.\n*   The emitted particle `X`, which has an intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is in an orbital angular momentum state `l_X` relative to the `NN'` center of mass. The lowercase letters `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe must apply three conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**A. Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_initial = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_final` must also be 0.\n`J_final` is the vector sum of the `NN'` total angular momentum `J'` and the particle `X`'s total angular momentum `j_X`.\n`j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`. The problem does not specify the spin of particle X, so we can assume it's a pseudoscalar particle (like a pion) with `s_X = 0`.\nThus, `j_X = l_X`.\nThe conservation law is `J_initial = J_final`, so `vec{J_initial} = vec{J'} + vec{l_X}`.\nSince `J_initial = 0`, we have `0 = vec{J'} + vec{l_X}`, which implies `vec{J'} = -vec{l_X}`. For this to hold, their magnitudes must be equal:\n**Rule 1: `J' = l_X`**\n\n**B. Conservation of Parity:**\nThe initial parity is `P_initial = +1`. The final parity `P_final` must also be `+1`.\n`P_final = P(NN') * P(X) * P_orbital`\n*   `P(NN') = (-1)^L'`\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n*   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_X` (parity of the wavefunction for relative motion)\nSo, `P_final = (-1)^{L'} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^(L' + l_X + 1)`.\nFor parity to be conserved (`P_final = +1`), the exponent must be even:\n`L' + l_X + 1 = even`\nThis implies:\n**Rule 2: `L' + l_X = odd`**\n\n**C. Generalized Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\nFor any system of two identical fermions like nucleons (when treated in the isospin formalism), the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the requirement that the sum of their isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers must be odd:\n`T + S + L = odd`.\n\nThe problem specifies two conditions for the final `NN'` state:\n1.  The Pauli principle holds: `T' + S' + L' = odd`.\n2.  The isospin is `T' = 0`.\n\nSubstituting `T' = 0` into the Pauli rule gives:\n`0 + S' + L' = odd`.\n**Rule 3: `S' + L' = odd`**\n\n**D. Fundamental Constraint on Nucleon Spin:**\nA system of two nucleons (each spin-1/2) can only have a total spin `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). `2S+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n**Rule 4: `S'` must be 0 or 1.**\n\nAny permitted reaction must satisfy all these rules. We are looking for the one that is **not permitted**, meaning it violates at least one rule.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's test each option against the four rules derived above.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1` -> `2S'+1=7` means `S'=3`. `L'=D=2`. `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n*   Check Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=3`. This is **impossible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state: `3D3` -> `S'=1`, `L'=2`, `J'=3`.\n*   Particle X: `f`-wave -> `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=3`, `l_X=3`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 2+3=5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+2=3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state: `3S1` -> `S'=1`, `L'=0`, `J'=1`.\n*   Particle X: `p`-wave -> `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=1`, `l_X=1`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 0+1=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state: `3P0` -> `S'=1`, `L'=1`, `J'=0`.\n*   Particle X: `s`-wave -> `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J'=0`, `l_X=0`. `J'=l_X`. **OK.**\n*   Rule 2 (Parity): `L'+l_X = 1+0=1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S'+L' = 1+1=2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S'+L'` must be odd for a `T'=0` state.\n*   Rule 4 (Spin): `S'=1`. **OK.**\n*   This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle condition given the constraint `T'=0`.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and D are not permitted.\n*   **Transition A** is impossible because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) is not a valid two-nucleon state. This is a violation of the fundamental rules of adding angular momentum.\n*   **Transition D** is impossible because it violates the selection rule derived from the Pauli exclusion principle for a `T=0` final state, as `S'+L'=2` is even. This can also be seen as a fundamental contradiction: a `3P0` state must have `T=1` to satisfy `T+S+L=odd` (`T+1+1=odd`), which contradicts the problem's premise that the final state has `T=0`.\n\nThe question asks which partial wave is not permitted. Usually, such questions test the application of selection rules on transitions between valid states. The violation in option D is a direct contradiction of the premises explicitly stated in the problem (`T(NN)=0` and the Pauli statistics rule). The violation in option A is due to the non-existence of the state itself, a fact that is fundamental but not explicitly listed in the rules to \"make use of\". Given that the properties of state `3P0` (`S=1, L=1`) are in direct conflict with the condition `T=0` via the Pauli principle, this represents the most direct violation of the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, we select D as the answer. It is forbidden by the explicit rules that the problem requires us to use.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the quantum numbers from the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n\nWe can also determine the parity of the initial state. The parity of an NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n*   Parity of the initial state: `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State\n\nThe system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n`NN_i (1S0) -> NN_f + X`\n\n*   **Final NN state:** Described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The problem specifies that we should assume the isospin of this final state is `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and orbital angular momentum `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f... corresponding to `l_X` = 0, 1, 2, 3...).\n\n### 3. Establish the Rules for Allowed Transitions\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and principles. The problem directs us to use:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's orbital angular momentum (`l_X`).\n    *   `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(l_X)`\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, this implies `vec(J_f) + vec(l_X) = 0`. This can only be true if their magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f(total)`\n    *   `P_f(total) = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^{l_X}`, where `P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}` and `(-1)^{l_X}` is the parity of the relative motion between `NN_f` and `X`.\n    *   Substituting the known values: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1) * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`, which means `(-1)^{L_f + l_X}` must be `-1`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:** The problem explicitly provides the condition for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are told to assume `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   So, `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n4.  **Fundamental Properties of the NN System:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Any state with a different total spin is unphysical.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the given options against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` state): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = l_X`?):** `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` = odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` = odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **(Fail)**\n4.  **NN Properties (`S_f` <= 1?):** `S_f=1`. (Pass)\n\nThis transition is forbidden because it violates the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` state): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = l_X`?):** `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` = odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` = odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (Pass)\n4.  **NN Properties (`S_f` <= 1?):** `S_f=1`. (Pass)\n\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` = odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` = odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n4.  **NN Properties (`S_f` <= 1?):** `S_f=1`. (Pass)\n\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` state): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Ang. Mom. (`J_f = l_X`?):** `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` = odd?):** `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` = odd?):** `3 + 2 = 5`. (Pass)\n4.  **NN Properties (`S_f` <= 1?):** `S_f=3`. **(Fail)**\n\nThis transition is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and D are forbidden. However, transition A fails the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem statement for the assumed final state. Transition D fails a more fundamental property of the NN system (the maximum possible spin) that was not explicitly mentioned in the prompt. In the context of such problems, one is typically expected to find the violation of the explicitly stated rules. Transition A is the only one that violates the Pauli rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)` for `T=0`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the System and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S+1 = 1` -> Total Spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` -> Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` -> Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The generalized Pauli principle states that for a two-nucleon system, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer, where T is the isospin. For the initial state, `L_i=0, S_i=0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies the initial isospin is `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **Process:** The initial NN system emits a particle X and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   Particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. We will assume particle X is spinless (spin `s_X = 0`), which is typical for such problems unless stated otherwise (e.g., a pion). The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f...`) denotes the orbital angular momentum of X, `l_X`, relative to the final NN system.\n\n*   **Final State:** The final state consists of the `NN(final)` system and particle X.\n    *   The final NN state has a specified isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   The properties of the final NN state are given by its term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   The particle X is in an orbital state `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three main rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum `J_f(NN)` and the angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`.\n    *   Assuming X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X`. So, `J_f` is the vector sum of `J_f(NN)` and `l_X`.\n    *   For `J_f` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f(NN) = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the final NN system's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of X's orbital motion.\n    *   `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^(l_X)`.\n    *   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^(L_f)`. `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `P_f = P_i = +1`. This means the exponent must be even: `L_f + l_X + 1 = even`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `L_f + l_X = odd`.\n\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states that `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.\n    *   (This rule is a consequence of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons, which requires `L+S+T` to be odd).\n\n4.  **State Validity:** The proposed final NN state `(2S+1)L(J)` must be physically possible for two nucleons. This means S can only be 0 or 1, and J must be a valid result of the vector addition of L and S.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against these four conditions. A reaction is \"not permitted\" if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X in a `p` state: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n4.  **State Validity:** S=1 is possible. L=0, S=1 -> J=1 is possible. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X in an `s` state: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATION.**\n4.  **State Validity:** S=1 is possible. L=1, S=1 -> J=0 is possible. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X in an `f` state: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. `J_f = l_X`. **OK.**\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n4.  **State Validity:** S=1 is possible. L=2, S=1 -> J=3 is possible. **OK.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X in a `p` state: `l_X=1`.\n4.  **State Validity:** A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). `S=3` is impossible. **VIOLATION.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because the proposed final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nWe have found two non-permitted reactions: B and D.\n*   Reaction B is forbidden because the final `NN` state (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the generalized Pauli principle, a rule explicitly highlighted in the question.\n*   Reaction D is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed `NN` state (`7D1`) cannot exist because two nucleons cannot form a spin S=3 state.\n\nIn the context of such physics problems, when one option (B) violates a dynamical rule you are explicitly asked to check (the Pauli rule relating L, S, and T), while another option (D) violates a compositional rule (how states are formed), the intended answer is typically the one that fails the specific analysis requested. Option B fails the parity rule `S_f + L_f = odd`. The other options, including D, formally satisfy all three conservation/Pauli rules if we hypothetically allow the `S=3` state to exist. Therefore, B is the most direct answer based on the problem's instructions.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (`NN_initial`):** A two-nucleon system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n    *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since 2*0 + 1 = 1)\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter S)\n    *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0`\n    *   Parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Emitted Particle (X):**\n    *   Intrinsic Parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the `NN` system is `l_X`. The notation `s, p, d, f` corresponds to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   We assume the intrinsic spin of particle X is `s_X = 0`, as is common unless stated otherwise. Its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n\n*   **Final State (`NN_final`):**\n    *   A two-nucleon system in a state described by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   Parity of this state is `P_f = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   The problem states the isospin of this final state is `T_f = 0`.\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**Conservation Laws & Principles:**\n\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    `J_i = J_final`\n    The initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the `NN_final` system's angular momentum `J_f` and the particle X's angular momentum `j_X`.\n    `vec(J_final) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`.\n    For `J_final` to be 0, `vec(J_f)` and `vec(j_X)` must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Thus, we need `J_f = j_X`. Assuming `s_X = 0`, this simplifies to `J_f = l_X`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    `P_initial = P_final`\n    `P_i = P_f * P_X * (-1)^l_X` (The final parity is the product of the final `NN` system's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity from the orbital motion of X).\n    `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n    This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` is an even number. This implies that `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final `NN` state, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Given `T_f = 0`, the condition becomes:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n    (This also implies that the final NN state must be physically possible for two nucleons, meaning `S_f` can only be 0 or 1).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Check:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). `S_f=3` is impossible.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because the final `NN` state is physically impossible.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (Satisfied)\n    2.  `L_f + l_X` = odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (Satisfied)\n    3.  `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (Satisfied)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (Satisfied)\n    2.  `L_f + l_X` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n    3.  `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. **(VIOLATED)**. The sum is even.\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final state.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n    2.  `L_f + l_X` = odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n    3.  `S_f + L_f` = odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Satisfied)\n*   **Conclusion:** This reaction is permitted.\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nBoth options A and C describe forbidden reactions.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the final `NN` state `7D1` requires a total spin of S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons.\n*   Option C is forbidden because, for the given final state `3P0` with `T_f=0`, it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\nThe question explicitly asks the solver to use the conservation laws and the provided Pauli statistics rule. Option C is the reaction that is forbidden by a direct application of this Pauli rule. Option A is forbidden for a more fundamental reason (the constituents of the system) that precedes the application of the specific reaction rules. In the context of such a physics problem, the intended answer is the one that directly tests the principles mentioned in the question.\n\nTherefore, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the forbidden partial wave based on the rules to be applied.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can decode `1S0`:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  =>  Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L = S`  =>  Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J = 0`  =>  Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Initial Parity:** The parity of a two-particle system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n        *   `P_i = (-1)^(L_i) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Process:** The initial NN system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n    *   `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l_X` (denoted by s, p, d, f...).\n    *   We assume particle X is a spin-0 meson (like a pion), which is standard for such problems unless specified otherwise. This means its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum, `j_X = l_X`.\n\n*   **Final NN State:**\n    *   Let the quantum numbers be `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`.\n    *   It is specified that the final state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe need to check each proposed reaction against a set of rules. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of these rules.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Principle (as given in the prompt)**\n    *   The prompt states: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds true only if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P_final(NN) * P_orbital(X) * P_intrinsic(X)`.\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1)^(l_X) * (-1) = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final)`\n    *   `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0` and we assume `j_X = l_X` (for a spin-0 particle X), we get `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `vec(J_f) = -vec(l_X)`, meaning their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Triangle Inequality for Angular Momentum**\n    *   The quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f` for the final NN state must be self-consistent. The total angular momentum `J_f` must be a possible result of vectorially adding `L_f` and `S_f`.\n    *   This means `|L_f - S_f| <= J_f <= L_f + S_f`.\n\n*   **Note on an additional potential rule:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). The `7D1` state in option A has `2S+1=7`, meaning `S=3`, which is physically impossible for two nucleons. While this renders option A impossible, option D violates a rule explicitly provided and constructed within the problem statement. In such cases, the intended answer is typically the one that fails the explicitly provided rules. We will see that D fails one of the main rules derived above.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against the four rules derived above.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f = 3`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|2 - 3| <= 1 <= 2 + 3`? Yes, `1 <= 1 <= 5`. **OK.**\n    *(This transition passes all checks derived from conservation laws and the provided Pauli rule, but is forbidden because S=3 is not possible for two nucleons.)*\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X is in an `f`-wave: `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `3 = 3`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|2 - 1| <= 3 <= 2 + 1`? Yes, `1 <= 3 <= 3`. **OK.**\n    *This transition is permitted.*\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X is in a `p`-wave: `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `1 = 1`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|0 - 1| <= 1 <= 0 + 1`? Yes, `1 <= 1 <= 1`. **OK.**\n    *This transition is permitted.*\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X is in an `s`-wave: `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **FAILS** the requirement that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f = 0`.\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity):** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK.**\n*   **Rule 3 (Ang. Mom.):** Is `J_f = l_X`? Yes, `0 = 0`. **OK.**\n*   **Rule 4 (Triangle Ineq.):** Is `|1 - 1| <= 0 <= 1 + 1`? Yes, `0 <= 0 <= 2`. **OK.**\n    *This transition is forbidden because it violates the Pauli Principle constraint for a final state with `T_f=0`.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and D are forbidden for different reasons. Transition A is forbidden because a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin S=3. Transition D is forbidden because a `3P0` state must have isospin T=1 according to the generalized Pauli principle, which contradicts the problem's condition that `T_f = 0`. This contradiction manifests as a failure of Rule 1 (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\nSince option D violates a condition explicitly constructed from the rules given in the problem prompt (`T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 mod 2` and `T(NN)=0`), it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers for the initial NN system.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   Initial parity `P_i` depends on the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Reaction:** `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   A particle `X` with intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` is emitted.\n    *   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the final NN system, which we'll call `l_x`.\n    *   s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.\n\n*   **Final State:** The final NN state `NN(final)` has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n\n**2. Identify the Governing Rules (Conservation Laws and Statistics)**\n\nWe need to check three conditions for any potential reaction to be allowed.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_x`). For the initial and final total angular momenta to be equal:\n    `J_i = J_f + l_x` (vector sum)\n    `0 = J_f + l_x`\n    This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_x`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity**\n    The total parity must be conserved. The initial parity is `P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given)\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_x`\n    So, the conservation equation is: `P_i = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`.\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`\n    For this to be true, the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` must be an even number. This implies that the sum `L_f + l_x` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n    The problem states that for the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    We are given that `T_f = 0`. Substituting this into the rule:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This simplifies to `S_f + L_f = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_f + L_f = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Therefore, the sum of the final spin and final orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be **odd**.\n\n**3. Test Each Option Against the Rules**\n\nWe will check each option to see if it violates any of these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n    *This transition appears allowed by the rules of the decay process. However, the state `7D1` requires `S=3`. A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system, making the transition forbidden.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_x=1`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n    *This transition is permitted by all rules.*\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_x=3`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n    *This transition is permitted by all rules.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_x=0`.\n1.  **J_f = l_x?** `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **L_f + l_x = odd?** `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **S_f + L_f = odd?** `1 + 1 = 2`. (VIOLATED)\n    *The sum `S_f + L_f` is even, which violates the Pauli statistics condition for the final state.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transition in option D) violates the Pauli statistics rule explicitly provided in the question for a final state with `T(NN)=0`. Although the final state in option A) is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons, option D) is the one that fails the specific calculation based on the given constraints of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L_J`:\n*   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies the total spin `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L` is 'S', which corresponds to orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J` is 0, so the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nFrom these quantum numbers, we can determine the parity and isospin of the initial state.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a system with orbital angular momentum `L` is `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin:** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical nucleons states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts.\n    *   Antisymmetry `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1` which implies `L+S+T` must be odd.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which means the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `J_i=0`, `P_i=+1`, `T_i=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system `(NN)_f` and an emitted particle `X`.\n*   **Particle X:** Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** Described by `(2S_f+1)L_f_{J_f}`. The problem specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\nWe must apply the following rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial total angular momentum `J_i=0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`. So, `vec(J_f) + vec(l_X) = 0`, which implies `J_f = l_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The initial parity `P_i=+1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN parity `P_f(NN) = (-1)^{L_f}`, the intrinsic parity of X `P(X)=-1`, and the orbital parity of X's motion `(-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   `P_f = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_f = P_i`), we must have `(-1)^{L_f+l_X+1} = +1`. This means `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even, or `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State:** The problem states the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n    *   Given `T_f(NN)=0`, the rule simplifies to `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n4.  **Validity of the Final State:** For a two-nucleon system, the total spin `S_f` can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). This means `2S_f+1` can only be 1 or 3.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will test each option against these four rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state: `7D1`. This means `2S_f+1=7`, so `S_f=3`.\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(Violation)**\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is not permitted.**\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Rule 1 (J cons.): `J_f = l_X` => `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 2 (P cons.): `L_f + l_X` = odd => `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Rule 3 (Pauli): `S_f + L_f` = odd => `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Rule 4 (Validity): `S_f=1`. (OK)\n*   **Conclusion: This transition is permitted.**\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   C is forbidden because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final state, which is a key selection rule mentioned explicitly in the problem.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, if a state is unphysical (like in A), it is often considered a typo. If we assume it was a typo for a valid state like `3D1`, the transition would be permitted (as `S=1, L=2, J=1; l_X=1` would satisfy all rules). The question prominently features the Pauli statistics requirement, suggesting that the test is focused on applying this specific rule. Option C is the only one that represents a transition to a physically possible state (`3P0` is valid) but is forbidden specifically by this Pauli principle selection rule. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's extract its quantum numbers. The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S=0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The spectroscopic notation 'S' corresponds to `L=0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J=0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The Pauli exclusion principle must apply to the two-nucleon system. The generalized Pauli principle states that the total wavefunction (spatial, spin, isospin) must be antisymmetric upon exchange of the two identical nucleons. This leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be odd, i.e., `L + S + T = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0` and `S=0`. So, `0 + 0 + T_initial = 1 (mod 2)`, which implies `T_initial = 1`.\n\nSo, the initial state is `1S0`: `J=0, P=+1, T=1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe initial system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n*   `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`\n\nWe are given several pieces of information and conservation laws must hold.\n\n*   **Particle X:** Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. Its orbital angular momentum with respect to the final NN system is `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, ...).\n*   **Final NN state:** Has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic)`\n    *   `P_final = (-1)^(L_final) * (-1)^(l_X) * (-1)`\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_final + l_X + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies `L_final + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum vector is conserved.\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final)`\n    *   `vec(J(NN_initial)) = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`, where `j_X` is the total angular momentum of particle X.\n    *   Since `J(NN_initial) = 0`, we have `0 = vec(J(NN_final)) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   This implies `J(NN_final) = j_X` in magnitude.\n    *   The total angular momentum of particle X is `vec(j_X) = vec(l_X) + vec(s_X)`, where `s_X` is the unknown spin of particle X. The magnitude `j_X` must satisfy the triangle inequality `|l_X - s_X| <= j_X <= l_X + s_X`.\n    *   A simple and common case in such problems is that X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion, which has `J^P=0-`). If `s_X=0`, then `j_X = l_X`, and the conservation law simplifies to `J(NN_final) = l_X`. We will use this simplified rule, as the result should be independent of the unknown spin `s_X`.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem gives a specific rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this into the rule gives `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This can be rewritten as `S_final + L_final = -1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to `S_final + L_final = 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   So, for the final NN state, the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, `S_final + L_final`, must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Test Each Proposed Transition\n\nLet's check each option against the rules we've established:\n1.  **Pauli Rule:** `S + L` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Rule:** `L + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum Rule (for `s_X=0`):** `J = l_X`.\n4.  **State Possibility:** We should also note whether the proposed final NN state is physically possible (e.g., `S=0` or `1` for two nucleons).\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **VIOLATED**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted due to violation of the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` => `S=3`. `L=2` ('D' state). `J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). An `S=3` state is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed.\n*   Conclusion: Not permitted because the final state is impossible.\n*(Note: If we ignored this impossibility and just applied the selection rules, we would find: Pauli: `S+L = 3+2=5` (odd) -> OK. Parity: `L+l_X = 2+1=3` (odd) -> OK. Ang. Mom.: `J=1, l_X=1` -> OK. This is why it's important to recognize unphysical states.)*\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J = l_X`. **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** violates the specific Pauli principle constraint given in the problem.\n*   **C)** involves a final state that is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this type, we are typically expected to find a unique answer by applying the principles mentioned in the problem statement. The question explicitly asks us to use \"Pauli statistics,\" \"conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\" Option B is the only one that fails the Pauli statistics rule as defined in the problem. The issue with option C is the impossibility of the state itself, which is a more fundamental error but might be considered outside the direct application of the specified conservation laws. Therefore, the intended answer is the one that violates the provided rules.\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because for the final NN state `3P0` (S=1, L=1) with T=0, the sum `S+L=2` is even, which violates the required condition that `S+L` must be odd.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe code execution has systematically evaluated each proposed reaction against the rules derived from the problem statement. Let's summarize the findings to select the final answer.\n\n### Summary of Rules\nA reaction `1S0 -> NN_f + X` is permitted only if all three conditions are met:\n1.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` must be an odd number.\n2.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the final nucleon pair, `J_f`, must equal the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n3.  **Pauli Constraint (for T_f=0):** The sum of the final nucleon pair's spin and orbital angular momentum, `S_f + L_f`, must be an odd number.\n\n### Analysis of Each Option based on Code Output\n\n*   **A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p:** The code shows that this reaction passes all three rules given in the problem. However, the `7D1` state implies a total spin `S=3` for the two-nucleon system, which is physically impossible as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to form `S=0` or `S=1`. So, while it passes the given checklist, it's forbidden on more fundamental grounds.\n*   **B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and describes a physically possible final state. It is a permitted transition.\n*   **C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s:** The code shows that this reaction violates **Rule 3**, the Pauli statistics constraint.\n    *   For the final state `3P0`, we have `S_f=1` and `L_f=1`.\n    *   The sum `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is an **even** number.\n    *   This violates the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd** for a final state with `T(NN)=0`.\n    *   Therefore, this partial wave is **not permitted**.\n*   **D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p:** The code confirms this reaction passes all three rules and is physically possible. It is a permitted transition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the partial wave that is **not permitted**. Option C is the only one that violates one of the explicit rules provided in the problem statement (the Pauli constraint). While option A is also forbidden, it's due to a reason outside the specified rules, making option C the most direct and intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` tells us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` means the initial orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` means the total initial angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Process:** The system emits a particle X, leading to a final state.\n    *   `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum `L(X)` is given by the lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n### 2. Identify the Relevant Conservation Laws and Principles\nThe problem requires us to use three key principles:\n\n**a) Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n*   The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n*   `J_i = J_f_total}`.\n*   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum `J_f_total}` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   So, `vec(J_f) + vec(j_X) = 0`. This implies their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n*   The problem does not specify the spin of particle X, `S(X)`. A standard assumption for emitted mesons (like pions) or in such problems when not specified is `S(X)=0`. If `S(X)=0`, then `j_X = L(X)`.\n*   Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum rule is: **`J_f = L(X)`**.\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity (P):**\n*   The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n*   The parity of a composite system is the product of the intrinsic parities of its components multiplied by `(-1)^L`, where L is the relative orbital angular momentum.\n*   **Initial Parity:** `P_i = P(NN_i) = P_n * P_p * (-1)^{L_i}`. Nucleons (protons 'p', neutrons 'n') have intrinsic parity `+1`. `L_i=0`. So, `P_i = (+1)(+1)(-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Final Parity:** `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^{L(X)}`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (+1)(+1)(-1)^{L_f} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L(X)} = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`.\n*   Conservation (`P_i = P_f`) means `+1 = -(-1)^{L_f + L(X)}`. This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_f + L(X)} = -1`.\n*   This implies the exponent must be odd. So, the rule is: **`L_f + L(X)` must be odd**.\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle for Nucleons:**\n*   The problem states: \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\".\n*   This is equivalent to the fundamental requirement that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric, which means `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n*   The problem then asks us to evaluate the options under the specific condition: **`T_f = 0`**.\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the Pauli rule `L_f+S_f+T_f` = odd, we get `L_f+S_f` = odd.\n*   So, for a transition to be allowed under the given condition, the final NN state must satisfy: **`L_f + S_f` must be odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe will now check each of the four options against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7 -> S_f=3`; `L_f=2` (D-wave); `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **State Validity:** Two nucleons are spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin can only be `S = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet). A state with `S_f = 3` (a septet) is impossible for a two-nucleon system. The state `7D1` does not exist for an NN system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `2S_f+1=3 -> S_f=1`; `L_f=1` (P-wave); `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 1 + 1 = 2`. Is this odd? No, it is even. (VIOLATION)\n*   Since this option violates the Pauli principle for `T_f=0`, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`; `L_f=0`; `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 0 + 1 = 1`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`; `L_f=2`; `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Check:**\n    1.  **J Conservation:** `J_f = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. Is `J_f = L(X)`? Yes. (OK)\n    2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n    3.  **Pauli Principle (T_f=0):** `L_f + S_f = 2 + 1 = 3`. Is this odd? Yes. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nWe have identified two forbidden transitions:\n*   **A) is forbidden** because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **B) is forbidden** because it violates the selection rule imposed by the Pauli principle under the problem's condition that `T_f = 0`. The `3P0` state requires `T_f=1`.\n\nIn multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must identify the single best answer. The question's structure explicitly provides the Pauli principle rule and asks to evaluate the options assuming `T_f = 0`. This directs the solver to test this specific condition. Option B is the only one that fails this test. The impossibility of state A is due to prior knowledge outside the specific rules laid out in the problem text for the test. The most direct contradiction of the problem's setup is found in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies `S(NN)_initial = 0` (total spin).\n*   The letter `S` denotes the orbital angular momentum, so `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum, `J(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^(L(NN)_initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   The Pauli exclusion principle for two nucleons (identical fermions) requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where T is the total isospin. For the initial state: `(-1)^(0+0+T) = -1`, which means `T(NN)_initial = 1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Final State**\n\nThe reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\n*   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to the final NN system is denoted by `l_X` (`s`=0, `p`=1, `d`=2, `f`=3, etc.).\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n\n**3. Establish the Conservation Laws and Constraints**\n\nWe need to check each option against a set of rules. A reaction is permitted only if it satisfies all of them.\n\n*   **Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum.**\n    The initial total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J(NN)_final`) and the relative orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to be conserved (`J_final = 0`), the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN)_final = l_X`.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Conservation of Parity.**\n    The initial parity is `P_initial = +1`. The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of X, and the parity of the relative motion: `P_final = P(NN)_final * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    `P(NN)_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final)`.\n    So, `P_final = (-1)^(L(NN)_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X)`.\n    For parity to be conserved (`P_initial = P_final`), we need `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X)`.\n    This implies `(-1)^(L(NN)_final + l_X) = -1`, which means `L(NN)_final + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State.**\n    The problem states that for `T(NN)_final = 0`, the quantum numbers must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    Substituting `T(NN)_final = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1` must be an even number, which in turn means `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Rule 4: Angular Momentum Coupling.**\n    For any state, the total angular momentum `J` must satisfy the triangle inequality with the orbital angular momentum `L` and spin `S`: `|L - S| <= J <= L + S`.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's check each proposed reaction against these four rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `2 + 1 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `3 + 2 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   Check 4 (|L-S|<=J<=L+S): `|2-3| <= 1 <= 2+3` => `1 <= 1 <= 5`. (Pass)\n*   *Note*: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) cannot have a total spin S=3. The only possibilities are S=0 or S=1. So this state is physically impossible. However, it passes the explicit rules given for the *reaction dynamics*.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X = 3`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `3 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `2 + 3 = 5`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. (Pass)\n*   Check 4 (|L-S|<=J<=L+S): `|2-1| <= 3 <= 2+1` => `1 <= 3 <= 3`. (Pass)\nThis reaction is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X = 0`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `0 = 0`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `1 + 1 = 2`. This is even. **(FAIL)**\n*   This reaction violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state as given in the problem.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X = 1`.\n*   Check 1 (J=l_X): `1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 2 (L+l_X odd): `0 + 1 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 3 (S+L odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (Pass)\n*   Check 4 (|L-S|<=J<=L+S): `|0-1| <= 1 <= 0+1` => `1 <= 1 <= 1`. (Pass)\nThis reaction is permitted.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction in option C is not permitted because it violates the Pauli statistics requirement for the final two-nucleon state (`S+L` must be odd for T=0, but here S+L=2 is even). This is a direct violation of one of the rules specified in the problem statement. While option A leads to a physically impossible state (`S=3`), it passes all the conservation and symmetry rules given to test the reaction dynamics. Therefore, C is the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\n*   **State:** The initial two-nucleon (NN) system is in a `1S0` state.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` => Total initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L` is `S` => Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J` is `0` => Total initial angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity:** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`.\n    *   Initial parity `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.\n\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` into the rule: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number (like 0, 2, 4...).\n    *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is a crucial test for the final NN state.\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `J_initial = J_final_total`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final_total` is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n    *   `vec(J_final_total) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`. For this sum to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal, `J_f = j_X`, and their vectors must be opposite.\n    *   Particle X has orbital angular momentum `l_X` (given by s, p, d, f...). The problem does not state its spin (`s_X`). In such problems, it is standard to assume the emitted particle is spinless (e.g., a pion), so `s_X = 0`.\n    *   If `s_X = 0`, then `j_X = l_X`. The condition simplifies to `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the system must be conserved.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final_total`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   `P_final_total = P_{NN,f} * P_X`.\n    *   `P_{NN,f} = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   The parity of particle X is `P_X = (P_intrinsic_X) * (-1)^{l_X}`. We are given that the intrinsic parity of X is -1.\n    *   `P_X = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{l_X + 1}`.\n    *   So, `P_final_total = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}`.\n    *   The conservation law `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + l_X + 1}` requires the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` to be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against these three rules:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum:** `J_f = l_X`.\n\n---\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` implies `S_f=3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0` (singlet) or `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1` (triplet).\n*   A total spin of `S_f=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system. The final state `7D1` is unphysical.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final NN state cannot exist.\n\n---\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n---\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). **This violates the Pauli principle requirement** for a final state with T=0.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J_f = l_X`. OK.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nWe have found two non-permitted transitions: B and D.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final NN state (`7D1`) is fundamentally impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Option D is forbidden because it violates the specific Pauli statistics rule provided in the problem for a final NN state with `T=0`. The state `3P0` itself is possible for two nucleons, but it must have `T=1` to satisfy the Pauli principle (`L+S+T=1+1+1=3` odd), not `T=0` as required by the problem.\n\nThe question explicitly asks the solver to use the Pauli statistics requirement. Option D fails this specific test. Option B fails on a more basic state-composition ground. In physics problems of this nature, one should prioritize the rules explicitly given. The transition in D satisfies conservation laws but fails the additional constraint imposed by the Pauli principle, which is what the question appears designed to test.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Reaction\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine the quantum numbers of the initial state:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  =>  `S_i = 0` (Total spin).\n        *   The letter `S` corresponds to `L_i = 0` (Total orbital angular momentum).\n        *   The subscript `0` means `J_i = 0` (Total angular momentum).\n    *   **Initial Parity:** The parity of the NN system is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`. So, `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle X, leading to a final state of the NN system plus particle X.\n    *   Reaction: `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   **Particle X:**\n        *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` (given).\n        *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`) denotes the orbital angular momentum, `l`, of the emitted particle X relative to the final NN system.\n            *   s: `l=0`\n            *   p: `l=1`\n            *   f: `l=3`\n    *   **Final NN State:**\n        *   This is given by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n        *   It is explicitly stated that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation Laws and Physical Principles\n\nWe must check each potential reaction against three main rules:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   `J_initial = J_final` (vector sum).\n    *   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J_f` and the total angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X is a spin-0 particle like a pion (which has intrinsic parity -1), its total angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum `l`.\n    *   So, `J_final = J_f + l` (vector sum).\n    *   For `J_initial = 0`, we must have `J_f + l = 0`. This is only possible if the vectors have equal magnitude and opposite direction. Thus, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l`.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = P(NN_i) = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^l`.\n    *   Setting `P_initial = P_final`:\n        `+1 = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^l`\n        `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L_f + l)`\n        `-1 = (-1)^(L_f + l)`\n    *   This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l` is an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Generalized Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    *   For a system of two identical fermions like nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   The problem states this in an equivalent form: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has `T_f(NN) = 0`. Plugging this into the rule:\n        `L_f + S_f + T_f = L_f + S_f + 0` must be odd.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + S_f` must be an **odd** number for the final NN state.\n\n### 3.

Understand the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_initial = 0`. This is the singlet state.\n*   `L = S` means the orbital angular momentum is `L_initial = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` means the total angular momentum is `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is `P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nWe need to check each proposed transition against several rules for it to be permitted.\n\n**Rule 1: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum of the system must be conserved.\n*   `J_initial = 0`.\n*   The final state consists of the NN system and particle X. The total final angular momentum `J_final(total)` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_final`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`j_X`).\n*   So, `J_final` and `j_X` must be able to couple to `J_initial = 0`. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: `J_final = j_X`.\n*   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the *orbital* angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). If we assume particle X has no intrinsic spin (`s_X=0`), then `j_X = l_X`.\n*   Thus, the conservation of angular momentum requires `J_final = l_X`.\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the system must be conserved.\n*   `P_initial = +1`.\n*   The final parity `P_final` is the product of the parities of the final NN state, particle X, and their relative orbital motion.\n*   `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_final`.\n*   The problem states particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_final * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_final + l_X)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved, `P_initial = P_final`, so `+1 = -(-1)^(L_final + l_X)`.\n*   This simplifies to `(-1)^(L_final + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_final + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**Rule 3: Pauli Principle**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, the isospin `T`, spin `S`, and orbital angular momentum `L` must satisfy `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given the condition that the final state has isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_final + L_final + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This means `S_final + L_final + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, the sum `S_final + L_final` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**Rule 4: Angular Momentum Coupling**\nFor the final NN state, described by `(2S_final+1)L_final(J_final)`, the quantum numbers must satisfy the triangle inequality for vector addition: `|L_final - S_final| <= J_final <= L_final + S_final`.\n\nA transition is **not permitted** if it violates any of these four rules.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's test each option against the rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `1 = 1`.

(**FAIL**)\n4.  **JLS Coupling (`|L_f - S_f| <= J_f <= L_f + S_f`):** `|1 - 1| <= 0 <= 1 + 1` => `0 <= 0 <= 2`. (OK)\n*Conclusion: This transition is NOT PERMITTED because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.*\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`. (Note: `S=3` is impossible for a two-nucleon system, as their spins of 1/2 can only combine to S=0 or S=1. However, we will test the transition against the given rules.)\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **Parity Conservation (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `3 + 2 = 5`. (OK)\n4.  **JLS Coupling (`|L_f - S_f| <= J_f <= L_f + S_f`):** `|2 - 3| <= 1 <= 2 + 3` => `1 <= 1 <= 5`. (OK)\n*Conclusion: This transition satisfies all the dynamical rules provided, although the final NN state itself is physically impossible. In the context of this type of problem, we identify the option that fails the explicit rules we are asked to apply.*\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTransition C (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`) is the only one that violates one of the explicit principles we must check (the Pauli principle). The condition `S_final + L_final` must be odd is not met, as `1+1=2` is even.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which transition is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Understand the System and the Rules\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1`  => Total spin `S_i = 0`.\n    *   `L = S` => Orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   `J = 0` => Total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The NN system emits a particle `X`.\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity of -1.\n    *   Let the orbital angular momentum of X be `l_X`. The spectroscopic notation is `s` for `l_X=0`, `p` for `l_X=1`, `d` for `l_X=2`, `f` for `l_X=3`.\n    *   The total parity of the emitted particle `X` is its intrinsic parity times its orbital parity: `P_X = (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(l_X + 1)`.\n\n*   **Final State:** A new NN state plus particle X.\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Let the final NN state have quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`.\n    *   The parity of the final NN state is `P_f = (-1)^L_f`.\n\n*   **Governing Rules:**\n    1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle (as given):** For the final NN state, `T_f = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T_f = 0`, the rule becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`. This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be **odd**.\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** `P_i = P_f * P_X`.\n        *   `+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1)^(l_X + 1)`\n        *   `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`\n        *   This implies `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even, which means `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n    3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n        *   `J_i = J_f + j_X = 0` (vector sum).\n        *   This requires their magnitudes to be equal, `J_f = j_X`.\n        *   Particle X's total angular momentum `j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its spin `s_X`. We don't know `s_X`, but a common particle emitted in such interactions is a pion, which has `s_X=0`. Let's assume `s_X=0`. This simplifies the condition to `J_f = l_X`. We will see this assumption is not critical.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed transition against our three conditions:\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f = l_X` (assuming `s_X=0`).\n\n---\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n---\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). **NOT OK**. This violates the given Pauli principle condition.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for the final NN state.*\n\n---\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. A `7D1` state implies `2S+1=7`, so `S=3`, which is not possible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, the final state is unphysical, making the transition forbidden.\n*   However, let's assume the state exists for the sake of argument and check the transition rules.\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: The transition itself satisfies all conservation laws and the given Pauli rule. The issue is the existence of the final state, which requires external knowledge. Option B violates a rule explicitly provided in the problem statement.*\n\n---\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. They are equal. **OK**.\n*Conclusion: This transition is permitted.*\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nAmong the four options, option **B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`** is the only one that violates the selection rules given in the problem statement (specifically, the Pauli principle condition for the final T=0 NN state). While option C describes an unphysical state, option B describes a process that is dynamically forbidden by a specified rule. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Conservation Laws\n\nThe final state consists of a two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and an emitted particle `X`.\nThe reaction is: `1S0 -> NN_f + X`\n\nWe must apply three main principles:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state:** The problem provides a condition: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number. This is our first condition.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`\n    *   `P_initial = +1` (as calculated above).\n    *   The final parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the final particles and the parity of their relative motion. `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f` (where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state).\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given in the problem for particle X).\n    *   `P_orbital = (-1)^L_X` (where `L_X` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X relative to the NN system, denoted by `s, p, d, f...`).\n    *   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^(L_f + L_X + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + L_X + 1)`.\n    *   This implies that the exponent `L_f + L_X + 1` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** number. This is our second condition.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final_system)`\n    *   `J_initial = 0`.\n    *   The final system's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n    *   `vec(J_final_system) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`.\n    *   So, `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`, which means `vec(J_f) = -vec(j_X)`.\n    *   This requires their magnitudes to be equal: `J_f = j_X`.\n    *   The particle X's total angular momentum `j_X` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `L_X` and its spin `S_X`. So, by the triangle inequality, `|L_X - S_X| <= j_X <= L_X + S_X`.\n    *   Thus, the condition is `|L_X - S_X| <= J_f <= L_X + S_X`. This must be possible for some valid spin `S_X`. This is our third condition.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against these three conditions.\nThe final NN state is given by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. The particle X state is `L_X` (`s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3`).\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S_f + L_f` is odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check (`L_f + L_X` is odd?):** `0 + 1 = 1`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Check (`J_f=j_X` possible?):** `J_f = 1`. We need `j_X = 1`. From `L_X=1`, this is possible (e.g., if `S_X=0`, `j_X=1`; if `S_X=1`, `j_X` can be 0, 1, 2). -> **OK**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n*   The state `7D1` implies `2S_f + 1 = 7`, which means `S_f = 3`. This is not a possible spin state for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Therefore, the final state `7D1` is physically impossible, and the transition is not permitted for this fundamental reason. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we should also check if any other option violates the specific rules provided in the prompt. Let's proceed to check the others.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S_f + L_f` is odd?):** `1 + 2 = 3`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check (`L_f + L_X` is odd?):** `2 + 3 = 5`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Check (`J_f=j_X` possible?):** `J_f = 3`. We need `j_X = 3`. From `L_X=3`, this is possible (e.g., if `S_X=0`, `j_X=3`; if `S_X=1`, `j_X` can be 2, 3, 4). -> **OK**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check (`S_f + L_f` is odd?):** `1 + 1 = 2`. (Even) -> **VIOLATION**\n2.  **Parity Check (`L_f + L_X` is odd?):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (Odd) -> **OK**\n3.  **Angular Momentum Check (`J_f=j_X` possible?):** `J_f = 0`. We need `j_X = 0`. From `L_X=0`, this requires `j_X = S_X`. So, `S_X` must be 0. This is possible. -> **OK**\n*   This transition violates the Pauli statistics condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd). Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have found two transitions that are not permitted:\n*   **B)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n*   **D)** is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics selection rule that was explicitly provided in the problem statement.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, you are expected to apply the rules given in the prompt. Option D is the only one that violates these explicitly mentioned transition rules. The impossibility of state B is based on the rules of angular momentum composition, which is prerequisite knowledge but not one of the \"rules of the game\" set out for this specific problem (parity, angular momentum conservation, and the specific Pauli rule). Thus, D is the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and the Process\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` tells us:\n        *   `2S_i+1 = 1` implies total spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   The letter `S` implies orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   The subscript `0` implies total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   **Parity of the initial state:** `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   **Isospin of the initial state:** The generalized Pauli principle for two identical nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. The condition is `L+S+T` must be odd. For the initial state, `L_i+S_i+T_i = 0+0+T_i` must be odd, which implies the isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The NN system emits a particle X. The reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN_f + X`.\n    *   Particle X has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (s, p, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X, `l_X`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Conditions for the Final State\n\nWe must check each potential transition against three main conditions:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem states a rule for the final NN state: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given that the final state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f=0` into the rule gives `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This implies that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd number**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the vector sum of the total angular momenta of the final products.\n    *   `vec(J_i) = vec(J_f) + vec(j_X)`\n    *   We know `J_i = 0`. The total angular momentum of particle X, `j_X`, is the sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_X` and its intrinsic spin `s_X`. Assuming X is a spin-0 particle (common in such problems unless specified otherwise), `j_X = l_X`.\n    *   The conservation law becomes `vec(0) = vec(J_f) + vec(l_X)`. This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P_orbital`\n    *   `P(NN_f)` is the parity of the final nucleon pair, which is `(-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P(X)` is the intrinsic parity of particle X, given as `-1`.\n    *   `P_orbital` is the parity from the relative motion of `NN_f` and `X`, which is `(-1)^l_X`.\n    *   Putting it all together: `P_i = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Since `P_i = +1`, we have `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`.\n    *   This requires `(-1)^{L_f + l_X} = -1`, which means `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd number**.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\n\nLet's check each of the given transitions against our three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   **Final NN State:** `7D1`. This implies `2S_f+1 = 7`, which means `S_f = 3`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is not permitted because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3P0`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   **Particle X (`s`-wave):** `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. This violates the Pauli statistics condition for a `T_f=0` final state.\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (Condition satisfied).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (Condition satisfied).\n*   The transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle condition (`S_f + L_f` must be odd).\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3S1`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   **Particle X (`p`-wave):** `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK).\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK).\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   **Final NN State (`3D3`):** `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   **Particle X (`f`-wave):** `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check Conditions:**\n    1.  **Pauli:** Is `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK).\n    2.  **Ang. Mom.:** Is `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK).\n    3.  **Parity:** Is `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK).\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth transitions A and B are not permitted.\n*   Transition A is impossible because the final state `7D1` is not a valid state for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Transition B is impossible because the combination of the final state `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1`) and the condition `T_f=0` violates the Pauli principle as stated in the problem (`S_f+L_f` must be odd).\n\nIn a multiple-choice context, there is likely a single intended answer. The question explicitly provides the Pauli statistics rule to be used. Option B fails this specific rule directly. The issue with option A is more of a fundamental state definition problem, and it's plausible the `7D1` term is a typo for a valid state like `3D1` (which would make transition A permitted). Therefore, the most likely intended answer is B, as its violation is directly tied to the rules provided in the question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\nThe notation `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1` => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The spectroscopic symbol `S` means `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The value `0` means `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe process is the emission of a particle X, so the reaction is `NN_initial -> NN_final + X`.\nThe final state consists of the final two-nucleon system (`NN_f`) and the emitted particle `X`.\n\nWe need to check three constraints for a transition to be \"permitted\":\n*   Conservation of Angular Momentum\n*   Conservation of Parity\n*   Pauli Principle for the final NN state\n\nLet's formalize these constraints.\n\n**Constraint 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved. `J_initial = J_final`.\n`J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`).\n`\\vec{J}_{final} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{J_X}`.\nThe particle X is specified by a lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`), which denotes its orbital angular momentum `L(X)` relative to the NN system. The problem gives no information about the spin of particle X (`S(X)`). For simple particle emissions like pseudoscalar mesons (e.g., pions, which have intrinsic parity -1), the spin is zero. We will assume `S(X) = 0`.\nTherefore, `J_X = L(X)`.\nThe conservation law `\\vec{J_i} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{L(X)}` becomes `\\vec{0} = \\vec{J_f} + \\vec{L(X)}`. This vector equation can only be satisfied if the magnitudes are equal: `J_f = L(X)`.\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Parity**\nThe total parity must be conserved. `P_initial = P_final`.\n`P_i = +1`.\nThe final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_f) * P(X)`.\n`P(NN_f) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\nThe parity of particle `X` has two parts: its intrinsic parity (`P_intrinsic(X) = -1`, given) and its orbital parity (`P_orbital(X) = (-1)^{L(X)}`).\nSo, `P_final = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L(X)} = (-1)^{L_f + L(X) + 1}`.\nThe conservation law `+1 = (-1)^{L_f + L(X) + 1}` requires the exponent `L_f + L(X) + 1` to be an even number. This is equivalent to `L_f + L(X)` being an **odd** number.\n\n**Constraint 3: Pauli Principle for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt also specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\nSubstituting `T_f = 0` into the formula:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. This is equivalent to `S_f + L_f` being an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe now check each of the four proposed transitions against these three rules. A transition is not permitted if it fails even one rule.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `L(X)=3`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J conservation):** `J_f = 3`, `L(X) = 3`. This satisfies `J_f = L(X)`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity conservation):** `L_f + L(X) = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli principle):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   *Note:* A state with `S=3` (`2S+1=7`) is physically impossible for a system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles), which can only have total spin S=0 or S=1. However, we will test it against the given rules first.\n*   **Rule 1 (J conservation):** `J_f = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. This satisfies `J_f = L(X)`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity conservation):** `L_f + L(X) = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli principle):** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Conclusion: According to the three specific rules derived from the prompt, this transition is permitted. The issue lies in the physical impossibility of the state `7D1` itself, which is information external to the provided transition rules.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `L(X)=1`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J conservation):** `J_f = 1`, `L(X) = 1`. This satisfies `J_f = L(X)`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity conservation):** `L_f + L(X) = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli principle):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `L(X)=0`.\n*   **Rule 1 (J conservation):** `J_f = 0`, `L(X) = 0`. This satisfies `J_f = L(X)`. **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 2 (Parity conservation):** `L_f + L(X) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   **Rule 3 (Pauli principle):** `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd. **(FAIL)**\n*   Conclusion: Not Permitted.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the only one that violates one of the explicit rules given in the problem statement (specifically, the Pauli principle constraint for the final state). While the final state in option B is physically impossible for two nucleons, the transition itself does not violate any of the selection rules laid out in the problem. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it is forbidden by the specified rules of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the not-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Rules\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have `1S0` -> `2S+1=1` so `S(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` means the orbital angular momentum `L(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The parity of a state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   The generalized Pauli principle for two nucleons (identical fermions) requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, which implies that the sum of their orbital angular momentum, spin, and isospin quantum numbers `L+S+T` must be an odd integer.\n    *   For the initial `1S0` state, `L=0, S=0`. So, `0+0+T` must be odd, which means the isospin of the initial state `T(initial) = 1`.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The initial NN system emits a particle `X` and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n    *   Particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1` and is emitted with a relative orbital angular momentum `l` (where `s` denotes `l=0`, `p` denotes `l=1`, etc.).\n    *   The final NN state has `T(NN_final) = 0` (given in the problem).\n\n*   **Conservation Laws and Selection Rules:**\n    1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. `J(initial) = J(final)`. Assuming particle X has no intrinsic spin (`S(X)=0`), the final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l`).\n        `vec(J(initial)) = vec(J_f) + vec(l)`\n        Since `J(initial) = 0`, we must have `vec(J_f) + vec(l) = 0`, which implies their magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l`.\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the system must be conserved. `P(initial) = P(final)`.\n        `P(initial) = +1`.\n        `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^l`.\n        So, `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l + 1)`.\n        This equation holds only if the exponent `L_f + l + 1` is an even number. This implies that `L_f + l` must be an odd number.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Principle for the Final State:** The question provides the condition `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is a restatement of the generalized Pauli principle (`L+S+T` must be odd). We are given that the final NN state has `T_f = 0`. Plugging this into the rule:\n        `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n        This requires `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number, which means `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions:\n1.  `J_f = l`\n2.  `L_f + l` is odd\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd\n\n---\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): The notation implies `2S+1=7`, which means `S=3`. This is impossible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only combine to a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Thus, the final state itself is not a valid two-nucleon state, and the transition is forbidden. This is a possible answer, but it's often the case in such problems that an obvious impossibility like this is a typo. Let's assume it's a typo for `3D1` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=1`) and check the rules to see if another option is forbidden. With this assumption:\n    *   Particle X (`p`): `l=1`.\n    *   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `1 = 1`. (OK)\n    *   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `2 + 1 = 3`. (OK)\n    *   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n    *   If it's a typo for `3D1`, the transition is permitted.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l=1`.\n*   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted by all rules.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l=3`.\n*   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted by all rules.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l=0`.\n*   Check 1 (`J_f=l`): `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Check 2 (`L_f+l` odd): `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 3 (`S_f+L_f` odd): `1 + 1 = 2`. This is an even number. **(Violation)**\n*   This transition violates the Pauli principle for the final state (`T_f=0` requires `S_f+L_f` to be odd). Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and D describe forbidden transitions. However, option A is forbidden because the state `7D1` cannot physically exist for a two-nucleon system. Option D describes a transition between physically plausible states (the term `3P0` is valid in spectroscopy) that is forbidden by a selection rule derived directly from the information given in the problem (the Pauli rule and `T_f=0`). In the context of such physics problems, the intended answer is typically the one that violates the explicitly mentioned conservation laws or selection rules. The issue in A is more likely a typo, which, if corrected to the most plausible alternative (`3D1`), would make the transition valid. This leaves D as the unique answer that violates the specific rules we are asked to apply.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The term symbol is given by `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S_i + 1 = 1`  => `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** `L` is denoted by 'S' => `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J` is given as '0' => `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a system is determined by its orbital angular momentum: `P = (-1)^L`. For the initial state, `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a system of two identical fermions (nucleons) requires the total wavefunction `Ψ = ψ(space)ψ(spin)ψ(isospin)` to be antisymmetric.\n    *   The symmetry of the spatial part `ψ(space)` is `(-1)^L`. For `L_i=0`, it's symmetric (+1).\n    *   The symmetry of the spin part `ψ(spin)` is `(-1)^(S+1)`. For `S_i=0`, it's `(-1)^(0+1) = -1` (antisymmetric).\n    *   For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, `(+1) * (-1) * ψ(isospin)` must be -1. This means `ψ(isospin)` must be symmetric, which corresponds to an isospin `T_i = 1`.\n    *   (Alternatively, the problem provides a rule `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`. For the initial state `S_i=0, L_i=0`, this would imply `T_i = 0 + 0 + 1 (mod 2) = 1`, which confirms our finding.)\n\nSo, the initial state is `(S_i, L_i, J_i, T_i, P_i) = (0, 0, 0, 1, +1)`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must check each proposed final state against three rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\n    The problem states `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    For the final state, we are given `T(NN, final) = 0`.\n    Plugging this in gives: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    This means `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. This is equivalent to stating that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\n    The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   `P_final = P(NN, final) * P(X, intrinsic) * P(X, orbital)`.\n    *   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n    *   `P(X, intrinsic) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(X, orbital) = (-1)^{L_X}`, where `L_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\n    The conservation equation is: `+1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1) * (-1)^{L_X}`.\n    `+1 = -1 * (-1)^{L_f + L_X}`.\n    `(-1)^{L_f + L_X} = -1`.\n    This means the exponent `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\n    The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the total angular momentum of the final NN system (`J_f`) and the total angular momentum of particle X (`J_X`). The simplest case, and the one implied by the notation, is to consider the vector sum of `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of X, `L_X`. For the total final angular momentum to be zero, these two vectors must be able to cancel each other out. This requires that they have equal magnitude, i.e., `J_f = L_X`.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the proposed transitions against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p` (p-wave): `L_X=1`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd).  **OK.**\n    2.  **Parity:** `L_f + L_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **OK.**\n    3.  **Ang.

Mom.:** `J_f = 1`, `L_X = 1`. `J_f = L_X`. **OK.**\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\nThe only transition that violates one of the fundamental rules is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve this problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's extract the quantum numbers:\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` for L corresponds to an orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The number `0` for J is the total angular momentum of the initial system, `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial two-nucleon system is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Pauli Principle for the initial state**: The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical fermions (nucleons) states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where `T` is the total isospin. For the initial state `1S0`, we have `L_i = 0` and `S_i = 0`. Therefore, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies that the initial isospin `T_i = 1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and Decay Process\n\nThe initial NN system decays into a final NN system and a particle X.\n`NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`\n\n*   **Particle X**:\n    *   It has an intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `d`, `f`), corresponding to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3`, respectively.\n    *   We will assume the intrinsic spin of particle X is `s_X = 0`, as is common in such problems unless specified otherwise. This means its total angular momentum is `j_X = l_X`.\n\n*   **Final NN State**:\n    *   Its quantum numbers are given by `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`.\n    *   The problem specifies that the isospin of the final NN state is `T_f = 0`.\n\n### 3. Establish the Conservation Laws and Rules\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy all relevant conservation laws and principles.\n\n1.  **Pauli Principle (Final State)**: The problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. With the given `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which means `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation**: The total parity of the final state must equal the total parity of the initial state.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`\n    *   For `P(initial) = P(final)`, we need `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`.\n    *   This implies that the sum `L_f + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = 0`\n    *   The total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and particle X's angular momentum (`l_X`, assuming `s_X=0`).\n    *   So, `J_i = J_f (vector sum) l_X`.\n    *   `0 = J_f (vector sum) l_X`\n    *   This is only possible if the magnitudes are equal, so `J_f = l_X`.\n\n4.  **Constituent Constraint**: The final NN state must be physically possible for two nucleons. Since nucleons are spin-1/2 fermions, their total spin `S_f` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet).\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will now check each of the four proposed transitions against these four rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=1`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=3`. This is **impossible** for a two-nucleon system.\n*   Conclusion: **Not permitted** because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S_f + L_f` must be odd for `T_f=0`.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=1`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: **Not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). OK.\n3.  **J-Conservation**: Is `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. OK.\n4.  **Spin Constraint**: `S_f=1`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: **Permitted**.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\n\nBoth options B and C describe forbidden transitions.\n*   **Option B** is forbidden because the final state (`7D1`) is impossible for two nucleons (`S` cannot be 3). This is a fundamental violation based on the system's constituents.\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because, for the given condition `T_f=0`, the final state `3P0` violates the generalized Pauli principle (`S_f+L_f` is even, not odd). This is a direct violation of a rule explicitly stated in the problem.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, when asked to use specific rules (like Pauli statistics here), the intended answer is usually the one that violates those explicit rules. The violation in option C is precisely an application of the Pauli statistics rule provided. The issue in option B is that the state itself is ill-defined for the system, which could be seen as a badly formed question or a very strong \"not permitted\" case. However, the most direct application of the provided rules points to C as the forbidden transition.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a **1S0** state.\nFrom the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can extract the quantum numbers:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the total orbital angular momentum is `L(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J(NN_initial) = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Final State and the Reaction\nThe process is the emission of a particle X: `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   It is emitted in a partial wave denoted by a lowercase letter (`s`, `p`, `f`), which corresponds to its orbital angular momentum `l_X`.\n        *   `s` => `l_X = 0`\n        *   `p` => `l_X = 1`\n        *   `f` => `l_X = 3`\n    *   No spin is mentioned for X, so we assume its spin is `s_X = 0`.\n*   **Final NN state:**\n    *   The problem specifies that the isospin of the final NN state is `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n\n### 3. Identify the Governing Laws and Rules\nThe problem asks us to use three specific constraints to determine which transition is forbidden:\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final State:** The problem provides the rule: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   We are given `T(NN_final) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get `0 = S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final) + 1` is an even number.\n    *   This implies that the sum `S(NN_final) + L(NN_final)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n    *   `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    *   `P(initial) = +1` (from step 1).\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)` where `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `+1 = (-1)^L(NN_final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN_final) + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   For this to be true, the exponent `L(NN_final) + l_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L(NN_final) + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum vector must be conserved.\n    *   `J(initial) = J(final)` (vector sum).\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   `J(final) = J(NN_final) + J(X)`. Assuming `s_X=0`, `J(X)` is just `l_X`.\n    *   So, the vector sum `J(NN_final) + l_X = 0`.\n    *   This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal: `J(NN_final) = l_X`.\n\n### 4. Analyze Each Option\nNow we apply these three rules to each of the proposed transitions. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is `3P0`: `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Emitted particle X is `s`: `l_X=0`.\n*   Check the rules:\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the rule that `S+L` must be odd for T=0.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). This is satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=0`, `l_X=0`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `3S1`: `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Emitted particle X is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Check the rules:\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). Satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `7D1`: `2S+1=7 => S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   A system of two nucleons (each spin-1/2) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. S=3 is physically impossible. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed.\n*   Let's check the given rules anyway, as instructed by the problem format:\n*   Emitted particle X is `p`: `l_X=1`.\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=1`, `l_X=1`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted** because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system. However, it does not violate the three specific rules the problem asks us to check.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state is `3D3`: `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Emitted particle X is `f`: `l_X=3`.\n*   Check the rules:\n    1.  **Pauli:** `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). Satisfied.\n    2.  **Parity:** `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). Satisfied.\n    3.  **Ang. Mom.:** `J=3`, `l_X=3`. `J=l_X` is satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\nWe have identified two \"not permitted\" transitions:\n*   **A)** is forbidden by the explicit Pauli rule given in the prompt.\n*   **C)** is forbidden by the fundamental principle that two nucleons cannot have a total spin of S=3.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the Pauli statistics rule. Option A is the only one that fails this specific set of checks. Option C fails on a more fundamental, but unstated, premise. In the context of such problems, one should prioritize the rules explicitly given. Therefore, option A is the intended answer as it's the one that is invalidated by the provided criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's break down the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   `L = S` (spectroscopic notation) implies the orbital angular momentum is `L_i = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` implies the total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial two-nucleon system is given by `P_i = (-1)^{L_i} = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe initial system decays into a final two-nucleon state (`NN_f`) and a particle `X`.\n`NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n\nThe properties of the final state are:\n*   Final NN state: Quantum numbers `S_f`, `L_f`, `J_f`. Its parity is `P_f = (-1)^{L_f}`.\n*   Particle X: Intrinsic parity `P_X_intrinsic = -1`. Orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3...).\n\nWe must apply three main rules: Pauli Statistics (as given), Parity Conservation, and Angular Momentum Conservation.\n\n**Rule 1: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt is also given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\nSubstituting `T_f = 0` into the rule:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\nThis equation means that `S_f + L_f + 1` must be an even number. Consequently, `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Condition 1: `S_f + L_f` must be odd.**\n\n**Rule 2: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity of the system must be conserved.\n`P_initial = P_final`\n`P(NN_i) = P(NN_f) * P(X_orbital) * P(X_intrinsic)`\n`(+1) = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)`\nMultiplying both sides by -1:\n`-1 = (-1)^{L_f} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_f + l_X}`\nThis implies that the exponent `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n*   **Condition 2: `L_f + l_X` must be odd.**\n\n**Rule 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n`J_i = J_{final_total}`\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\nThe final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN system's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (`j_X`).\n`\\vec{J}_{final_total} = \\vec{J}_f + \\vec{j}_X`\nSo, `0 = \\vec{J}_f + \\vec{j}_X}`, which means `J_f = j_X`.\nThe particle X has orbital angular momentum `l_X` and intrinsic spin `s_X`. Its total angular momentum `j_X` can take values `|l_X - s_X|, ..., l_X + s_X`. The spin `s_X` is unknown, but a valid transition requires that there exists *some* possible value of `s_X` that satisfies `J_f = j_X`. A simple case is to check if the condition holds for a spinless particle (`s_X=0`), where `j_X = l_X`.\n*   **Condition 3: It must be possible that `J_f = j_X` (where `j_X` depends on `l_X` and `s_X`).**\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nWe will now test each option against these three conditions. The option that violates any of these conditions is not permitted.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1 = 7` -> `S_f=3`. `L=D` -> `L_f=2`. `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\nA two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. The maximum possible total spin is `S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1`. A state with `S_f = 3` is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. Therefore, this transition is forbidden.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=1`, `l_X=1`. If X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X = 1`. So `J_f=j_X` holds. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). OK.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=3`, `l_X=3`. If X is spinless (`s_X=0`), `j_X = l_X = 3`. So `J_f=j_X` holds. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). This violates Condition 1, which requires `S_f + L_f` to be odd.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). OK.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=0`, `l_X=0`. Requires `j_X = 0`. Since `j_X = |l_X-s_X| ... |l_X+s_X|`, with `l_X=0`, we have `j_X=s_X`. So this would require `s_X=0`. OK.\n*   Conclusion: Not Permitted due to violation of the Pauli statistics rule.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\n\nWe have found two forbidden transitions:\n*   A is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   D is forbidden because the final NN state configuration (`3P0` with `T=0`) violates the given Pauli statistics requirement (`S_f+L_f` must be odd).\n\nBoth A and D describe an impossible process. However, the question provides an explicit and somewhat complex rule regarding Pauli statistics (`T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`) and instructs to \"Make use of\" the conservation laws. This strongly suggests that the intended forbidden answer is the one that violates these specific rules of the decay process. Option D is the only one that fails this test. The impossible spin in option A can be seen as either a typo in the problem or a \"distractor\" that relies on knowledge outside the immediate decay-rule framework presented. Following the logic prescribed by the problem leads directly to D being forbidden.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's decode the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin of the initial state is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` is the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial NN state is given by `P_i(NN) = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\nSince the system consists only of these two nucleons, the total parity of the initial state is `P_i_total = +1`.\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state is `J_i_total = J_i = 0`.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Conservation Laws and Constraints\nThe system decays via `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`. We must apply several conservation laws and constraints.\n\n**a) Isospin (T)**\nThe problem gives a specific formula for Pauli statistics, which depends on isospin. Let's determine the isospin of the initial state. The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for a two-nucleon system states that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, which leads to the condition `L + S + T` must be an odd integer.\nFor the initial `1S0` state: `L_i = 0`, `S_i = 0`. Thus, `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which implies `T_i = 1`.\nThe problem states the final NN state has `T_f(NN) = 0`.\nFor isospin to be conserved in the reaction, `T_i = T_f(NN) + T_x`.\n`1 = 0 + T_x`, so the emitted particle X must have isospin `T_x = 1`.\n\n**b) Particle X properties**\nParticle X has isospin `T_x = 1` and is given to have intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`. The most common particles fitting this description are pions (`π`, `π⁰`, `π⁺`), which are pseudoscalar mesons. This means they have spin `s_x = 0`. This is a crucial deduction.\n\n**c) Parity Conservation**\n`P_initial = P_final`\nThe initial parity is `P_i_total = +1`.\nThe final parity is `P_f_total = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`, where `l_x` is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n*   `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`, where `L_f` is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `P_orbital = (-1)^l_x`.\n\nSo, the conservation equation is:\n`+1 = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x`\n`+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`\nThis requires the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` to be an even number. Therefore, `L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.\n\n**d) Angular Momentum Conservation**\n`J_initial = J_final` (vector sum).\n`J_i_total = 0`.\nThe total final angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the particle X's total angular momentum (`j_x`).\n`j_x` is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum `l_x` and its spin `s_x`.\n`vec(J_f) + vec(l_x) + vec(s_x) = 0`.\nSince we deduced that `s_x = 0`, this simplifies to:\n`vec(J_f) + vec(l_x) = 0`.\nThis implies that the vectors `J_f` and `l_x` must have equal magnitude and opposite direction. Thus, their quantum numbers must be equal: `J_f = l_x`.\n\n**e) Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nGiven `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes:\n`0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number for the final NN state to be a valid state with `T=0`.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nWe will check each option against our derived conditions:\n1.  **State Validity (Pauli):** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_x` must be odd.\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** `J_f = l_x`.\n\nLet's create a table for clarity. (Note: `s` -> `l=0`, `p` -> `l=1`, `d` -> `l=2`, `f` -> `l=3`)\n\n| Option | Final NN State `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` | Particle X (`l_x`) | (1) `S_f+L_f` odd? | (2) `L_f+l_x` odd? | (3) `J_f = l_x`? | Permitted? |\n|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **A** | `3S1` (S=1, L=0, J=1) | p (l=1) | 1+0=1 (Yes) | 0+1=1 (Yes) | 1 = 1 (Yes) | Yes |\n| **B** | `3P0` (S=1, L=1, J=0) | s (l=0) | 1+1=2 (**No**) | 1+0=1 (Yes) | 0 = 0 (Yes) | **No** |\n| **C** | `3D3` (S=1, L=2, J=3) | f (l=3) | 1+2=3 (Yes) | 2+3=5 (Yes) | 3 = 3 (Yes) | Yes |\n| **D** | `7D1` (S=3, L=2, J=1) | p (l=1) | 3+2=5 (Yes) | 2+1=3 (Yes) | 1 = 1 (Yes) | No* |\n\n**Analysis of the Results:**\n\n*   **Options A and C:** All three conditions are met. These transitions are permitted.\n*   **Option B:** Fails condition (1). The proposed final state, `3P0` with `T=0`, violates the Pauli principle (`S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` is even). Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because it would lead to a non-existent quantum state.\n*   **Option D:** This option is more complex. It passes all three checks derived from the problem's text. However, the final NN state `7D1` itself is fundamentally impossible. A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. The maximum total spin `S` they can form is `1/2 + 1/2 = 1`. A state with `S=3` (which corresponds to `2S+1=7`) cannot be formed by two nucleons. Therefore, this transition is also not permitted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have two non-permitted transitions: B and D.\n*   The process in **B** is forbidden because the final NN state `(3P0, T=0)` violates the explicit Pauli statistics rule given in the problem.\n*   The process in **D** is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` is impossible to construct from two nucleons, a fact based on the rules of adding angular momentum.\n\nIn physics problems of this type, when a specific rule is provided (like the Pauli statistics formula), it is very likely intended to be the key to solving the problem. Option B is directly ruled out by this provided rule. The issue with Option D relies on an unstated (though fundamental) piece of knowledge. Therefore, Option B is the most direct and intended answer based on the problem's framing.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's interpret the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total initial spin is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` denotes the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   This is consistent since `J_i` must be between `|L_i - S_i|` and `L_i + S_i`, which is just 0.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i`.\n*   `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Final State and Particle X\nThe process is: `Initial NN (1S0) -> Final NN ((2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)) + Particle X`.\n*   **Final NN state**: Has spin `S_f`, orbital angular momentum `L_f`, and total angular momentum `J_f`. Its parity is `P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`.\n*   **Particle X**:\n    *   Intrinsic parity is given as `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its spin is `s_x`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the final NN system is `l_x`. The spectroscopic notation for `l_x` is given by the lowercase letters: `s` (l_x=0), `p` (l_x=1), `d` (l_x=2), `f` (l_x=3).\n\n### 3. Apply the Conservation Laws and Given Conditions\n\nThere are three key conditions that must be satisfied for a reaction to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Parity Conservation**\nThe total parity must be the same before and after the reaction.\n*   `P_initial = P_final`\n*   `P_i = +1`\n*   The final parity is the product of the parities of the final components: `P_final = P_f(NN) * P(X) * (-1)^l_x`. The `(-1)^l_x` term comes from the parity of the spatial wave function for the relative motion of X.\n*   `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_x = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`.\n*   For parity to be conserved: `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_x + 1)`.\n*   This means the exponent `L_f + l_x + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, the first condition is: **`L_f + l_x` must be an odd number.**\n\n**Condition 2: Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\nThe problem explicitly states a condition for the final NN state:\n*   `T_f(NN) = S_f(NN) + L_f(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`\n*   We are also given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f(NN) = 0`.\n*   Substituting this in, we get: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if `S_f + L_f + 1` is an even number (a multiple of 2).\n*   Therefore, the second condition is: **`S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.**\n\n**Condition 3: Angular Momentum Conservation**\nThe total angular momentum must be conserved.\n*   `J_initial = J_final`\n*   `J_initial = J_i = 0`.\n*   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the angular momenta of the two final components: `J_f` (of the NN system), `l_x` (orbital of X), and `s_x` (spin of X).\n*   Vector sum: `J_f + l_x + s_x = J_final = 0`.\n*   This means the three angular momentum vectors must be able to form a closed triangle (or lie collinearly and sum to zero). The condition on their magnitudes is given by the triangle inequality. A reaction is permitted only if there exists a valid spin for particle X (`s_x >= 0`) that satisfies this. The general condition is **`|J_f - l_x| <= s_x <= J_f + l_x`**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nNow we apply these three conditions to each option. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state is `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state is `f`: `l_x=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 1 + 2 = 3 (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_x` = 2 + 3 = 5 (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=3`, `l_x=3`. We need `|3-3| <= s_x <= 3+3`, which means `0 <= s_x <= 6`. This is possible (e.g., if X has spin `s_x=1`). **OK**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state is `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state is `s`: `l_x=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 1 + 1 = 2 (even). This **VIOLATES** the condition that `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n*   **Conclusion**: **NOT PERMITTED**.\n\nSince we have found a non-permitted reaction, we can stop here. However, for completeness, let's analyze the other options.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n    *(Note: S=3 is not physically possible for a system of two nucleons, which can only have S=0 or S=1. However, we check if the process violates the specific rules given in the problem statement.)*\n*   Particle X state is `p`: `l_x=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 3 + 2 = 5 (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_x` = 2 + 1 = 3 (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=1`, `l_x=1`. We need `|1-1| <= s_x <= 1+1`, which means `0 <= s_x <= 2`. This is possible. **OK**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Permitted by the given rules, despite the unphysical nature of the final NN state.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state is `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state is `p`: `l_x=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f` = 1 + 0 = 1 (odd). **OK**.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l_x` = 0 + 1 = 1 (odd). **OK**.\n3.  **Ang. Mom. Check**: `J_f=1`, `l_x=1`. We need `|1-1| <= s_x <= 1+1`, which means `0 <= s_x <= 2`. This is possible. **OK**.\n*   **Conclusion**: Permitted.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe only reaction that violates the conditions given in the problem is **B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**, as it fails the Pauli statistics requirement for the final state.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
