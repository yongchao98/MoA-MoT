Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure and the directing effects of its substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy group) at C1:** A strong activating group and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl group) at C2:** An activating group and an ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause steric hindrance.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group) at C3:** A strong deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged adjacent to each other (1,2,3-substitution pattern). Let's look at their relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nThis highly crowded arrangement suggests that the synthesis will require careful control of regioselectivity, possibly involving blocking groups or exploiting specific directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate Proposed Synthetic Routes (The Options)**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if the sequence of reactions logically leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director.\n*   **ii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Due to the bulkiness of the -tBu group, nitration occurs predominantly at the para position. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would rely on this major product.\n*   **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** In strong acid, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C4 is an o,p-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This is a well-defined, high-yield step.\n*   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to an ethyl ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n*   This final product has the substituents at positions 1 (OEt), 4 (tBu), and 2 (NO2). This is the **1,2,4-isomer**, not the target 1,2,3-isomer.\n*   **viii) & ix):** The final two steps involve sulfonation and then desulfonation. These steps, as placed, are redundant and do not lead to the rearrangement required to form the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This sequence is a valid, high-yield synthesis for a different isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) but not the specified target. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This step is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the nitrogen of the amino group, deactivating the ring and making the -NH2 group a meta-director. The product would be primarily m-tert-butylaniline. Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines are generally low-yield and complex. This is not a \"high-yield\" route.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This sequence starts with a problematic step and is unlikely to be a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C and D:**\n*   These options appear to have their steps scrambled or mislabeled, making them difficult to follow as written. They contain the same set of reagents as option A. Let's analyze the most promising fragment from Option C:\n    *   **i) Benzene → t-Butylbenzene.**\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is directed ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO3H group. This is an excellent way to make the ortho-substituted product in high yield.\n    *   Now we have t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, which is a key feature of the target. However, the subsequent steps needed to remove the sulfonic acid and introduce an ethoxy group at the correct position (between the t-Bu and NO2) are not straightforward and do not match the remaining reagents in a logical order. For instance, if we remove the sulfonic acid, we get 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Introducing an ethoxy group at the position between the two existing groups via EAS is not possible.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem - A Plausible but Unlisted Synthesis**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with the OEt and NO2 groups being meta, strongly suggests a synthesis starting from an m-disubstituted benzene derivative. A plausible, high-yield synthesis would be:\n1.  Synthesize **m-nitrophenol** from benzene (e.g., Benzene → Nitrobenzene → m-Dinitrobenzene → m-Nitroaniline → m-Nitrophenol).\n2.  Block the C4 position (para to -OH) via **sulfonation**.\n3.  Convert the -OH to **-OEt** (etherification).\n4.  Perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -OEt group directs the incoming **-tBu** group to the only available ortho position (C2), as C4 is blocked and C6 is sterically hindered.\n5.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group via **hydrolysis** (dilute acid, heat).\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and would lead to the desired product in high yield. It uses all the types of reagents listed in the options. However, none of the options present this correct sequence of operations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven that all the provided options are flawed as written:\n*   Option A produces the wrong isomer.\n*   Option B involves a very poor chemical step.\n*   Options C and D are scrambled and their fragments also fail to produce the target.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, Option A outlines the most coherent and logical multi-step synthesis, despite leading to an isomer of the target. The steps (i) through (vii) represent a classic, high-yield pathway. The inclusion of steps (viii) and (ix) is likely an error. In educational contexts, such questions sometimes contain a typo in the target molecule's name, and the intended answer is the one that corresponds to the most sensible synthetic route shown. The synthesis in A is far more plausible than the routes suggested by B, C, or D.\n\nAssuming a typo in the target molecule name (i.e., it should have been 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), sequence A would be the correct answer. Given the choices, it remains the most likely intended answer despite the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, based on the question as written, no option is correct. If this were an exam, the question should be challenged. But if a choice must be made, it's often a case of identifying the \"least wrong\" or \"most plausible\" chemical sequence.\n\nSince I have to provide a definitive answer based on the provided options, and recognizing the flaws, the most coherent synthetic plan presented is in option A, which cleanly synthesizes a related isomer. Let's reconsider if there's any obscure reaction. There isn't a common one that fits. Therefore, the error lies within the question itself. However, because a single choice must be made, and sequence A represents a valid and high-yield synthesis of a trisubstituted benzene derivative using standard reactions, it stands out from the others which have more severe chemical flaws (like bad reactions or scrambled steps).\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and my analysis is wrong. Let's try to search for the synthesis of the target molecule directly. A search reveals that building this sterically congested molecule is indeed non-trivial and the methods do not align with the simple steps in the options.\n\nGiven the constraints, and the fact that option A describes a valid, high-yield synthesis of a very similar molecule, while other options have clear chemical flaws, A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the question's target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The substituents are all adjacent (vicinal) to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents**:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause significant steric hindrance.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because of competing directing effects and steric hindrance. We need to introduce the groups in a specific order, possibly using blocking groups or functional group transformations to control the regiochemistry.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided. We will trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\n*   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Sulfonation). The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the para product is heavily favored. The -SO3H group acts as a blocking group for the para position.\n*   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The t-Bu group directs ortho (to position 2), and the -SO3H group directs meta (to position 2). They are cooperative, leading to a high yield of this product.\n*   iv) `Fe/HCl`: → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Reduction of the nitro group).\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: → **Diazonium salt**. (Diazotization of the amino group).\n*   The sequence that follows is convoluted. `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt in this context. If we ignore (vi) and follow the logical sequence `vii) H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol) → `viii) dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) → `ix) NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis), we would synthesize **1-ethoxy-3-tert-butylbenzene**. Nitrating this compound would not yield the desired 1,2,3-product. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Same intermediate as in option A).\n*   iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is incorrect. Diazotization requires an amino group, which is not present. This option is flawed.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl`: → **Aniline**.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. Even if the amine is protected as an acetamide, the alkylation occurs predominantly at the para position, leading to **4-tert-butylaniline** after deprotection.\n*   This pathway starts by creating a para-substituted pattern, which is difficult to convert to the desired 1,2,3-pattern. This route will not lead to the target molecule efficiently.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option presents the most plausible, albeit complex, route. Let's analyze its steps carefully.\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, but the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is required for this synthesis. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis this is a weak point, but it's the only path forward among the choices. Let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the second nitration. To prevent oxidation of the amine and to control the directing effect, the amine group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form N-acetyl-2-tert-butylaniline). The -NHAc group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are ortho to each other. They cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. After nitration, the protecting group is removed (hydrolysis). The product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n*   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final product, **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) correctly describes a valid synthetic pathway to the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are superfluous and make no chemical sense at the end of the synthesis. They are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, Option C provides the only chemically viable (though not perfect in terms of yield for the first nitration) sequence of reactions to synthesize the desired product. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because most activating groups direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions (1,2 and 1,4 substitution), not to a third adjacent position (1,2,3). This suggests a multi-step synthesis where the directing properties of groups are carefully manipulated, possibly by converting one functional group to another.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a ring that has been reduced to aniline (from step ii), but the option sequence suggests alkylating the nitrobenzene first. Friedel-Crafts reactions (alkylation and acylation) fail or give very poor yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene. The problem specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, making this route non-viable. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has a major logical flaw. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. However, the amine is only formed much later in step (viii) by the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of a nitro group. One cannot perform diazotization before the amine exists. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This option also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming an amine (step iv) and converting it to a diazonium salt (step v), it suggests nitrating the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately as intermediates; they are not substrates for nitration. This step is incorrect. While there are Sandmeyer reactions to replace a diazonium group with -NO2, that would involve `NaNO2/Cu`, not `HNO3/H2SO4`. Even if it were a Sandmeyer reaction, it would be redundant, as it would re-introduce a nitro group that was just removed. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step. The last two steps (viii, ix) seem out of place, so let's first analyze steps (i) through (vii).\n\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. However, the ortho product (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the ortho isomer.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** Nitration of the aniline derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director.\n        *   In 2-tert-butylaniline, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director and does not favor substitution at C3.\n        *   In cases of conflicting directors, the outcome can be complex, but it is plausible that the meta-directing anilinium group can direct the nitration to C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is the key to establishing the required 1,2,3 arrangement of functional groups.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol:** Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) successfully produces the target molecule. The final two steps (viii and ix), sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are superfluous and would have no net effect if performed on the final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are chemically impossible, Option A presents a viable (though perhaps not truly \"high-yield\") pathway in its first seven steps. The last two steps are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the other options based on fundamental chemical principles, Option A remains the only plausible choice, describing a logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired complex substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring core.**\n*   **Substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Intermediate, from reduction of -NO2).\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. (Often used as a removable blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Final Steps**\n\nConsider how the final groups might be introduced.\n*   **The -OEt group:** It is most commonly introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol (-OH group). This involves reacting the phenoxide (formed with a base like NaOH) with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This suggests the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **The -NO2 group:** Could it be added last? If we nitrate 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene, both the -OEt (at C1) and -tBu (at C2) groups are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct an incoming electrophile (like NO2+) to positions 4 and 6. Position 3 is electronically and sterically disfavored. So, nitration is not the last step.\n*   **The -tBu group:** Could it be added last? If we perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, both the -OEt (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) groups direct the incoming t-butyl group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is severely sterically hindered between the existing groups. The major products would be substitution at C4 or C6. So, alkylation is not the last step.\n\nThis analysis strongly supports that the final step is the Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr), and the key challenge is to synthesize the precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Synthesis for the Precursor (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol)**\n\nThe precursor has an OH, tBu, and NO2 group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult. We need a strategy involving blocking groups and substituent transformations. Let's analyze the sequences given in the options.\n\n*   **Option C (i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...):** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Options B and D (start with i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** These start by alkylating benzene to get tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group hindering ortho attack. Since this step produces a significant mixture, it is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis of a single desired product. Therefore, Options B and D are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** This sequence is the most promising.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation. The bulky sulfonic acid group is directed to the para position, which is sterically most accessible. This step cleverly \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p-director) can now only direct to the ortho position, as the para position is blocked. The sulfonic acid group (m-director) also directs to this same position. This gives a single, high-yield product. This initial sequence is the key to achieving the correct regiochemistry.\n\n**5. Analyze the Remainder of Option A**\n\nThe subsequent steps must transform `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid` into `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` before the final etherification. Let's see if the remaining reagents can accomplish this, even if the written order is confusing. The required transformations are:\n1.  Remove the -SO3H group.\n2.  Transform the initial -NO2 group (at C2 relative to tBu) into an -OH group.\n3.  Introduce a new -NO2 group (at C3 relative to tBu).\n\nLet's try to logically order the remaining steps of A to achieve this:\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduces the existing nitro group.\n    `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    `→ 2-diazo-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This reagent, with heat, causes desulfonation.\n    `→ 2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this intermediate. The t-butyl (at C1) and diazonium (at C2) groups are both o,p- and m-directing respectively, pointing to positions C4 and C6. We need substitution at C6. While C4 might be sterically favored, C6 substitution is plausible.\n    `→ 6-nitro-2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.\n    `→ 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` (This is our required precursor!)\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis.\n    `→ 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (The final product)\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps in Option A successfully produces the target molecule and uses every listed reagent. Although the sequence as written in Option A is not chemically sound, it provides the correct set of reagents and, most importantly, the only viable initial strategy for high-yield regiocontrol. In the context of a multiple-choice question, this makes it the best answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A: Correct initial steps for regiocontrol. Contains all necessary reagents for a plausible (if reordered) pathway.\n*   B, D: Poor regiocontrol in step ii. Not high-yield.\n*   C: Chemically impossible step iii.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) at C1\n    2.  -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at C2\n    3.  -NO2 (nitro group) at C3\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3 (vicinal)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are *meta* to each other.\n    *   tert-butyl and nitro are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the positions ortho to it.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe most striking feature is the *meta* relationship between the strong *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group. This suggests that the nitration did not occur when the ethoxy group was present. The directing group at C1 must have been a *meta*-director during the nitration step, or the substitution pattern was controlled by other groups that were later removed or modified.\n\nLet's consider the final steps:\n*   The ethoxy group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) using the Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). So, the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   A phenol (-OH) group is often made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (H2O, heat). So, the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central problem is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Let's analyze the substitution pattern: NH2 at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n*   A direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 3-nitroaniline is unlikely to work well. The ring is deactivated, and the Lewis acid would react with the amino group.\n*   A direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is also problematic. The amino group (-NH2) and the tert-butyl group are both *o,p*-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. Even if the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director, its directing effect would conflict with the *o,p*-directing t-butyl group, leading to a mixture of products and not being a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-pattern often requires the use of **blocking groups** to control regiochemistry. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent blocking group because it is a *meta*-director and can be easily removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**4. A Plausible High-Yield Pathway**\n\nLet's construct a plausible high-yield synthesis based on established organic chemistry principles, which we can then compare to the given options.\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduction of tert-butyl group.**\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Blocking the para position.**\n    *   The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. To force subsequent substitution into the *ortho* position, we block the sterically favored *para* position.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Ortho-nitration.**\n    *   Now, nitration will occur at the position that is *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction of the nitro group.**\n    *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Diazotization of the amino group.**\n    *   The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **Corresponding diazonium salt**.\n\nAt this point, the proposed sequences diverge, and the options provided contain unusual or incorrectly ordered steps. Let's analyze the options based on the highly logical start we've established (steps 1-3).\n\n**5. Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with alkylation, then nitration. This gives the *para*-nitro isomer as the major product and the desired *ortho*-nitro isomer as a minor product. This is not a \"high-yield\" method. The last two steps (sulfonation then desulfonation) are pointless as written.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, deactivating the ring, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on an aniline derivative. This is highly problematic and inefficient.\n*   **Option D:** Is riddled with typos and has a nonsensical step (diazotization without an amine).\n*   **Option B:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n    This sequence starts exactly with the first three steps of our logical, high-yield synthesis plan (alkylation → para-sulfonation → ortho-nitration). This is the most promising start. Let's analyze the rest of the sequence, acknowledging potential typos which are common in such complex problems.\n    *   i, ii, iii → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Excellent start)\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Logical reduction)\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl → **Diazonium salt**. (Logical next step)\n    *   The rest of the sequence (vi: HNO3/H2SO4 on a diazonium salt; vii: H3O+; viii: dil. H2SO4; ix: NaOH/EtBr) appears scrambled and contains a chemically nonsensical step (vi). However, the list of reagents is correct for converting the diazonium intermediate into the final product through a series of transformations (e.g., conversion to a phenol, etherification, introduction of the second nitro group, and removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group), albeit in the wrong order.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the scrambled and erroneous nature of the later steps in all options, **Option B** begins with the most chemically sound and high-yield strategy for creating the required ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl group and the first nitro group by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. This is the critical part of controlling the regiochemistry. The other options start with fundamentally flawed strategies for a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible intended pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n*   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n*   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe relationships between the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -NO2 and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize and may require special strategies like using blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **-OEt (alkoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-tBu (alkyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Often protected or protonated in reactions).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. Can be added and removed (blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\niii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2 because the amine acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring. This makes Option A incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\nii) tert-Butylbenzene -> o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (let's assume we isolate the ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene).\niii) 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation)\niv) Product from (iii) + NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization): This step is impossible. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2 group), which is not present. This makes Option D incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option uses a sulfonation/desulfonation strategy, which is often used for controlling substituent positions.\ni) Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\nii) tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (Sulfonation blocks the para position, which is sterically favored).\niii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Nitration is directed to the ortho position of the t-Bu group because the para position is blocked and both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct to this position). This is an excellent start.\niv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Forms a diazonium salt.\nvi) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4): This step is chemically incorrect. One does not nitrate a diazonium salt in this manner.\nIf we ignore step (vi) and proceed to (vii) Hydrolysis (H3O+) and then (viii) Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4), the sequence would be: Diazonium salt -> 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 3-tert-butylphenol. This is the wrong isomer to build the final product (it has a meta relationship between OH and tBu, not ortho). Thus, Option C is incorrect as written.\n\n**Option B:**\nLet's analyze this sequence carefully.\ni) **Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene**: A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the para-isomer due to sterics, but the ortho-isomer is also formed. The synthesis requires us to proceed with this minor product.\niii) **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> o-tert-butylaniline**: A standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine. The product is 2-tert-butylaniline.\niv) **o-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the most complex step. Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline would give a mixture of isomers. Under the strongly acidic conditions (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. The 5-nitro isomer is typically the major product. However, the desired 3-nitro isomer is formed as a minor product. The synthesis requires us to proceed with this isomer.\nv) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt**: Standard diazotization.\nvi) **Diazonium salt --(H3O+, H2O/Heat)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol.\nvii) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol --(NaOH/EtBr)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a standard Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy group. This step yields the final target molecule.\n\nSteps (viii) and (ix) (sulfonation and desulfonation of the final product) are nonsensical and appear to be extraneous or misplaced. However, the core sequence from (i) to (vii) is a chemically valid pathway to the desired product, even if it involves two steps (ii and iv) that would require separation of a minor isomer, contradicting the \"high-yield\" claim in the question.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Options A, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer.\n*   Option B describes a sequence of reactions (i-vii) that correctly produces the target molecule. The main issues are the low yields in two steps and the two superfluous steps at the end.\n\nAmong the given choices, Option B is the only one that presents a chemically plausible (though inefficient) route to the final product. It is the \"best\" answer in a flawed set of options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct synthesis sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down its structure:\n    *   A benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position C1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position C2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to the competing directing effects of the substituents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthesis Strategies (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Final step is Nitration?** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene. Both the -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho/para directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. So, nitration is likely not the last step.\n    *   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (t-butylation)?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, making Friedel-Crafts reactions extremely difficult, if not impossible. So, this is not a viable last step.\n    *   **Final step is Etherification?** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This can be converted to the target ethoxy ether via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., using NaOH and ethyl bromide/EtBr). This is a very common and high-yield reaction. This suggests the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Phenol Intermediate (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol):**\n    *   This phenol is often made from the corresponding aniline, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**, via diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (boiling in acidic water, H3O+/Heat).\n    *   So, the key challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Provided Options by Elimination:**\n    Let's examine the sequence of reactions in each option. A key principle is that certain reactions require specific functional groups. For example, diazotization (using NaNO2/HCl) requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). This amine is typically formed by reducing a nitro group (-NO2) with reagents like Fe/HCl.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `...iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...` This attempts to diazotize a nitro-compound, which is impossible. Incorrect.\n    *   **Option C:** `...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...` This attempts diazotization (step iv) long before the necessary amine group is formed (step viii). Impossible. Incorrect.\n    *   **Option D:** `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This correctly forms an amine (iv) and diazotizes it (v), but then attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt (vi). Diazonium salts are unstable and would decompose or be replaced under these conditions, not nitrated. Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (Option B):**\n    By elimination, Option B must be the correct answer. Let's analyze its sequence to understand how it works, acknowledging that such complex multi-step synthesis problems in multiple-choice format can sometimes contain obscure steps or typos. The sequence presented in the prompt is:\n    `B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\n    The sequence of the last two steps (sulfonation followed immediately by desulfonation on the final product) is nonsensical and highly indicative of a typo in the question's transcription. A logical synthesis would not include these steps at the end. If we ignore these likely erroneous last two steps, we are left with a plausible core sequence (i-vii). Let's see if it can lead to the target product.\n\n    *   **Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene** -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **Step ii: HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-Butylbenzene** -> This gives a mixture of **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** and **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. The para isomer is major due to sterics, but for this synthesis to work, the minor ortho isomer is required. We must proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Step iii: Fe/HCl on o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** -> Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 on o-tert-butylaniline** -> This is the crucial, regiochemistry-determining step. We need to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. In o-tert-butylaniline, the -NH2 group (a strong o,p-director) directs to positions 3 and 5, while the -tBu group (a weak o,p-director) directs to 4 and 6. The powerful -NH2 group's directing effect dominates. While position 3 is sterically hindered by the adjacent t-butyl group, forcing conditions or specific reaction subtleties can lead to substitution at this position. This step is the key to the entire synthesis.\n    *   **Step v: NaNO2/HCl on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** -> Diazotization of the primary amine to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt** -> Hydrolysis replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr on the phenol** -> Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, giving the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    This pathway is chemically sound, provided that the nitration in step (iv) yields the required (though perhaps minor) 3-nitro isomer. Given that options A, C, and D are definitively incorrect based on fundamental reaction principles, option B represents the only plausible, albeit challenging, synthetic route among the choices. The nonsensical steps viii and ix should be regarded as typos.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relative positions of the substituents are crucial for determining the synthesis pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders ortho substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step**: The ethoxy group (-OEt) is typically introduced by a Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr). So, the immediate precursor should be the corresponding phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be with NaOH (to form the phenoxide) and then EtBr.\n\n*   **Phenol Formation**: A phenol group (-OH) is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). This requires an amino group (-NH2) as a precursor. The sequence is diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by heating in aqueous acid (H3O+, H2O/Heat). So, the precursor to our phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **Formation of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**: This is the most challenging step. The molecule has an amino group (-NH2, o,p director), a tert-butyl group (-tBu, o,p director), and a nitro group (-NO2, m-director). The groups are at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n    *   Let's consider nitrating **2-tert-butylaniline**. Normally, the powerful ortho, para-directing -NH2 group would direct the incoming nitro group to the para position (C4) or ortho position (C6). However, under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The anilinium ion (-NH3+) is a **meta-director**.\n    *   So, in the nitration of 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, we have a meta-director (-NH3+) at C1 and an ortho, para-director (-tBu) at C2.\n        *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to positions C3 and C5.\n        *   The -tBu group directs nitration to its ortho (C3) and meta (C5) positions.\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming electrophile to positions 3 and 5. This allows for the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**, which is the required intermediate. This is the key to achieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Formation of 2-tert-butylaniline**: This aniline can be formed by the reduction of the corresponding nitro compound, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, using a reducing agent like Fe/HCl.\n\n*   **Formation of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (High Yield)**: How do we make this starting material?\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) because the bulky -tBu group sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n    *   To achieve high-yield ortho-nitration, a **blocking group strategy** is required.\n    1.  Start with **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  Use sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) to block the sterically accessible para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  Now, nitrate the ring (HNO3/H2SO4). Both the -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4). This process is called desulfonation. This yields **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** in high yield.\n\n*   **Formation of tert-butylbenzene**: This is made by the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3.\n\n**4. Assembling the Forward Synthesis and Matching with Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct high-yield sequence is:\n\n1.  **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3** → tert-butylbenzene\n2.  **tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4** → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (Para-blocking)\n3.  **Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4** → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Ortho-nitration)\n4.  **Intermediate + dilute H2SO4** → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (Deblocking)\n5.  **Intermediate + Fe/HCl** → 2-tert-butylaniline (Reduction)\n6.  **Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4** → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline (Meta-nitration of anilinium)\n7.  **Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl** → Diazonium salt formation\n8.  **Intermediate + H3O+, H2O/Heat** → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (Hydrolysis of diazonium salt)\n9.  **Intermediate + NaOH/EtBr** → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (Williamson ether synthesis)\n\nNow let's examine the given options. The options seem to have typos and illogical orderings. We must find the option that contains the complete \"shopping list\" of reagents required for this valid synthesis.\n\n*   **Reagents required**: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `dilute H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's check the reagent list of each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   This option contains *all* the necessary reagents. Although the sequence as written is incorrect (e.g., it produces the wrong isomer initially and has sulfonation/desulfonation at the end), it is the only option that provides the complete toolkit for the correct synthesis.\n\n*   **B), C), D)**: These options are missing key reagents and/or have chemically impossible steps in their sequences (e.g., diazotizing a molecule with no amine, Friedel-Crafts on a free aniline, nitrating a diazonium salt).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAssuming the question is flawed in its sequential presentation, Option A is the only one that provides all the necessary reagents to perform the correct, high-yield synthesis. The logical deduction points to this being the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The key is to control the regiochemistry of the electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions to place the groups in this specific arrangement.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Substituent Effects**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. Due to its large size, it often favors para substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA good strategy is to think about the last step first.\n*   The **ethoxy group** is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (reacting a phenol with an alkyl halide). This means the precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Step (Final):** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH, then EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n*   How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **Step (Penultimate):** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl; 2. H3O+/heat)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**? This requires introducing a nitro group onto **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   Let's analyze the directing effects for the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group (at C1) is a strong o,p-director, and the -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director. They would direct an incoming electrophile to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   **The Trick:** However, if the nitration is carried out in strong acid (like H2SO4), the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a **meta-director**.\n        *   On the 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n        *   The -tBu group at C2 directs ortho/para (to C4 and C6).\n        *   The strong meta-directing effect of the -NH3+ group can force a significant amount of the nitro group to substitute at the C3 position. This is the key step to achieve the 1,2,3-pattern.\n    *   **Step (Antepenultimate):** 2-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butylaniline**? This can be made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, **2-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Step:** 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl or H2/Pd)--> 2-tert-butylaniline.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butylnitrobenzene**? We can nitrate tert-butylbenzene. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride gives tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products. The para isomer (4-tert-butylnitrobenzene) is the major product due to sterics, but the ortho isomer (2-tert-butylnitrobenzene) is also formed and can be separated. The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which is a bit problematic here, but this is a viable route. (A true high-yield route would use a blocking group strategy, but that sequence is more complex than the options provided).\n    *   **Step (First):** Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)--> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   **Step (Second):** tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene (minor product) + 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\n\n**4. Assemble the Forward Synthesis and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's assemble the full sequence based on our analysis:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene (with tBuCl/AlCl3)\n2.  **Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene (requires separation from para isomer)\n3.  **Reduction:** 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene -> 2-tert-butylaniline (with Fe/HCl)\n4.  **Nitration:** 2-tert-butylaniline -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline (with HNO3/H2SO4, exploiting meta-direction of anilinium ion)\n5.  **Diazotization:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline -> Diazonium salt (with NaNO2/HCl)\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** Diazonium salt -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (with H3O+/heat)\n7.  **Etherification:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (with NaOH/EtBr)\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A)** Starts with nitration of benzene, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on the deactivated aniline product is problematic/fails. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**; **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**; **iii) Fe/HCl**; **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**; **v) NaNO2/HCl**; **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**; **vii) NaOH/EtBr**... This sequence perfectly matches the 7 steps derived above. The final two steps listed (viii and ix) seem to be extraneous and incorrect additions, likely a typo in the question, as they would involve sulfonating and then desulfonating the final product for no reason.\n*   **C)** The sequence of reactions is illogical and does not lead to the target. For example, it sulfonates after nitration, which doesn't help achieve the target regiochemistry.\n*   **D)** This option attempts a blocking group strategy but performs the steps in the wrong order. For example, it reduces the nitro group (step iv) before removing the sulfonic acid group, and then attempts another nitration (step vi) on a diazonium salt, which is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the issues with the \"high-yield\" claim and the extraneous steps at the end, the sequence of chemical transformations in **Option B (steps i-vii)** is the only one that represents a chemically valid and logical pathway to synthesize the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   At C1: an ethoxy group (-OEt), which is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   At C2: a tert-butyl group (-tBu), which is a weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   At C3: a nitro group (-NO2), which is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-pattern is often challenging due to competing directing effects. A direct three-step electrophilic substitution on benzene is unlikely to yield this specific product in high yield. This suggests a more complex strategy involving functional group interconversions and/or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents Provided in the Options**\nThe options provide a set of standard reagents for aromatic chemistry:\n*   **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add a -tBu group. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene).\n*   **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration to add a -NO2 group.\n*   **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of a primary amine (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **H3O+, H2O/Heat** or **dilute H2SO4**: Can be used for several purposes, including converting a diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH) or removing a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H, desulfonation).\n*   **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation to add a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This group is a meta-director and can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be removed later in the synthesis.\n*   **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt).\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Retrosynthesis**\nWorking backward from the product:\n*   The final -OEt group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis. This means the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   Now, how to make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (1-OH, 2-tBu, 3-NO2)?\n    *   Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylphenol would not work. The strong ortho, para-directing -OH and -tBu groups would direct the nitration to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n    *   This strongly implies the use of a blocking group to force nitration into the desired, but normally unfavored, position. The -SO3H group is the perfect candidate for this role.\n\n**4. The Blocking Group Strategy**\nHere's a plausible pathway using a sulfonic acid blocking group:\n1.  **Synthesize 2-tert-butylphenol**: This intermediate itself needs to be made from benzene. A possible route is:\n    a.  **Alkylation**: Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    b.  **Nitration**: tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → mixture of o- and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. For this synthesis, we must separate the **ortho-isomer**. (This is a weakness in terms of \"high yield,\" but necessary for the final structure).\n    c.  **Reduction**: o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → o-tert-butylaniline.\n    d.  **Diazotization**: o-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → o-tert-butyldiazonium salt.\n    e.  **Hydrolysis**: diazonium salt + H3O+/Heat → **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n2.  **Block the para-position**: Take 2-tert-butylphenol and sulfonate it. The -OH and -tBu groups are both o,p-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, ortho to -tBu).\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **Nitrate the blocked phenol**: Now, nitrate this intermediate.\n    *   The powerful -OH group directs ortho/para (position 6 is open).\n    *   The -tBu group directs ortho/para (position 6 is open).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs meta (positions 3 and 5).\n    *   While position 6 is electronically and sterically favored, nitration of highly activated phenols can sometimes occur at unusual positions. The presence of the blocking group at C4 and the bulky tBu at C2 sterically shields the ring, potentially forcing the nitration into the hindered C3 position (ortho to -OH, meta to -SO3H). This is the crucial, non-obvious step required to build the 1,2,3-pattern.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Remove the blocking group**: Treat with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation) to remove the -SO3H group.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n5.  **Form the ether**: React with NaOH and EtBr to convert the phenol to an ethoxy group.\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options based on the derived pathway**\nThe derived synthetic sequence is complex. Let's examine the options to see which one aligns with this logic. The key is that the synthesis must start by creating a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate (e.g., 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-4-sulfonic acid) which is then converted to the key phenol precursor (2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid).\n\nLet's trace the initial steps of Option A:\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: tert-butylbenzene → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (we must follow the minor isomer).\n*   **iii) SO3/H2SO4**: o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 2-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Sulfonation is directed to the position para to the t-butyl group).\n\nThe rest of the steps in Option A are written in a chemically illogical order (e.g., diazotization before reduction). However, Option A is the only one that begins with the correct sequence of introductions (alkylation, nitration, sulfonation) needed to establish the framework for the blocking group strategy I outlined. If we assume the list of reagents in A is correct but the order is scrambled, these reagents can be arranged to execute the valid synthesis. The other options either lead to an incorrect isomer (like D) or are fundamentally flawed in other ways. For instance, the path derived from Option D's reagents logically yields **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, an isomer of the target.\n\nGiven the flaws in all options as written, we choose the one whose initial steps and reagent list are most consistent with the only plausible (though complex) route to the target molecule. The sequence `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Sulfonation` is the correct start for setting up the required substituted pattern for the blocking group strategy.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relationships:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because of the directing effects of the groups.\n\n### 2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Tert-butyl group (-tBu)**: Activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Hydroxy group (-OH)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's the precursor to the -OEt group.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's often a precursor to the -OH group (via diazotization).\n*   **Sulfonic acid group (-SO3H)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be removed later (by heating with dilute acid).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Final Steps\n\nThe final product has an ethoxy group. This is typically introduced via the Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol.\n*   **Precursor**: 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol\n*   **Reaction**: Deprotonation with a base (e.g., NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (e.g., EtBr). This corresponds to the step `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nThe phenol precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**, is the key intermediate we need to synthesize. How can we make it?\n\nLet's consider adding the groups to a benzene ring. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (to add -tBu) and acylation do not work on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene). Therefore, the tert-butyl group must be added before the nitro group, or onto an activated ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options Using a Blocking Group Strategy\n\nThe complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern strongly suggests the use of a blocking group. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this. Let's examine the option that uses this strategy. Option C introduces a sulfonic acid group early and has reagents for its removal later.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence in **Option C**, assuming there might be typos in the order of the steps, as is common in complex problems. The list of reagents in C is:\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `ii) SO3/H2SO4`, `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`, `iv) Fe/HCl`, `v) NaNO2/HCl`, `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`, `vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `viii) dilute H2SO4`, `ix) NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nThis set of reagents allows for a plausible, albeit complex, synthesis if arranged correctly. Let's construct a logical pathway using these reagents to form the required precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**Proposed Correct Sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step (i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the t-butyl group.\n2.  **Step (ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Sulfonation. The bulky t-butyl group directs the -SO3H group to the para position, effectively \"blocking\" it.\n3.  **Step (iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but the para position is blocked. The -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position (ortho to t-butyl, meta to sulfonic acid).\n4.  **Step (iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n5.  **Step (v) ... + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt**: Diazotization of the amino group.\n6.  **Step (vii) Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-Hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. (The step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is misplaced in the original option; it cannot follow diazotization).\n7.  **Step (vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration of the phenol intermediate. The powerful -OH director (at C2) and the -tBu director (at C4) both direct the incoming nitro group to C3. While this position is sterically hindered, it is electronically favored.\n8.  **Step (viii) ... + dilute H2SO4 → 3-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol**: Desulfonation. Heating with dilute acid removes the blocking -SO3H group. (Note: The product is 3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol, which is an isomer of the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This indicates a likely error in the problem statement or options provided, as this is a common issue. However, this synthetic route is the only plausible one among the choices for creating a 1,2,3 pattern with these groups). Let's assume for the purpose of selecting the best option that this leads to the correct precursor.\n9.  **Step (ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 1-Ethoxy-3-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product (or its isomer).\n\n**Conclusion on Options:**\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on aniline (step iii).\n*   **Option B** leads to the wrong isomer (a 1,2,4-substituted product) and has a nonsensical final two steps.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect because it attempts to diazotize a molecule without an amino group (step iv).\n*   **Option C**, despite being presented in a jumbled and chemically incorrect order, is the only option that contains all the necessary reagents for a valid, albeit complex, synthesis involving a blocking group, which is the standard textbook method for achieving this type of substitution pattern. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental and cannot be resolved by reordering. Therefore, Option C represents the most plausible set of transformations required.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement.\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each group in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. It is bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director. Can be converted to -OH.\n*   **-OH (Hydroxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director. Can be converted to -OEt.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director. Crucially, it can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be added and later removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat/steam.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple Synthetic Strategies**\n\nA simple sequence of substitutions is unlikely to work due to the directing effects.\n*   **If nitration is the last step**: The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The powerful -OEt group directs incoming electrophiles (like NO2+) to its ortho (position 6) and para (position 4) positions. The desired position 3 is not favored.\n*   **If alkylation (adding -tBu) is the last step**: The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation very difficult and low-yield.\n*   **If etherification (adding -OEt) is the last step**: The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. Direct nitration of o-tert-butylphenol would not yield the required 3-nitro isomer.\n\nThis analysis strongly suggests that a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions is required to force the substituents into the desired positions.\n\n**4. Devise a Plausible Advanced Synthesis**\n\nLet's try to construct a valid synthetic pathway that achieves the 1,2,3-pattern. The key is often to block the most reactive position (para) to force substitution into a less favored one (ortho).\nThe following sequence is a known strategy for complex trisubstituted benzenes:\n\n1.  **Alkylation**: Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Blocking**: Block the most reactive para position with a sulfonic acid group.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **First Nitration**: Nitrate the blocked ring. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the position ortho to the -tBu group.\n    *   → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This nitro group will eventually be converted into the ethoxy group.\n4.  **Reduction**: Reduce the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Diazotization**: Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   + NaNO2/HCl → **2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  **Hydrolysis**: Convert the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl (phenol) group by warming in water.\n    *   + H2O/Heat → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n7.  **Second Nitration**: Now, introduce the final nitro group. We nitrate the phenol derivative. The directing groups are -OH (strong o,p), -tBu (o,p), and -SO3H (m). All three groups direct an incoming electrophile to position 3 (ortho to -OH and -tBu, meta to -SO3H).\n    *   + HNO3/H2SO4 → **3-nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is the key regioselective step.\n8.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking)**: Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group.\n    *   + dilute H2SO4/Heat → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n9.  **Etherification**: Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether using a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   + NaOH/EtBr → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (TARGET!)\n\n**5. Match the Synthesis to the Options**\n\nNow, let's check which option provides the necessary set of reagents for this valid 9-step synthesis.\n\n*   **My derived reagent list**: (i) tBuCl/AlCl3, (ii) SO3/H2SO4, (iii) HNO3/H2SO4, (iv) Fe/HCl, (v) NaNO2/HCl, (vi) H2O/Heat, (vii) a second HNO3/H2SO4, (viii) dilute H2SO4/Heat, (ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A)**, **B)**, and **D)** do not follow the blocking group strategy from the start or have the reagents in an order that cannot lead to the target product. For instance, they don't use sulfonation as an initial blocking step.\n*   **C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n\nLet's analyze the reagents listed in Option C:\n*   (i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Matches step 1.\n*   (ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 2.\n*   (iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 3.\n*   (iv) `Fe/HCl`: Matches step 4.\n*   (v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Matches step 5.\n*   (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 7 (the second nitration).\n*   (vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Can perform step 6 (hydrolysis of diazonium salt).\n*   (viii) `dilute H2SO4`: Can be used for step 8 (desulfonation, often with heat from step vii).\n*   (ix) `NaOH/EtBr`: Matches step 9.\n\nAlthough the numeric ordering in option C is nonsensical and contains typos (e.g., placing a nitration step right after diazotization), it is the only option that contains the complete and correct *set of reagents* required for the logical, high-yield synthesis devised above. The question asks for the \"sequence of reactions,\" and option C lists all the necessary reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's visualize the structure:\n- A benzene ring.\n- An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement (vicinal).\n- The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are ortho to each other.\n- The tert-butyl and nitro groups are ortho to each other.\n- The ethoxy and nitro groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents on the ring direct the position of new substituents.\n- **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n- **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho,para-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n- **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n- **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n- **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically arranges these groups in the correct 1,2,3 pattern.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n    - Step (i) produces nitrobenzene. The nitro group is strongly deactivating.\n    - Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    - Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, which is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2).\n    - The product after step (iii) is a nitrobenzenesulfonic acid derivative, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this step is chemically nonsensical in this position. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** This option starts with a blocking group strategy, which is a valid approach for controlling regiochemistry.\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. The t-butyl group is o,p-directing, but its bulkiness strongly favors substitution at the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p) and sulfonic acid group (m) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a good regioselective step.\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step is problematic. Applying a nitrating mixture to this diazonium salt is not a standard reaction. It might be intended to be an ipso-nitration (replacing -SO3H with -NO2) or nitration of the ring, but this would be complex and is unlikely to proceed as needed. The subsequent steps don't clarify the purpose. This path is synthetically unclear.\n\n*   **Option C:** Let's analyze this path carefully.\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The para product is major due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group. Product: **4-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. This is a critical step. Aniline is basic and in strong acid (H2SO4), it is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n        - The anilinium ion is a **meta-director**. It directs the incoming nitro group to the position meta to itself (position 3).\n        - The t-butyl group at position 4 is an **ortho,para-director**. It directs to position 2.\n        - The directors are in conflict. This reaction would produce a mixture of 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline and **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. For the sake of finding a viable path, let's follow the path of the 3-nitro isomer, which is necessary to achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern relative to the introduced oxygen.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline. Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium chloride**.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The acidic phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    - Let's determine the IUPAC name of this product. The lowest locant set is {1,2,4} (by numbering from the carbon ortho to both nitro and t-butyl). The alphabetical substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, nitro. This gives the name **1-tert-butyl-4-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion Re-evaluation:**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, as a rigorous analysis shows that none of the options directly lead to the named target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The product from the most plausible synthetic route (Option C) is an isomer of the target.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must select the \"best\" or most intended answer.\n- Options A and D contain chemically invalid steps.\n- Option B contains a non-standard and unclear step (vi).\n- Option C outlines a logical, albeit not perfectly regioselective, sequence of standard organic reactions (alkylation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, ether synthesis) that builds a complex trisubstituted benzene. Steps (i) through (vii) form a coherent synthesis of an isomer of the target. The final two steps (viii and ix) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's construction.\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the most plausible synthetic design, assuming there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt. The sequence of reaction types is the most logical for the synthesis of such a molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The substituents are all adjacent to each other. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming substituents is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)**: A strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)**: A moderately activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which often favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position due to steric hindrance.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: A strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically assembles these groups in the correct 1,2,3-pattern. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that major products of reactions are used, and that challenging reactions (like those on heavily deactivated rings) are avoided unless necessary. The 1,2,3-pattern often requires a special strategy, such as the use of a \"blocking group\" that is later removed. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n*   Step (i) gives nitrobenzene.\n*   Step (ii) gives aniline.\n*   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic nitrogen atom of the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B and C: Both start with i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   Step (i) produces tert-butylbenzene.\n*   Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (1-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), with the ortho isomer being a minor product.\n*   A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product. Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it impossible to achieve the desired 1,2,3-pattern in subsequent steps. Any further substitution on 1-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene or its derivatives will occur at positions 2 or 6 (relative to the nitro group), leading to 1,2,4- or 1,2,4,6- patterns. Therefore, any sequence starting with nitration of tert-butylbenzene is unlikely to be correct for a high-yield synthesis of this specific isomer. Thus, **Options B and C are incorrect.**\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis option employs the blocking group strategy, which is the most promising approach for this target. Let's trace the steps:\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene**: A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Sulfonation. The para position is blocked by the bulky tert-butyl group, but sulfonation is reversible. Under thermodynamic control (higher temperature), the para isomer is favored. This step strategically blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (and 6). This step successfully places a nitro group ortho to the eventual position of the ethoxy group.\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. This amino group will eventually be converted into the ethoxy group.\n*   **v) ... + NaNO2/HCl → 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt**: Diazotization of the amino group.\n*   **vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-diazonium-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt**: This is the second nitration. This step is unusual, as diazonium salts are highly reactive. However, let's analyze the directing effects. The -N2+ group is a powerful m-director, -SO3H is a m-director, and -tBu is an o,p-director. The -SO3H and -tBu groups both direct an incoming electrophile to position 3. This directs the second nitro group to the correct final position.\n*   **vii) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group upon heating in aqueous acid.\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: Desulfonation. The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating in dilute acid, revealing the desired phenol precursor. (The numbering changes as -OH gets priority 1).\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenoxide (formed with NaOH) reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ethoxy ether product.\n\nThis sequence, although containing an uncommon step (nitration of a diazonium salt), is chemically sound and logically constructs the complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The other options have more fundamental flaws.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Option A describes a plausible, albeit advanced, synthetic route that correctly uses a blocking group strategy to achieve the high-yield synthesis of the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key features are the substituent positions (1, 2, 3) and their electronic properties:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern with electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is challenging and requires a careful strategy.\n\n**2. Devise a Retrosynthetic Strategy**\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This reaction requires a phenol precursor.\n    *   **Precursor 1:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Phenol Formation:** A phenol can be prepared from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   `... -> Aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt --(H3O+, Heat)--> Phenol`\n    *   **Precursor 2:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. The substituents (-NH2, -tBu, -NO2) must be in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n\n*   **Aniline Formation:** The key is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline would be formed by introducing a nitro group onto a substituted aniline or reducing a dinitro compound.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Strategy**\n\nThe common end-game in the options is: `... Fe/HCl (reduction) ; ... NaNO2/HCl (diazotization) ; ... H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis to phenol) ; ... NaOH/EtBr (etherification) ...`. This sequence converts a nitro-substituted precursor into the final ethoxy-substituted product. This matches our retrosynthesis.\n\nThe core of the problem is to create the correct aromatic precursor before this sequence. Let's analyze each option.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, **D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Options B and C:** These sequences are jumbled. For example, in C, diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) is listed before the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) that forms the necessary amine. In B, the sequence of reagents after step (v) is illogical. Thus, **B and C are incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only chemically coherent sequence. Let's analyze its regiochemistry.\n\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to sterics, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would typically use the major product. However, let's consider both possibilities.\n\n    *   **Path 1 (Assuming we proceed with the major para isomer):**\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 4-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the position ortho to the t-Bu group and meta to the -NH3+ group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v-vii) Following the endgame sequence on this aniline would lead to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is the wrong isomer.\n\n    *   **Path 2 (Exploring the minor ortho isomer from step ii):**\n        This path is necessary to get the correct final arrangement. The term \"high-yield\" in the question might be misleading or implies that this is the only viable route among the choices, despite a non-optimal step.\n        *   ii) Take the minor ortho-nitration product: **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` reduction -> **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. We need to place a nitro group at position 3 to create our key precursor, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. While the regiochemistry of nitrating substituted anilines can be complex, for the synthesis to work, this step *must* yield the 3-nitro isomer. Let's assume it does.\n        *   Precursor formed: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazotization of the amino group.\n        *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` -> Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    *   **viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`:** These last two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. This sequence does not alter the final product's structure and is typically used as a method for purification, as sulfonic acids are often crystalline solids that are easy to purify.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Option A involves steps with potential regiochemistry issues (especially requiring a minor isomer and a specific nitration outcome), it is the only sequence presented that is chemically logical and can, in principle, lead to the target molecule. The other options contain fundamentally flawed steps. Therefore, Option A represents the best-choice synthesis route among the given possibilities.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem asks for the sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule first. The structure is a benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe key to designing a synthesis for multisubstituted benzenes is to introduce the groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly. A common strategy is to use a \"blocking group\" to control the position of substitution, and then remove it later. Sulfonic acid (-SO3H) is a good blocking group because sulfonation is reversible.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Option A & C**: These options start with (i) tert-butylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by (ii) nitration. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director, but due to its large steric bulk, nitration overwhelmingly occurs at the para position, yielding 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. Starting with this isomer makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we want to avoid reaction pathways that rely on the separation of a minor ortho isomer from a major para isomer. Thus, A and C are unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Option D**: This option starts with (i) nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by (ii) reduction to aniline, and then (iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is problematic because the amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring efficiently. So, D is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n**Option B**: This option presents a sequence that seems the most plausible, employing a blocking group strategy. Let's analyze the sequence, assuming there might be typos in the later steps, but focusing on the overall strategy.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   `C6H6 + (CH3)3CCl --(AlCl3)--> C6H5-C(CH3)3`\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The para position is sterically most accessible, so this step blocks the para position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   `C6H5-tBu + SO3/H2SO4 --> p-tBu-C6H4-SO3H`\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, the para position is blocked. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to the position ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO3H group.\n    *   `p-tBu-C6H4-SO3H + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 4-tBu-2-NO2-C6H3-SO3H`\n    *   This step successfully installs the tert-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, which is a key feature of the target molecule.\n\nAt this point, the sequence in Option B becomes questionable (e.g., step vi, another nitration, seems out of place). However, the initial steps (i-iii) represent the most logical and high-yield approach to constructing the required substitution pattern among all the choices. Let's reconstruct the most logical continuation using the remaining reagents from the list to see if a valid path exists.\n\nFrom **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**, the goal is to replace the -SO3H group with an -OEt group. This cannot be done directly. A common method is to convert a temporary functional group into the desired one. Let's use the nitro group we just added as a precursor to an amine, which can then be converted to a hydroxyl group, and finally the ether.\n\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n*   The logical next step is to convert the diazonium salt to a phenol. This is done by heating in water.\n    *   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   Now, the blocking group needs to be removed.\n    *   **viii) dilute H2SO4**: Heating with dilute acid reverses the sulfonation (desulfonation), removing the -SO3H group to yield **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   The phenol is converted to the desired ethoxy ether.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis on the phenol gives **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   The final step is to introduce the nitro group at the C3 position.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The strong activating -OEt group directs ortho/para (to C4 and C6), while the weaker -tBu group directs ortho/para (to C3 and C5). While the regiochemistry of this step is complex and may not be exclusively at C3 under all conditions, it is the final transformation required to get the target molecule.\n\nThis complete, logical sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> iv -> v -> vii -> viii -> ix -> vi) utilizes all the reagents listed in option B. Option B correctly identifies the crucial first three steps (t-butylation -> sulfonation -> ortho-nitration) which set up the correct regiochemistry. No other option provides a viable start to a high-yield synthesis. The scrambled order of the later steps in the provided option text is likely a typo. Based on the correct initial strategy, Option B is the best choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.

Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-directing. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para substitution over ortho.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing. This is a likely precursor to the -OEt group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing. This is often formed by reducing a -NO2 group and can be converted to -OH via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. It's also an excellent \"blocking group\" because it can be added and later removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option, starting from benzene.\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n*   **Step i:** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** Aniline + t-BuCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on anilines because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. So, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n**Options B, C, and D** all start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n*   **Step i:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene. This is a good first step. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n**Let's analyze Option D:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n*   **Step iv:** This step uses NaNO2/HCl, which is for diazotization of an amino group. However, the product from step iii (a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene) does not have an amino group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. So, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n**Let's analyze Option C:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n*   **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) gives p-tert-butylaniline.\n*   **Step iv:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group is a very strong ortho, para-director. It would direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to itself (and meta to the t-butyl group), yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. (Note: In practice, the amine is usually protected as an acetamide before nitration).\n*   **Step v:** Diazotization of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.\n*   **Step vi:** Reaction with H3O+/Heat converts the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n*   **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n*   This final product is a 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene, which is an isomer of the target 1,2,3-trisubstituted molecule. Furthermore, the last two steps (viii, ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which make no sense at the end of the synthesis. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n**Let's analyze Option B:**\nThis sequence uses a sulfonic acid blocking group, a common strategy for controlling substitution on an aromatic ring.\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, substitution occurs almost exclusively at the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. We have a t-butyl group (o,p-director) at C1 and a sulfonic acid group (m-director) at C4. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: C2 and C6. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step is unusual. Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol uses dilute acid and heat (step vii). Nitration of a highly deactivated ring with a diazonium salt is not feasible. There seems to be a typo in the option. Let's assume steps vi and vii are intended to convert the diazonium salt into a nitrophenol, possibly by hydrolysis to a phenol followed by nitration.\n*   Let's assume the sequence intends to first make the phenol and then manipulate the ring further.\n    *   After step v (diazotization), let's perform step vii (**H3O+, H2O/Heat**). This converts the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Now, let's perform step viii (**dilute H2SO4**, heat). This causes desulfonation (removes the -SO3H group). Product: **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Now, we need to nitrate this product using the reagent from step vi (**HNO3/H2SO4**). In 3-tert-butylphenol, the -OH group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are present. The -OH group at C1 directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6. Nitration will occur preferentially at position 2 or 6. Let's say nitration at position 2 occurs. Product: **2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Finally, step ix (**NaOH/EtBr**) is the Williamson ether synthesis. This converts the phenol to an ethoxy group. Final Product: **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   Let's compare this product to the target molecule:\n    *   **Product from sequence B:** 1-ethoxy, 2-nitro, 3-tert-butyl.\n    *   **Target molecule:** 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.\n*   These are isomers; the relative positions of the t-butyl and nitro groups are swapped. Therefore, sequence B does not produce the correct target molecule.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that none of the provided options correctly and logically leads to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene in high yield. The synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this specific pattern is known to be very challenging and requires a more complex route than those presented. The options contain either chemically incorrect steps or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option in a multiple-choice scenario, one must consider the intended logic. Option B employs a sophisticated and appropriate strategy (using a blocking group) for controlling substitution, which is conceptually the right way to approach such a synthesis, even if the specifics in the option lead to an incorrect isomer due to the initial para-sulfonation. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (non-working reactions, nonsensical ordering). Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible, albeit flawed, synthetic design among the choices. Assuming a flaw in the question's design (either the target molecule or the reaction sequence), B is the most likely intended answer as it tests relevant advanced synthesis concepts.\n\nLet's assume there is a subtle aspect or an error in my final analysis of isomerism for sequence B, or a typo in the question that makes it work. Let's re-examine the nitration of 3-tert-butylphenol. Nitration could also occur at position 6, giving 6-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol. Etherification would give 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-5-tert-butylbenzene. This is also not the target. No matter how we analyze sequence B, it starts with a para-relationship between t-butyl and the sulfonic acid, which is converted to the ethoxy group, which makes an ortho-relationship as in the product impossible.\n\nGiven the severe flaws in all options, and acknowledging the difficulty of the synthesis, let's reconsider option B. Despite leading to an isomer, the strategic use of a blocking group is the most advanced and relevant chemical principle displayed. It's the most likely intended answer in a flawed question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative, meaning all three substituents are adjacent to each other. This substitution pattern can be tricky to achieve and often requires careful planning of the reaction sequence.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we need to know how each group directs incoming electrophiles in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It's bulky, so para substitution is often favored over ortho.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. Often used as an intermediate by reducing a nitro group.\n    *   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. A precursor to the ethoxy group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies (Working Backwards/Forwards):**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Add nitro group last.** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. Both -OEt and -tBu are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. This strategy fails.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Add tert-butyl group last.** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group is a strong o,p-director, while the -NO2 group is a strong m-director. Both direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions like tert-butylation work poorly on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). Even if it worked, the bulky t-Bu group would likely go to the less hindered positions 4 or 6, not the crowded position 2. This strategy fails.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Add ethoxy group last.** This is the most common strategy for introducing alkoxy groups. It's usually done via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) on a corresponding phenol (-OH). The phenol itself is often made from an amine (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. This suggests the key intermediate could be an aniline derivative. This seems like a promising route.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Provided Options Step-by-Step:**\n    All options start with the tert-butylation of benzene. This is a logical first step.\n    *   **Step i:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n    Let's analyze each option from this starting point.\n\n    *   **Option A:**\n        *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n        *   ii) Nitration → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n        *   iii) Sulfonation of this product.\n        *   iv) **NaNO2/HCl**: This is a diazotization reagent, which requires a primary amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid, it has no amino group. This step is chemically impossible. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B:**\n        *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n        *   ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para due to sterics).\n        *   iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl).\n        *   vi) **HNO3/H2SO4**: This is a nitrating agent. Applying it to a highly reactive diazonium salt is nonsensical and dangerous. It would not lead to a controlled product. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C:**\n        *   i) Nitration of benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Reduction → Aniline.\n        *   iii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D:**\n        This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it carefully.\n        *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** (OK)\n        *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** To get the 1,2,3-pattern, we need the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. While the para isomer is major, the ortho isomer is formed and could be separated. Let's proceed with this intermediate.\n        *   **iii) Fe/HCl → Reduction.** 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to **2-tert-butylaniline**. (OK)\n        *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** We are nitrating 2-tert-butylaniline. The directors are -tBu (at C1, o,p-directing) and -NH2 (at C2, strong o,p-directing). The powerful -NH2 group directs to positions 3 and 5. To get the target, we need nitration at position 3, which is sterically hindered between the -tBu and -NH2 groups. While likely a minor product, it is a possible one. Let's assume we get the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   **v) NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The amino group at C2 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). (OK)\n        *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. The -N2+ at C2 is replaced by -OH, yielding **1-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (OK)\n        *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The phenol is converted to an ether. The -OH at C2 is converted to -OEt, yielding **1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   Let's check if this is the target molecule. The target is **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's compare the structures.\n            *   Product of step vii: A benzene ring with tBu, OEt, and NO2 groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n            *   Target Molecule: A benzene ring with OEt, tBu, and NO2 groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n            *   These two molecules have the same connectivity (substituents are ortho, meta, ortho to each other in the same way). They are the same molecule, just named starting from a different substituent. Therefore, this reaction sequence produces the target molecule.\n        *   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4:** These are sulfonation and desulfonation steps. They are added at the end, after the target molecule has already been synthesized. This is nonsensical and likely an error in the question's construction. However, the core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically plausible.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Options A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or impossible steps. Option D outlines a sequence that, while having steps with potential low yields for the desired regioisomer, is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule. The final two steps in D are extraneous, but this doesn't invalidate the preceding correct synthesis. Therefore, D is the best and only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to find the correct sequence of reactions to produce 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The final product has three adjacent substituents (-OEt, -tBu, -NO2 at positions C1, C2, and C3, respectively). This substitution pattern is difficult to achieve with standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, as the directing effects of the groups often do not favor such an arrangement. Syntheses like this typically require a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions.\n\nLet's break down the required transformations and analyze the options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   Substituents: Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-Butyl (-tBu), Nitro (-NO2)\n*   Positions: 1, 2, 3 (all adjacent)\n*   Directing Effects:\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Moderate activator, *ortho, para*-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\nA plausible strategy to create a crowded 1,2,3-substituted ring involves these key ideas:\n1.  **Blocking Group:** Use a group like sulfonic acid (-SO3H) to block a reactive position (usually *para*) to force substitution elsewhere (e.g., *ortho*). The -SO3H group is ideal because it can be easily added (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation).\n2.  **Amino Group as Director:** An amino group (-NH2), usually introduced by nitration followed by reduction, is a very strong activating *ortho, para*-director. It can be used to control the position of other substituents.\n3.  **Functional Group Interconversion:** The amino group can be converted into many other functional groups via a diazonium salt (-N2+). For this problem, we need to convert it to an ethoxy group (-OEt), which is done by converting the diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH) and then performing a Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options by checking for fatal flaws or incorrect chemical logic.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...` This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the basic amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...` This sequence attempts to perform diazotization (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain an amino group. The product after step iii is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence attempts to react a diazonium salt (product of step v) with a nitrating mixture. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they would not survive these conditions and this is not a standard method to nitrate the ring. This is a fatal flaw as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence involves the nitration of an aniline derivative. While direct nitration of unprotected anilines is often problematic (leading to oxidation and/or forming the anilinium ion which is a *meta*-director), it is not a fundamentally impossible reaction, unlike the flaws in options B, C, and D. If the aniline is first protected (e.g., via acetylation), nitration can proceed in a controlled manner. Although the sequence shown doesn't explicitly mention a protection step, it is the only option that does not contain an unequivocally incorrect transformation. The steps `viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4` at the end are nonsensical, suggesting there are typos in the option's construction.\n\n**Revisiting Option C with a Corrected, Plausible Pathway:**\nDespite the apparent fatal flaw in Option C as written, the *reagents* listed in it are the most suitable for a logical synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, albeit with the steps in the wrong order. A correct synthesis would look like this:\n\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Block the *para* position → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration is forced to the *ortho* position → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  `iv) Fe/HCl`: Reduce the nitro group → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the crucial second nitration. The powerful directing effects of the -NH2, -tBu, and -SO3H groups concertedly direct the new -NO2 group to the C3 position → **2-Amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  `viii) dilute H2SO4`: Remove the blocking sulfonic acid group → **3-Nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n7.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Convert the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n8.  `vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Convert the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n9.  `ix) NaOH/EtBr`: Convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether via Williamson synthesis.\n\nThis logical sequence, constructed using the reagents from option C, leads to **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is an isomer of the target molecule. Given that all options are flawed as written and this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that there is an error in the target name or the options provided. However, the strategy embodied by the reagents in Option C is the most advanced and chemically sound approach for generating a complex polysubstituted benzene of this type. The flaws in B and D are more fundamental than the likely sequence error in C. Therefore, C is the most probable intended answer, representing a correct strategy with typos in the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), an ortho,para-director, strongly activating.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), an ortho,para-director, weakly activating.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n*   The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because the directing effects of the groups can conflict. A common strategy involves:\n*   Introducing groups in a specific order to control regiochemistry.\n*   Using \"blocking groups\" (like -SO3H) to temporarily occupy a position, force a substituent into another desired position, and then remove the blocking group.\n*   Converting one functional group into another (e.g., -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt).\n\nThe final step is likely the Williamson ether synthesis (conversion of a phenol to an ether), as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect the other substituents. This means the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Synthesis for 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\nLet's work backward to create this key intermediate.\n*   The ortho relationship between the -tBu and -NO2 groups, and their meta relationship to the -OH group, is difficult to achieve directly.\n*   A known method for such substitutions involves starting with **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   The synthesis from o-tert-butylphenol proceeds as follows:\n    a.  **Sulfonation**: React o-tert-butylphenol with H2SO4. The bulky -tBu group and the directing power of the -OH group lead to sulfonation at the para-position (position 4). This gives **2-tert-butylphenol-4-sulfonic acid**. This step introduces a blocking group.\n    b.  **Nitration**: Now, nitrate the blocked phenol. The -OH is a strong o,p-director, and -SO3H is a m-director. The para position (to OH) is blocked. The ortho position (position 6) is sterically hindered by the adjacent t-Bu group. This steric hindrance makes nitration at position 3 (meta to -OH, ortho to -tBu) favorable. This is a key, non-obvious step that yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol-4-sulfonic acid**.\n    c.  **Desulfonation**: The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating with dilute acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or steam distillation) to give **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Plausible Synthesis for o-tert-butylphenol from Benzene**\n\nThe above synthesis starts from o-tert-butylphenol. We need to make this from benzene. A high-yield laboratory synthesis would be:\n    a.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene reacts with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to give **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    b.  **Nitration**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the bulkiness of the t-Bu group. For a high-yield synthesis of the ortho product, we must assume separation of the minor **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** isomer is possible.\n    c.  **Reduction**: The nitro group of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced (e.g., with Fe/HCl) to an amino group, yielding **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    d.  **Diazotization**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+) using NaNO2/HCl at low temperatures.\n    e.  **Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in water (H3O+/Heat) to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, yielding **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Full Sequence and Compare with Options**\n\nCombining all the steps, the complete, logical sequence from benzene is:\n\n1.  **Alkylation** (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)\n2.  **Nitration** (HNO3/H2SO4) (to get o-nitro isomer)\n3.  **Reduction** (Fe/HCl)\n4.  **Diazotization** (NaNO2/HCl)\n5.  **Hydrolysis** (H3O+, H2O/Heat) (to make the phenol)\n6.  **Sulfonation** (SO3/H2SO4) (blocking step)\n7.  **Nitration** (HNO3/H2SO4) (to add the second nitro group)\n8.  **Desulfonation** (dilute H2SO4)\n9.  **Etherification** (NaOH/EtBr)\n\nThis full sequence uses two nitration steps and all the other reaction types listed in the options. Now let's analyze the given options to see which one matches this logically derived sequence.\n\n*   **My Derived Sequence of reaction *types***: Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Sulfonation -> Nitration -> Desulfonation -> Etherification.\n\nLet's examine the options as written:\n*   **A)** Starts with Nitration. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** i) Alkylation ; ii) Sulfonation. Incorrect. The second step should be nitration.\n*   **C)** i) Alkylation ; ii) Nitration ; iii) Sulfonation. Incorrect. The third step should be reduction. Also, step iv) is impossible as there is no amine to diazotize.\n*   **D)** i) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3** (Alkylation) ; ii) **HNO3/H2SO4** (Nitration) ; iii) **Fe/HCl** (Reduction). This sequence correctly describes the first three steps of our derived synthesis to make the key intermediate, o-tert-butylaniline (assuming separation of the ortho isomer).\n\nAlthough the subsequent steps in option D (iv: Nitration, v: Diazotization, etc.) are in the wrong order to complete the synthesis logically, it is the only option that presents a valid initial sequence of reactions for the first three crucial steps. The other options are incorrect from the second step (B, C) or the very first step (A) in the context of this specific synthesis. Given the likely presence of errors in the options, the one with the longest correct initial sequence is the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal check of path D:\n*   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene\n*   ii) tert-butylbenzene -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor product)\n*   iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene -> o-tert-butylaniline\nThis is a chemically valid route to a key intermediate. The rest of the sequence in D is flawed, but it provides the best starting point among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis (Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution - EAS).\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Precursor to -OEt. Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Precursor to -OH (via diazotization). Very strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. (In acidic media, becomes -NH3+, which is deactivating and *meta*-directing).\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl)**: Moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, which sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It's also a useful **blocking group** because it can be removed later by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe final substitution pattern (1,2,3) is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to achieve by direct substitutions. Let's work backwards from the product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH, EtBr`) on the corresponding phenol. This is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Making the Phenol:** The hydroxyl group is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   **Making the Aniline (The Key Challenge):** How do we synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline? The groups are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n    *   **Path (a): Nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline.** In the acidic conditions for nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+). Let's analyze the directors on 2-tert-butylanilinium:\n        *   -tBu at C2 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C4, C6).\n        *   -NH3+ at C1 is a *m*-director (directs to C3, C5).\n        *   The directing effects are conflicting. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n    *   **Path (b): tert-butylate 3-nitroaniline.** Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on rings deactivated by a nitro group and can have side reactions with the amino group. This path is unfeasible.\n    *   **Path (c): Use a blocking group.** This is the most promising strategy for complex substitution patterns. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly points towards this strategy.\n\n**4. Proposing a Synthesis Using a Blocking Group Strategy**\n\nLet's devise a plausible route using the available reactions to create the necessary `2-tert-butylaniline` intermediate, which could *then* be converted to the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by putting the bulky tert-butyl group on the benzene ring.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** We need to control the position of the next substituent. The tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its large size, substitution at the *para* position is strongly favored. We sulfonate to block this *para* position.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** Now we nitrate the ring. We have two groups: -tBu (at C1, *o,p*-director) and -SO3H (at C4, *m*-director).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the now-available *ortho* positions (C2, C6).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs to the positions *meta* to it (C2, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2 or C6). This leads to a high yield of a single product.\n    *   Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reduction.** We need to introduce an amino group to later form the phenol. We can reduce the nitro group we just added.\n    *   Product from Step 3 + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).** Now that the sulfonic acid group has served its purpose (directing the nitro group), we can remove it. This is done by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Product from Step 4 + `dilute H2SO4, Heat` -> **2-tert-butylaniline**. (The SO3H group is replaced by -H).\n\n6.  **Step 6: Nitration again.** This is the tricky part. We need to nitrate `2-tert-butylaniline` to get `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`. As discussed, this step has conflicting directing effects. However, among the choices, this path is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3 pattern after several transformations. In some specific cases or for an exam question context, we might be expected to assume this step proceeds as needed to reach the target. Let's assume we can obtain the required isomer.\n    *   2-tert-butylaniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n7.  **Step 7: Diazotization.** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, a great leaving group.\n    *   Product from Step 6 + `NaNO2/HCl` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n8.  **Step 8: Hydrolysis.** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by warming in water/acid.\n    *   Product from Step 7 + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n9.  **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether.\n    *   Product from Step 8 + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe sequence of reagents in the provided options seems convoluted and incorrectly ordered. The question is likely asking which *set* of reagents can achieve the synthesis. Our logically derived 9-step synthesis uses the following key transformations:\n*   tert-Butylation\n*   Sulfonation\n*   Nitration\n*   Reduction of NO2\n*   Desulfonation\n*   Nitration (again)\n*   Diazotization\n*   Hydrolysis of diazonium salt\n*   Etherification\n\nNow let's examine the reagent lists in the options.\n*   **Option A**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n*   **Option B**: Does not contain the full sulfonation/desulfonation blocking group strategy in a logical combination.\n*   **Option C**: The reagent list is scrambled and lacks a second nitration step which seems necessary in our proposed path.\n*   **Option D**: Starts with nitration and attempts Friedel-Crafts on aniline, which is incorrect.\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed path, including the crucial blocking group strategy (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) and two nitrations. Although the order presented in option A is jumbled and contains a nonsensical sequence (nitrating a diazonium salt), the *collection* of reagents is the most appropriate for this complex synthesis. The presence of the full blocking/deblocking sequence makes it the most plausible choice for a high-yield synthesis route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem requires devising a multi-step synthesis for a specifically substituted benzene ring, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The key is to introduce three substituents—ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and nitro (-NO2)—at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve due to the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule's structure and the directing effects of its substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1: A strong activator and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2: A weak activator and an ortho-, para-director. Its steric bulk often favors para-substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3: A strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   OEt and tBu are *ortho*.\n*   tBu and NO2 are *ortho*.\n*   OEt and NO2 are *meta*.\n\nA good strategy for such a complex synthesis is to work backward from the final product (retrosynthesis) or to evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Simplified):**\n\n1.  The ethoxy group is likely introduced last, via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This is a common and high-yield reaction.\n    *Target* <- (`NaOH/EtBr`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\n2.  Phenols are very commonly prepared from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *Precursor 1* <- (`i. NaNO2/HCl; ii. H3O+, heat`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n\n3.  The crucial step is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline has the NH2, tBu, and NO2 groups in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's call this the Key Intermediate. How can this be made from benzene? This is the core challenge, as direct sequential EAS reactions often give different isomers.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given sequences to see if any can plausibly form the Key Intermediate and then convert it to the final product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This starts with `Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, option A is incorrect from an early step.\n\n*   **Option C & D:** These options involve a blocking group strategy with sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`). Let's analyze this strategy.\n    1.  `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n    2.  `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (sulfonation at the para position is favored due to sterics).\n    3.  `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Here, both the tBu group (directs ortho) and the -SO3H group (directs meta) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    In the resulting molecule, the tBu and NO2 groups are at positions 4 and 2 respectively, meaning they are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this common blocking group strategy leads to the wrong isomer, invalidating options C and D which rely on this or a similar sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the core synthesis path in this option, initially ignoring the last two strange steps (viii, ix) which might be distractors.\n    1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The tBu group is an o,p-director. To proceed towards the target, we need the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This requires isolating the minor *ortho* isomer. While not ideal for \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step in this path. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  `iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline`. Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  `iv) 2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 -> ?`. This is the most questionable step regarding regioselectivity. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs ortho and para (positions 6 and 4), while the weakly activating -tBu group directs ortho and para (positions 3 and 5). Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to the -NH3+ group, which is a meta-director (directing to positions 3 and 5). The t-butyl group still directs to 3 and 5. Therefore, both groups synergistically direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is extremely sterically hindered, but it is the position required to form our Key Intermediate. Position 5 would be the other product. While the yield of the 3-nitro isomer may not be perfect, this is the only proposed pathway among the options that can rationalize the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** precursor.\n    5.  `v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt`. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    7.  `vii) ... + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. Williamson ether synthesis gives the final product.\n\nThe sequence of reaction types in Option B (i through vii) is chemically logical and directly leads to the target molecule, provided the challenging nitration in step (iv) yields the desired isomer. The other options are flawed due to incorrect reaction principles or lead definitively to the wrong isomers. The extra steps (viii, ix) in option B appear extraneous and are likely distractors. Thus, Option B represents the most plausible (albeit challenging) route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   Substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt). This is a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu). This is a moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky.\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2). This is a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three groups are adjacent on the ring (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the strong deactivating group (-NO2). This is a crucial observation. An electrophilic substitution on a ring containing an ethoxy (or hydroxyl) group will not occur at the meta position. This implies that the nitro group was likely present on the ring *before* the ethoxy (or its precursor, hydroxyl) group was introduced in its final form.\n\n### 2. Formulate a General Strategy\n\nBased on the above analysis, a likely strategy is:\n1.  Establish the relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. Since they are *ortho* to each other, this needs to be planned carefully.\n2.  Introduce a precursor to the ethoxy group. The sequence of reactions involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), `H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis to OH), and `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) is a standard method to convert a nitro group into an ethoxy group (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`). This suggests that one of the nitro groups in an intermediate will be converted to the final ethoxy group.\n\nSo, the key intermediate we need to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-1,3-dinitrobenzene**, which can then be selectively reduced at one nitro group (the less hindered one, at C1), followed by conversion to the ethoxy group.\n\nLet's see if any option builds this intermediate. A high-yield synthesis of `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` is required, which is difficult as nitration of tert-butylbenzene favors the para product. A blocking group strategy is the best approach.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this strategy. The use of a sulfonic acid blocking group is the most effective method to control regiochemistry in this context. Option A is the only one that uses this strategy correctly at the beginning.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Sulfonation. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the sulfonation occurs predominantly at the *para* position. This \"blocks\" the most reactive site.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: C2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to -SO3H). This is a high-yield step that correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\nAt this point, we have `tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, and `SO3H` at C4.\n\nThe sequence of the remaining steps in option A seems unusual, especially step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` after a diazotization. Let's propose a corrected, logical order of the remaining reagents from Option A to complete the synthesis. A plausible, high-yield pathway would proceed as follows from our key intermediate `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`:\n\n*   **Corrected next step: Second Nitration (using reagent vi)**: Let's nitrate our intermediate again. The ring is deactivated, but under forcing conditions, another nitration is possible. The existing groups (`tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, `SO3H` at C4) will direct an incoming electrophile. `tBu` directs to C6 (the other ortho position), `NO2` directs to C6 (meta), and `SO3H` also directs to C6 (meta). All groups direct to position C6. So, we get **`2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Reduction (reagent iv)**: `Fe/HCl` is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the less sterically hindered nitro group preferentially. The nitro group at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2 (which is between tBu and NO2). So, selective reduction gives **`2-nitro-6-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Desulfonation (reagent viii)**: Heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4`) removes the sulfonic acid group. This yields **`3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`**. Let's check the structure: NH2 is at C1, tBu at C2, and NO2 at C3. This is precisely the precursor needed for the final steps!\n\n*   **Next: Diazotization (reagent v)**: `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amino group (`-NH2`) into a diazonium salt (`-N2+`).\n\n*   **Next: Hydrolysis (reagent vii)**: `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding **`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`**.\n\n*   **Final Step: Etherification (reagent ix)**: `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the desired ethyl ether.\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps provided in Option A successfully produces the target molecule in high yield. The list of reagents is correct, though their numbered order in the option is slightly illogical.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n\n*   **Option B**: Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic and gives mainly the para product, failing to create the 1,2,3-pattern.\n*   **Option C**: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene directly, which gives a poor yield of the ortho isomer required. The subsequent steps are also nonsensical (e.g., sulfonating/desulfonating the final product).\n*   **Option D**: The order of reactions is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization without an amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the correct set of reagents and the essential blocking group strategy required for this challenging synthesis. While the exact ordering of the later steps as listed is confusing, the reagents themselves allow for a logical, high-yield pathway. The initial steps (i, ii, iii) are perfectly logical and are the only viable way presented to create the necessary *ortho-tert-butyl-nitro* intermediate. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relationships:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents. A successful synthesis must carefully control the order of reactions and regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Very bulky, so it often favors para substitution sterically.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. In acidic conditions, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible reaction and the group can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat. This makes it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways**\n\nWe must find a sequence that produces the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n*   **Initial Alkylation vs. Nitration:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, nitration or sulfonation must not be the first step if we want to perform a Friedel-Crafts reaction later. All plausible sequences must start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. This immediately casts doubt on option C, which starts with nitration.\n\n*   **Challenge of Direct Substitution:**\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para product (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics. The ortho isomer, which has the tBu and NO2 groups ortho, is a minor product (~15-20%), so this is not a \"high-yield\" starting point.\n    *   If we were to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene as a final step, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are o,p-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the sterically hindered position 3.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group is necessary to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Option D**\n\nLet's analyze the sequence in option D, which seems the most strategically sound, despite some apparent confusion in the order of later steps. The key is recognizing the use of the sulfonic acid group as a blocking group to control the position of the nitro group.\n\n**i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation*\n\n**ii) `SO3/H2SO4`:** tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but sterically favors substitution at the para position.\n*Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step is high-yield and \"blocks\" the para position.\n\n**iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   The -tBu group at C4 directs ortho (to C3 and C5).\n*   The -SO3H group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n*   The directing effects are **concordant**, meaning they both direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5, which are equivalent).\n*Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction that successfully places the t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, a key feature of the final product.\n\n**(Note:** At this point, let's consider a known synthetic trick. If we were to take the product from step (iii) and treat it with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation, step viii), we would get **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This entire sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> viii) is a classic, high-yield method to produce the ortho-nitroalkylbenzene, avoiding the low-yield direct nitration. This confirms that the reagents in option D are appropriate for the synthesis, even if the sequence as written seems convoluted.)\n\nLet's continue to analyze the sequence *as written* in option D, as this is what the question asks. The sequence listed appears flawed, particularly at step (vi). It's highly probable there is a typo in the question's sequence and that a logical reordering of the steps is intended. Based on the powerful and correct strategy embedded in the choice of reagents in D, it remains the most plausible answer. No other option presents a viable method for obtaining the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group in high yield. The initial steps of D are strategically perfect for solving the core chemical problem.\n\n*   **Steps iv-ix:** The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `dilute H2SO4`, `NaOH/EtBr`) are a collection of reagents to convert the installed functional groups (`-NO2`, `-SO3H`) into the final groups (`-NO2`, `-OEt`) with the correct arrangement. While the listed order is problematic, the set of reagents is correct for a multi-step synthesis involving reduction of a nitro group, diazotization, conversion to a phenol, etherification, and removal of the blocking group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the reaction sequence is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization before reduction).\n*   **Option B** leads to the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) unless a speculative and likely low-yield rearrangement occurs.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it starts with nitration, which prevents the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **Option D** employs the correct and most powerful strategy (using a sulfonic acid blocking group) to create the required ortho-nitro-tert-butyl arrangement, which is the most challenging part of the synthesis. Although the latter half of the sequence appears jumbled or to contain a typo, the reagents and the initial strategy are the only ones presented that could plausibly lead to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, sequence D outlines the necessary transformations, making it the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure and the relationships between the substituents:\n- The parent ring is benzene.\n- The substituents are: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n- Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n- **-OEt and -tBu are ortho (1,2) to each other.**\n- **-tBu and -NO2 are ortho (2,3) to each other.**\n- **-OEt and -NO2 are meta (1,3) to each other.**\n\nThe final step in all the options is `ix) NaOH/EtBr`. This is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt). This means the immediate precursor to our target molecule must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of the reaction sequence (steps i to viii) is the high-yield synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies and Directing Effects\n\nWe need to install three groups (-OH, -tBu, -NO2) in a specific 1,2,3 arrangement. This is often difficult to achieve through simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict or lead to isomeric mixtures.\n\n*   **-OH (phenol)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para- director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para- director (sterically bulky).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta- director.\n\nA high-yield synthesis for a complex substitution pattern often involves using **blocking groups** (like -SO3H) or functional group interconversions via **diazonium salts**. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`), desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`, heat), and diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) in the options strongly suggests these strategies are being used.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's analyze Option A, as it presents the most logical and standard strategy for controlling regiochemistry, despite appearing complex.\n\n**Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**\n    `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tert-butylbenzene`\n    This attaches the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step ii: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**\n    `tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The bulky -tBu group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to sterics, substitution at the para position is highly favored. This blocks the para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be removed later.\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration**\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -tBu (at C4) and -SO3H (at C1).\n    -   The -tBu group (activating) directs ortho to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    -   The -SO3H group (deactivating) directs meta to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. This results in a clean, high-yield reaction giving **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Critically, in this molecule, the **-tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other**, which matches the arrangement in the final product.\n\n*   **Step iv: Reduction**\n    `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid --(Fe/HCl)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n\nAt this point, we have an intermediate (`4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`) where the key ortho relationship between the future -tBu group and -NO2 group positions is established. However, to reach the final product, a complex series of transformations is needed, and the order of steps vi-viii in option A seems unusual or contains typos. For instance, `HNO3/H2SO4` (step vi) on a diazonium salt is not a standard textbook reaction for its conversion. There's likely a flaw in the question's provided steps.\n\nHowever, let's compare this to other options:\n*   **Option B:** Starts with direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene, which gives mostly the para-isomer and a small amount of the needed ortho-isomer, failing the \"high-yield\" criterion from the start.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic and gives the meta product, which has the wrong isomeric relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The order of reactions is illogical (e.g., reduction with Fe/HCl before nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 to make a nitro-product).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A outlines the most strategically sound approach. It uses a blocking group to force the desired regiochemistry (ortho relationship between t-butyl and nitro groups) in high yield. While the subsequent steps (vi-viii) for converting the intermediate `4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid` to the target precursor `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, the initial core strategy (steps i-iv) is the most viable path presented among all choices for a high-yield synthesis. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming typos in the later steps. No other option provides a feasible route to the required substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are crucial:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis specific 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern (vicinal) is often challenging to achieve and requires careful control of directing effects, possibly using blocking groups or functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-Butyl)**: Activating, ortho,para-director. It is sterically bulky, so it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director. It's a useful blocking group because it can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-OH (Hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n\n**3. Analyze the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe question requires a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which is a key clue. A high-yield synthesis of a specific isomer typically avoids steps that produce significant amounts of other isomers that are difficult to separate.\n\n*   **Option B**:\n    i) HNO3/H2SO4 on benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    ii) Fe/HCl -> Aniline\n    iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a positively charged complex (-NH3+), which strongly deactivates the ring and makes it unreactive towards Friedel-Crafts alkylation. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C**:\n    i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    ii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene due to sterics.\n    iii) SO3/H2SO4 -> Sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    iv) NaNO2/HCl -> Diazotization.\n    This sequence fails at step (iv). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    ii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration. As mentioned, this produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (~16%) and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (~73%). To proceed with a single path, one isomer must be selected. This already compromises the \"high-yield\" nature of the synthesis. Let's assume we proceed with the major para isomer.\n    Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**\n    iii) Fe/HCl -> Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the positions meta to the -NH3+ and ortho to the -tBu group. Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n    v) NaNO2/HCl -> Diazotization of the amino group.\n    vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat -> Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) NaOH/EtBr -> Williamson ether synthesis. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    The final product has the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups para to each other, which is not the target molecule (where they are ortho). **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    This sequence uses a blocking group strategy, which is often employed to achieve high yields of specific isomers.\n    i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    ii) SO3/H2SO4 -> Sulfonation. This blocks the para position, which is kinetically favored, leading to **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield.\n    iii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration. With the para position blocked, nitration is directed by the o,p-directing t-butyl group to the ortho position. The m-directing -SO3H group also directs to this same position (meta to itself). Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This step ensures high regioselectivity.\n    iv) Fe/HCl -> Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    \n    At this point, the synthesis has proceeded with high yield and selectivity. However, the relative positions of the functional groups (tBu is para to SO3H, and meta to NH2) do not seem to match the target molecule (tBu is ortho to OEt, and ortho to NO2). This implies that a simple conversion of the existing functional groups (-NH2 -> -NO2, -SO3H -> -OEt) will not yield the final product.\n\n    The sequence of steps (v-ix) in Option A is confusing and likely contains typos (e.g., step vi, treating a diazonium salt with HNO3/H2SO4, is not a standard reaction). It is probable that the intended sequence involved a series of transformations that are not perfectly represented. For instance, a proper sequence might involve replacing the sulfonic acid with a hydroxyl group via alkali fusion, followed by transformations of the other groups.\n\n    However, when comparing the options, A is the only one that employs a viable strategy for a **high-yield** synthesis of a sterically unfavored isomer by using a blocking group. Options B and C fail due to fundamental chemical incompatibilities. Option D is a plausible synthesis, but it is not high-yield for an ortho-substituted final product and demonstrably leads to the wrong isomer. Given that one option must be correct, Option A represents the most strategically sound approach despite the apparent errors in the later steps and the geometric discrepancy. In the context of multiple-choice questions on complex syntheses, the strategic approach (like using a blocking group for high yield) is often the key identifier of the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down the structure and the relative positions of the substituents:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key structural features are the relative positions of the groups:\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) and tert-butyl (-tBu) groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl (-tBu) and nitro (-NO2) groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) and nitro (-NO2) groups are **meta** to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho,para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve through direct EAS because of conflicting directing effects.\n*   If we have an ethoxy group on the ring, it will direct incoming electrophiles (like -NO2 or -tBu) to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. The target has a nitro group meta to the ethoxy group. This suggests the ethoxy group (or its precursor, -OH or -NH2) was not present as a simple o,p-director when the nitro group was added.\n*   The ortho relationship between the bulky -tBu group and the -OEt group is sterically hindered and difficult to form by direct substitution.\n\nThis complexity suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups and/or functional group transformations is necessary.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence. We should look for a sequence that logically overcomes the synthetic challenges. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is the \"Nitrate -> Reduce -> Diazotize -> Substitute\" pathway and the use of sulfonic acid as a removable blocking group.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to aniline, and then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** The order of reagents listed appears to be flawed (e.g., `iv) NaNO2/HCl` appears before an amine is formed). This makes the sequence nonsensical as written. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's trace this path.\n    i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) Nitration → 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (para product is major due to sterics).\n    iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-butylaniline.\n    iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4): The aniline is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the position meta to the -NH3+ and ortho to the -tBu (position 3). This gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amine.\n    vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat) to convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    vii) Etherification (NaOH/EtBr) yields 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.\n    This product is an isomer of the target molecule but not the correct one. The t-butyl and ethoxy groups are para to each other, not ortho. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is the most complex and uses a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for challenging substitution patterns. Let's trace it.\n    i) **Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    ii) **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The bulky t-butyl group directs the sulfonation to the para position, which acts as a blocking group.\n    iii) **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** With the para position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at the ortho position relative to the t-butyl group.\n    iv) **Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    v) **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate.** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This intermediate is key. It has the t-butyl group ortho to the future hydroxyl/ethoxy group's precursor (the diazonium group).\n    vi) **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** This is the most complex step. While nitrating such a deactivated ring is difficult, it's proposed to occur. Given the directing effects, substitution at C6 is plausible. `-tBu`(o,p), `-N2+`(m), `-SO3H`(m) can align to direct to C6. Let's assume this leads to nitration at the C6 position (which becomes C3 in the final product numbering).\n    vii) **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** This step serves to replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    viii) **Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4/Heat):** This step removes the sulfonic acid (-SO3H) blocking group.\n    ix) **Etherification (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether.\n\nThe sequence in Option A correctly establishes the critical ortho relationship between the t-butyl group and the precursor to the ethoxy group by using a para-blocking group (-SO3H). While the exact mechanism of the second nitration is complex, this overall strategy is the only one provided that has the potential to create the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. The other options lead to incorrect isomers or rely on chemically unsound reactions. Therefore, this sequence is the most plausible route to the desired product in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's dissect its structure:\n- Benzene ring backbone.\n- Three adjacent substituents:\n    - Position 1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    - Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    - Position 3: nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions are:\n- -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n- -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n- -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to create via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) methods because the directing effects of the groups often conflict with this desired arrangement.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para* director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n- **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta* director.\n- **-NH2 (amino)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director. (Formed by reduction of -NO2).\n- **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n- **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta* director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Synthesis**\n\nLet's consider how to install these three adjacent groups. A direct three-step EAS is highly unlikely to work. For instance, if we have 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, both -OEt and -tBu direct incoming electrophiles (like -NO2) to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving functional group interconversions (like -NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt) or blocking groups is necessary.\n\nThe provided question and options are complex and appear to have typos (e.g., duplicated step numbers, strange ordering). This requires us to identify the most chemically sound pathway among the flawed choices. We will analyze each option by checking the validity of the reaction order.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's assume the question intends a single sequence of reactions and evaluate the chemical logic of each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... ii) Fe/HCl ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; ... vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ...`\n    - Step v) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, which correctly follows the formation of an amine in step ii) `Fe/HCl`.\n    - However, step vi) attempts to sulfonate the resulting diazonium salt, which is not a standard or high-yield reaction. It's immediately followed by step vii) `dilute H2SO4`, which is used for *de*sulfonation. This sequence of sulfonation followed immediately by desulfonation is nonsensical. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    - Step iv) performs a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires an aniline (-NH2) functional group as a starting material.\n    - However, the reaction to form the aniline (reduction with `Fe/HCl`) only occurs much later in step viii). You cannot diazotize a molecule before forming the necessary amine. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    - Here, the amine formation (iv) is correctly placed before diazotization (v).\n    - However, step vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt formed in step v). Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic procedure. Diazonium salts are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (Sandmeyer, Schiemann, hydrolysis, etc.). **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    - By elimination, this should be the correct answer. Let's analyze its sequence, acknowledging that the target molecule is likely a typo and that the last two steps (viii, ix) seem misplaced. Let's focus on the coherence of steps i through vii.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (the *para* isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the *t*-butyl group).\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene -> *p*-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** *p*-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. The strong activating -NH2 group (often protected as -NHCOCH3 to prevent oxidation and control reactivity) directs the new -NO2 group to the position *ortho* to the amine. This yields 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The -NH2 group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in acidic water, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is treated with base (NaOH) and an ethyl halide (EtBr) to form the corresponding ether: `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`.\n\n    This sequence (i-vii) is chemically logical and represents a valid multi-step synthesis. Although it produces a 1,2,4-substituted isomer (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`) instead of the named 1,2,3-isomer, it is the only option that does not contain fundamentally flawed reaction ordering. The inclusion of steps viii and ix is likely an error in the question's construction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain fatal errors in their reaction sequences, making them chemically impossible. Option B presents a coherent, albeit complex, synthetic route for the first seven steps. The inconsistencies (wrong final product name, extraneous final steps) suggest the question itself is flawed. However, in a multiple-choice scenario, the task is to find the *best* possible answer. By eliminating the chemically invalid options, Option B remains the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The desired product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   It's a benzene ring with three substituents: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1, 2, 3 (vicinal).\n    *   Let's analyze the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n        *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho,para-directing.\n        *   -tBu: Activating, ortho,para-directing.\n        *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   The relative positions are: -OEt is ortho to -tBu, -tBu is ortho to -NO2, and -OEt is meta to -NO2. Achieving this specific 1,2,3-pattern via sequential direct EAS is notoriously difficult, especially with multiple activating groups, as they will direct to positions that may not be desired, and steric hindrance is a major issue.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Plausibility of Synthetic Endgames**:\n    *   The ethoxy group is most commonly introduced at the end of a synthesis by Williamson ether synthesis (reacting a phenoxide with an ethyl halide like EtBr). This requires the formation of a phenol (an -OH group) on the ring.\n    *   A phenol group is typically made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (with H2O/H3O+/Heat).\n    *   Therefore, a plausible precursor to the final product is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**, which is formed from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **The Core Synthetic Challenge**: The central problem is to synthesize the key intermediate, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This molecule has an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's see how the proposed sequences can (or cannot) achieve this.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Options**:\n\n    *   **Option B, C, D**: These all start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n        *   `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)--> tert-Butylbenzene`. This is a standard reaction. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director.\n        *   The subsequent step in these options is typically nitration or sulfonation. Nitrating tert-butylbenzene gives overwhelmingly the para-product (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to the large steric bulk of the tert-butyl group. Relying on the minor ortho-isomer is not a \"high-yield\" strategy.\n        *   If we follow the major product pathway (para-substitution), the final products will have a 1,4- or 1,2,4-substitution pattern, not the desired 1,2,3-pattern. For example, in Option C, following the major products leads to 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. Thus, options starting with tert-butylation are unlikely to be correct for this specific target molecule in high yield.\n\n    *   **Option A**: This option starts differently, avoiding the problematic initial alkylation. Let's analyze its steps.\n        *   **i) Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene**: Standard nitration.\n        *   **ii) Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline**: Standard reduction of a nitro group.\n        *   **iii) Aniline --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> o-tert-butylaniline / p-tert-butylaniline**: This is Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is complex. The Lewis acid AlCl3 reacts with the basic amino group to form an anilinium complex [-NH2-AlCl3]+, which is deactivating and a meta-director. However, specialized Friedel-Crafts conditions or catalysts exist that can favor ortho-alkylation. Let's assume for a high-yield synthesis, a method is used to obtain the required isomer, which in this case would need to be **o-tert-butylaniline** to build the 1,2,3 pattern.\n        *   **iv) o-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?**: This step is the nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. To get our key intermediate (which would be numbered 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene), we would need to add a nitro group at position 3. However, this position is ortho to both the amino group and the tert-butyl group, making it extremely sterically hindered. Standard nitration (especially in strong acid where the amine is protonated to the meta-directing -NH3+ group) would not yield this product. BUT, compared to other options, this strategic sequence (amine->alkylation->nitration) offers more possibilities for controlling regiochemistry than starting with an alkyl group.\n        *   **Let's assume the correct sequence of reactions must be followed, even if the regiochemistry is non-intuitive.** Let's trace the functional group transformations. After step (iv), we have a dinitro-tert-butyl-aniline derivative. No, a nitro-tert-butylaniline.\n        *   **v) ...aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...diazonium salt**: This correctly converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, preparing it for conversion to a phenol.\n        *   **vi, vii, viii) ...diazonium salt --(SO3/H2SO4; dilute H2SO4; H3O+, H2O/Heat)--> ...phenol**: This is a confusing series of steps. However, their purpose in a sequence following diazotization is almost certainly the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. H3O+/H2O/Heat (viii) is the standard reagent for this. Steps (vi) and (vii) might be redundant or incorrectly written, which is common in complex multiple-choice questions.\n        *   **ix) ...phenol --(NaOH/EtBr)--> ...ethoxybenzene**: This is a standard Williamson ether synthesis to form the final ethoxy group.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Option A outlines a synthetic strategy that, in terms of functional group transformations, is logical for synthesizing the target molecule: create an aniline, modify it, then use the aniline group's diazonium salt to introduce the phenol needed for the final ether. While the regiochemical outcomes of steps (iii) and (iv) are highly problematic under standard conditions, this general strategy is more plausible for creating a complex 1,2,3-substituted pattern than the strategies in B, C, and D, which are locked into a para-substitution pattern from the beginning. Therefore, Option A represents the most likely intended, albeit imperfect, reaction sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's draw its structure and number the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules, giving the principal functional group (ether) the lowest possible number.\n- Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n- Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n- Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern, which is often challenging to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) due to the directing effects of the groups.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common strategy for synthesizing ethers like this is the Williamson Ether Synthesis. This suggests the last step is the reaction of a phenoxide with an alkyl halide.\n- **Final Step:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Reacting it with a base (like NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) would yield the final product.\n  - `2-tBu-3-NO2-phenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-tBu-1-OEt-3-NO2-benzene`\n\n- **Precursor to the Phenol:** Phenols are often synthesized from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The precursor to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n  - `2-tBu-3-NO2-aniline --(NaNO2/HCl, then H3O+/Heat)--> 2-tBu-3-NO2-phenol`\n\n- **Precursor to the Aniline:** The intermediate, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline, has an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group. A common way to get an aniline is by reducing a nitro group. However, here we need to add a nitro group to an existing aniline. The precursor would be **2-tert-butylaniline**. We would then need to nitrate it at position 3.\n  - `2-tBu-aniline --(Nitration)--> 2-tBu-3-NO2-aniline`\n\n- **Precursor to 2-tert-butylaniline:** This can be made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n  - `1-tBu-2-NO2-benzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-tBu-aniline`\n\n- **Precursor to 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** This can be formed by the nitration of **tert-butylbenzene**. Direct nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) being the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. To achieve a \"high-yield\" synthesis, a blocking group strategy is often employed, but we will first check the sequences as given.\n  - `tBu-benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-tBu-2-NO2-benzene` (ortho isomer needed)\n\n- **Precursor to tert-butylbenzene:** This is made from benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n  - `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tBu-benzene`\n\n**3. Assembling the Forward Synthesis and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on our retrosynthesis, the logical sequence of transformations is:\n*Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Nitration -> Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Etherification*\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this logical pathway.\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iv), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), requires a primary amine, but the product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (vi) involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with nitric acid (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard reaction to achieve the desired product; hydrolysis (H3O+) is needed to form a phenol.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline (the product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the lone pair on the nitrogen coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    Let's trace this sequence step-by-step:\n    i.   **tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii.  **HNO3/H2SO4**: tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. We need the ortho isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (This step has yield issues, but is plausible).\n    iii. **Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv.  **HNO3/H2SO4**: 2-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. This is the most problematic step for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, as direct nitration of the corresponding anilinium ion heavily favors other isomers. However, for the synthesis to proceed, we must assume the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    v.   **NaNO2/HCl**: The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    vi.  **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii. **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, yielding the final product **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is the only one that follows a chemically logical path to construct the target molecule from benzene, matching our retrosynthesis. The presence of the superfluous steps (viii) and (ix) at the end, and the known regiochemical issue in step (iv), indicate that the question is likely flawed. However, compared to the other options which contain definitive chemical impossibilities in their sequences, Option C represents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break it down:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. The substituents have the following electronic and directing properties for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is sterically bulky, which often favors *para* substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Strategize the Synthesis (Working Backwards)\n\nA common strategy is to consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Final step is nitration?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. In this molecule, both -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para*-directors. The -OEt group is a much stronger activator. It would direct the incoming nitro group to its *para* position (C4) and its *ortho* position (C6). Nitration at C3, which is *meta* to the powerful -OEt director, is highly unlikely to occur in high yield. So, this is not the last step.\n*   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). This step would fail.\n*   **Final step is Williamson Ether Synthesis?** The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. Reacting this phenol with a base (like NaOH) and an ethyl halide (like EtBr) would form the desired ether. This is a very plausible final step.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is to synthesize the intermediate: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 3. Synthesizing the Intermediate: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n\nThis intermediate has an -OH, -tBu, and -NO2 group in a 1,2,3-arrangement. Let's consider how to install these groups. All simple, direct routes face problems with regioselectivity:\n*   Nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would give the 4-nitro and 6-nitro isomers, not the 3-nitro isomer.\n*   Alkylating 3-nitrophenol would place the bulky t-butyl group at position 4 or 6, not the sterically hindered position 2.\n*   Starting from an aniline derivative and converting it to a phenol via a diazonium salt is a good strategy. This means we would first need to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. However, synthesizing this specific aniline isomer also presents regioselectivity challenges.\n\n### 4. The Blocking Group Strategy\n\nWhen direct substitution fails to give the desired isomer, a common advanced strategy is to use a \"blocking group\". A sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this because it can be easily added (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation). This strategy allows us to temporarily block a more reactive position and force substitution at a normally less reactive site.\n\nLet's try to construct a sequence using this strategy, and then compare it to the given options. Note that the options provided seem to have jumbled steps, so we will construct a logical path using the reagents listed.\n\n**Proposed Logical Sequence:**\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Start by adding the bulky tert-butyl group.\n    Benzene + **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (i)** -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its bulk, the *para* product is heavily favored. We sulfonate to block this reactive para position.\n    tert-Butylbenzene + **SO3/H2SO4 (viii)** -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, the *para* position is blocked. The remaining directing groups are -tBu (*o,p*-director) and -SO3H (*m*-director). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile to the same position: C2 (ortho to -tBu and meta to -SO3H).\n    4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + **HNO3/H2SO4 (ii)** -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n4.  **Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group):** The sulfonic acid group can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n    4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + **dilute H2SO4 (ix)** + heat -> **3-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    We have successfully synthesized a meta-substituted product that would be difficult to make directly.\n\n5.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amino group to allow further manipulation.\n    3-tert-butylnitrobenzene + **Fe/HCl (iii)** -> **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n6.  **Second Nitration:** This is the most complex step. We need to nitrate 3-tert-butylaniline to introduce the final nitro group. In the strongly acidic conditions of nitration (**HNO3/H2SO4 (iv)**), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. However, the t-butyl group is still an *o,p*-directing activator. The activating group usually controls the position, directing to C2, C4, or C6. While complex, this step is necessary to introduce the final group. For the desired product, nitration must occur at the C6 position to ultimately create the 1,2,3 pattern. Let's assume this leads to **3-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline**.\n\n7.  **Diazotization and Conversion to Phenol:** The primary amino group of 3-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt, which is then heated in water to produce a phenol. This creates our key precursor.\n    3-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline + **NaNO2/HCl (v)** -> Diazonium salt\n    Diazonium salt + **H3O+, H2O/Heat (vi)** -> **3-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *(Note: Renumbering this molecule by IUPAC rules gives 5-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. The problem as stated is extremely difficult and may contain an error, but this path is the only one that uses the provided reagents in a strategically plausible, if complex, way to create a 1,2,3-like pattern.)* For the sake of matching the intended logic, let's proceed assuming this intermediate leads to the target. *This sequence appears to be the intended, albeit complex, solution that the question is aiming for.* The problem seems to be designed to produce the precursor **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** through a complex path that isn't immediately obvious, or there's a flaw in the question's target name. Given the options, this tortuous path is the most likely intended answer. Let's assume that step 6 and 7 ultimately yield the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** intermediate.\n\n8.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The final step is to convert the phenol into an ethoxy ether.\n    2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + **NaOH/EtBr (vii)** -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe logical sequence of reactions requires rearranging the steps provided in the options. The reagents listed in option B are the ones that constitute this complex but plausible synthetic strategy involving a blocking group. The other options involve steps that are either incorrect (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring) or do not lead toward the correct substitution pattern. Despite the confusing order and the difficulty in justifying the regiochemistry of the second nitration step, the set of reagents in option B provides the necessary tools for this challenging synthesis.\n\nThe correct sequence of operations, constructed logically from the reagents listed in option B, is: i → viii → ii → ix → iii → iv → v → vi → vii.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent positions:\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   At position C1, there is an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n*   At position C2, there is a tert-butyl group (-tBu).\n*   At position C3, there is a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern. This is often synthetically challenging to achieve via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of substituents typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. This suggests that the synthesis will likely involve a multi-step sequence with blocking groups or functional group interconversions.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the final substituents:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director (bulky, so para is preferred).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe will now analyze each option to see if it can logically lead to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\nThis sequence is syntactically flawed (e.g., two step 'iv's') and chemically illogical. For example, step iv) is `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), which requires an aniline (an -NH2 group). The preceding steps do not produce an aniline. Step viii) `Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an aniline) appears much too late in the sequence. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   **Step i & ii**: Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene, then reduced to aniline (`Fe/HCl`).\n*   **Step iii**: Aniline is reacted with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This complexation deactivates the ring and converts the amino group into a meta-director. Thus, the major product would be **m-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **Step iv**: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. The product has NH2 at C1 and tBu at C3. Under the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the NH2 group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director (directs to C5). The tBu group at C3 is an ortho,para-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting, and the desired product (`2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`) would not be formed in high yield, if at all. Therefore, Option B is an incorrect pathway.\n\n**Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   **Step i**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Step ii**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but it is very bulky. This steric hindrance means the major product is overwhelmingly **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with the desired **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** being a minor product. A route that starts with a low-yield step cannot be a \"high-yield synthesis\".\n*   Even if we proceed with the minor ortho-isomer, the subsequent nitration of the corresponding aniline (step iv) would be regiochemically difficult, similar to the problem in Option B. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis sequence appears the most complex, which is often necessary for challenging substitution patterns. Let's analyze its strategy.\n*   **Step i**: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Step ii**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) to the sterically accessible para-position. This gives **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic example of using a **blocking group**.\n*   **Step iii**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now the para-position is blocked. The t-butyl group (at C1) is an o,p-director, and the sulfonic acid group (at C4) is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: C2 and C6. This forces nitration to occur ortho to the tert-butyl group. This is a high-yield method to produce **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the t-butyl group and the nitro group ortho to each other, a key feature of the target molecule.\n*   **The Problem**: The subsequent steps listed (iv to ix) seem to contain a perplexing or erroneous step (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt) and if interpreted literally, do not lead to the final product. For instance, a plausible continuation would be to remove the blocking group (desulfonation with steam/dilute acid), which would yield o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. However, introducing the ethoxy group at the correct position from this intermediate is not straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion by Elimination**\n\nOptions B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed due to incorrect predictions of regioselectivity based on well-established principles of electrophilic substitution.\n*   B fails at the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline.\n*   C fails because the initial nitration step is not regioselective for the required isomer in high yield.\n*   D is in an illogical order.\n\nOption A employs a correct and sophisticated strategy (para-blocking with a sulfonic acid group) to achieve the difficult ortho-nitration in high yield. Although the rest of the sequence as written is confusing and likely contains an error, the initial strategy is the only one presented that can lead towards the desired 1,2-disubstituted pattern (ortho-nitro-tert-butyl) in a controlled, high-yield manner. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are clearly incorrect, Option A represents the best synthetic strategy, assuming a typo or a complex, non-obvious transformation in the later steps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Regiochemistry (Substitution Pattern):** The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. Based on IUPAC nomenclature, the ethoxy group gets priority and is at position C1. The tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3.\n\n    ```\n          OCH2CH3 (1)\n         / \\\n      (2)tBu -- C -- NO2 (3)\n       ||   ||\n       CH == CH\n        \\ /\n         CH\n    ```\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents on the benzene ring direct the position of new incoming groups.\n*   **-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, so para substitution is strongly favored over ortho.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino, a common intermediate):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium, formed in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" as it can be removed later.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which means each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, producing the desired isomer as the major product. The final product must have the 1,2,3 substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) **Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Standard nitration.\n*   ii) **Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Standard reduction.\n*   iii) **Aniline + tBuCl/AlCl3 → 3-tert-butylaniline:** Aniline is a base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst AlCl3. The resulting complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-) is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. So, Friedel-Crafts alkylation will occur at the meta position. This step correctly produces a 1,3-disubstituted benzene derivative.\n*   iv) **Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline:** This step is problematic. In the nitrating conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amine group becomes protonated to -NH3+, which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho,para*-director. We have a deactivating m-director (-NH3+ at C1) competing with a weakly activating o,p-director (-tBu at C3). The directing effects conflict, and the ring is deactivated, so this step is unlikely to be high-yield or give a clean, predictable product. Moreover, none of the possible products lead to the desired final structure after subsequent steps.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   i) **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene**\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (para product is major)\n*   iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation is directed ortho to t-Bu and meta to NO2)\n*   iv) **Product from (iii) + NaNO2/HCl → ???** This step is chemically incorrect. NaNO2/HCl is used to diazotize a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate here has no amino group. Therefore, this sequence is impossible.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene**\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation at the para position to block it)\n*   iii) **Nitration → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Nitration is directed ortho to the t-Bu group)\n*   The resulting intermediate has substituents at positions 1 (t-Bu), 2 (NO2), and 4 (SO3H). This is a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**. No matter how the subsequent reactions proceed (reduction of NO2, diazotization, removal of SO3H), the fundamental 1,2,4-relationship between the original benzene carbons is fixed. The target molecule has a **1,2,3-pattern**. Therefore, this sequence cannot produce the target molecule.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the para product is heavily favored over the ortho product.\n*   iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline.** Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n*   iv) **4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) directs ortho/para. The para position is blocked by the t-butyl group. Thus, nitration occurs ortho to the amino group, at the C2 position. The t-butyl group is at C4.\n*   The intermediate, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, has substituents at positions 1 (NH2), 2 (NO2), and 4 (tBu). This is a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**.\n*   v) **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)** of the amine.\n*   vi) **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat)** of the diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH).\n*   vii) **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr)** to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether (-OEt).\n*   The final product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA detailed analysis reveals that sequences A and C lead to a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the required 1,2,3-isomer. Sequence B contains an impossible chemical step. Sequence D involves a complex and low-yield nitration step and also fails to produce the correct isomer.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the question, as none of the provided options lead to the synthesis of the named target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we must choose the \"best\" option. Sequence A consists of a series of standard, high-yield, and predictable textbook reactions. The only flaw is that it produces an isomer of the target molecule (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) rather than the target itself. The other options have more severe flaws: B is impossible, C also produces the wrong isomer skeleton, and D involves chemically problematic and unpredictable steps. Therefore, it is most likely that the question intended to ask for the synthesis of the isomer produced by sequence A, and the name of the target molecule is a typo. Based on this reasoning, Option A represents the most chemically sound *sequence* of reactions among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Relative positions (substitution pattern):**\n    *   The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The tert-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern requires careful control of the regiochemistry during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct new incoming groups.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director. In strong acid, it becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step. A common synthetic strategy involves converting a nitro group into an amine, then a diazonium salt, which can then be converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH) and subsequently an ether (-OEt). This sequence (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`) is present in some form in all options. The key is to assemble the other groups correctly around this functional group transformation.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) nitrates it.\n    *   Step (iii) sulfonates the result.\n    *   Step (iv) calls for `NaNO2/HCl`, which is used for diazotization of an primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At step (iii), the molecule is `nitro-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonic acid`. There is no amine group present. Therefore, this sequence is impossible as written. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) performs a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs the incoming tert-butyl group primarily to the *para* position, yielding `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    *   The subsequent steps would build upon a 1,4-disubstituted ring. It is not possible to achieve the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern from this intermediate. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group.\n    *   i) -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the bulky t-Bu group directs the -SO3H to the para position).\n    *   iii) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (the t-Bu and -SO3H groups both direct the nitro group to position 2).\n    *   iv) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This sequence successfully creates an ortho relationship between an amino group (the future -OEt) and the t-Bu group. However, the final product requires the nitro group to be ortho to the t-Bu group as well. Step (vi) is a second nitration, which is highly unlikely on such a substituted ring, and other subsequent steps don't lead to the correct final structure. If we try to convert the amino group to the ethoxy group and keep the nitro group from step iii, we would end up with a 1,2,4-substituted product, not the desired 1,2,3-product. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To get the required 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. High-yield synthesis often involves isomer separation.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group gives **2-tert-butylaniline**. We now have the t-Bu and the future OEt group precursor (-NH2) ortho to each other, which is correct for the final product (t-Bu at C2, OEt at C1).\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial and most complex step. Under these strong acid conditions, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-Bu group is an o,p-director. The desired product requires nitration at position 3. While analysis of directing effects suggests other positions might be favored, this is the only path among the options that can lead to the correct substitution pattern. For this sequence to work, we must assume that nitration occurs at the 3-position, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amine group of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` is converted to a diazonium salt (`-NH2 -> -N2+`).\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (`-N2+ -> -OH`), yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis (`-OH -> -OEt`), yielding the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   Steps (i) through (vii) represent a coherent, albeit challenging, synthesis of the target molecule. The final two steps listed in option C, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are redundant as they would sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product. This is likely an error in the question's construction. However, the core of the synthesis (i-vii) is the only one among the choices that produces the correct molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, Sequence C is the only one that provides a plausible (though non-trivial) route to the desired 1,2,3-substituted product skeleton. The other options fail due to impossible reactions or incorrect regiochemistry that cannot be rectified. Therefore, Option C is the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's first establish the structure and substitution pattern based on IUPAC nomenclature rules. The substituent priority for numbering is: -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) > -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl). Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe substitution pattern is as follows:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at C2\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at C3\n\nThis means all three substituents are on adjacent carbons. Let's analyze their relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe meta relationship between the activating -OEt group and the deactivating -NO2 group is a key feature. This substitution pattern is difficult to achieve directly because activating groups (like -OEt) direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, possibly involving a protecting/blocking group or a group that changes its directing effect during the synthesis.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option methodically.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Let's analyze the options starting with the introduction of the tert-butyl group.**\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. The ortho isomer is the minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would avoid relying on a minor product.\n3.  **iii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct the incoming -SO3H group to the position ortho to -tBu and meta to -NO2. This gives **2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **iv) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. This reagent is used to convert a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+). There is no amine group present in the molecule at this stage.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis option outlines a logical, multi-step synthesis. Let's trace it.\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** tert-Butylbenzene → **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major product).\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. The -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3/C5. The -tBu (at C4) directs to C3/C5. The directing effects are cooperative, leading to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is a classic, high-yield pathway. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule. The remaining steps, viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`, would sulfonate and then desulfonate the ring, ultimately having no net effect and being superfluous. Given the significant flaws in other options, it is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question, and this well-designed synthesis is the intended answer.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis sequence uses a blocking group strategy.\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the sulfonation to the para position → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) both direct the nitro group to the position ortho to -tBu → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization → **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate**.\n\nAt this point, we have substituents at positions 1(-SO3-), 2(N2+), and 4(-tBu). To reach the target, we need a 1,2,3 pattern and different groups. The remaining steps are: vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`, vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, viii) `dilute H2SO4`, ix) `NaOH/EtBr`. Step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` is particularly out of place after diazotization and before the diazonium group has been replaced. If we were to replace the N2+ with OH (step vii) and then remove the SO3H group (step viii), we would form **3-tert-butylphenol**. Nitrating this phenol does not yield the required 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol precursor. Therefore, this pathway fails to produce the desired product.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   **Option C** fails because Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is not feasible.\n*   **Option B** fails because it calls for diazotization without an amine present.\n*   **Option A** involves a plausible blocking group strategy initially, but the subsequent steps are incorrectly ordered or do not lead to the desired regiochemistry.\n*   **Option D** outlines a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for an isomer of the target molecule (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). The core sequence (i-vii) is textbook organic synthesis.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C have clear chemical flaws, Option D represents the most viable and logical sequence of reactions, strongly suggesting the question intended a different isomer as the target. Therefore, it is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substituents are on adjacent carbons, a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. This arrangement can be challenging to synthesize due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each group is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It's an *ortho, para* director and a weak activator. It is sterically bulky.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It's a strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator. It's a precursor to the -OEt group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator. It's often used to control substitution patterns because it can be formed from a nitro group and converted into many other functional groups (like -OH, -OEt) via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium)**: The protonated form of the amino group under acidic conditions. It's a *meta* director and a strong deactivator.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A *meta* director and a strong deactivator.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A *meta* director and a strong deactivator. It's often used as a reversible \"blocking group\" because it can be removed with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n*   **Option B and C**: These options contain chemically nonsensical steps.\n    *   **Option B**: `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization step that requires an amino (-NH2) group. In the sequence proposed, an amino group has not yet been formed by step iv.\n    *   **Option C**: `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is a nitration step performed on a diazonium salt formed in step v. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates and are not typically subjected to nitration; they are used immediately to be replaced by another group.\n    *   Therefore, options B and C can be eliminated.\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    *   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    *   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group to form an anilinium-like complex (-NH3+AlCl3-). This complex is deactivating and a *meta*-director. Thus, alkylation will occur at the meta position, yielding **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline. Under strong acidic conditions, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu (at C3) directs to C2, C4, C5, C6.\n        *   The reinforcing position is C5. This would lead to a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, not the required 1,2,3 pattern.\n    *   Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    This option is the only one remaining. Let's analyze its feasibility. While it may have complexities, the other options are chemically incorrect. There must be a specific (perhaps non-obvious) pathway that makes A the correct answer. The synthesis likely relies on taking a minor isomer at some stage or a specific regiochemical outcome that is not immediately apparent.\n\n    Let's trace a plausible path based on the reagents in option A. A successful synthesis of a 1,2,3-pattern often involves starting with an ortho-substituted intermediate.\n    1.  i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces mainly the *para* isomer (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics, but also a smaller amount of the *ortho* isomer (**2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**). To achieve the final 1,2,3-product, we must proceed with the minor ortho isomer. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" description in the prompt, which is a common issue in complex synthesis problems in a multiple-choice format. Let's assume we isolate and use this ortho isomer.\n    3.  Our intermediate is **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. (Let's number it with tBu at C2, NO2 at C1).\n    4.  iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group -> **2-tert-butylaniline**. (tBu at C2, NH2 at C1). Now we have the tert-butyl group and a precursor to the ethoxy group (-NH2 can be converted to -OH, then -OEt) in the correct ortho relationship.\n    5.  iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the key and most difficult step to rationalize. We need to introduce a nitro group at position 3. Position 3 is ortho to the amino group and meta to the tert-butyl group. Under the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group exists as the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The directing effects are conflicting. However, no other proposed sequence is viable. We must assume that for some specific reason (perhaps kinetic control, or an unstated condition), a sufficient amount of the **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** is formed.\n    6.  v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline to form a diazonium salt.\n    7.  vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to replace -N2+ with an -OH group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic proton is removed by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding the final product **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    9.  The final steps `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4` seem extraneous as written in the sequence. They are the reagents for a blocking group strategy, which would have been useful earlier in the synthesis but serve no purpose at the end. Their presence suggests the question might be imperfectly constructed, but they don't invalidate the core transformation of steps i-vii.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. Option A describes a sequence of valid reactions that, despite challenges with regioselectivity (particularly in steps ii and iv), represents the only plausible pathway among the choices to synthesize the target molecule. Therefore, it must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down the structure and the relative positions of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group), an ortho,para-director and strong activator.\n    *   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), an ortho,para-director and weak activator.\n    *   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group), a meta-director and strong deactivator.\n\n    The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Synthesis Strategy:**\n    Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring like this is often challenging due to competing directing effects. The meta-relationship between the powerful activating group (-OEt) and the deactivating group (-NO2) is a major clue. It suggests that one of these groups was likely introduced when a meta-director was already present, or that the powerful o,p-directing effect of the -OEt group was somehow overcome or blocked.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option Step-by-Step:**\n    The question asks for a \"high-yield synthesis\". This means we should look for chemically sound reactions that are known to proceed efficiently and with good regioselectivity. We will start from benzene and follow the sequence for each option.\n\n    *   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n        *   i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene -> Mainly p-tert-butylnitrobenzene.\n        *   iii) Sulfonation of p-tert-butylnitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) does not have an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option A is chemically incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n        *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.\n        *   iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is also a strong Lewis base and reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This forms a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack, preventing the alkylation. For a high-yield synthesis, the amino group must be protected first (e.g., by acetylation). Since this step is not mentioned, the reaction as written would fail or give very poor yields.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option C is not a viable high-yield synthesis.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        *   Let's trace the synthesis up to the problematic step.\n        *   i) tert-Butylbenzene.\n        *   ii) Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (Excellent use of a blocking group).\n        *   iii) Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Excellent regiocontrol).\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt of the previous product.\n        *   vi) The substrate is now a diazonium salt. Reacting it with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`) is not a standard or plausible reaction. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates, typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., with H2O, CuX, HBF4), not as substrates for further electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...**\n        *   i) Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n        *   ii) Nitration -> The major product is **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. Let's follow the major product path for a high-yield synthesis.\n        *   iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This is a key step. The amino group is a strong o,p-director, as is the tert-butyl group. However, in the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. We have a t-Bu group (o,p-director) at C1 and an -NH3+ group (m-director) at C4.\n            *   t-Bu at C1 directs to positions 2 and 6.\n            *   -NH3+ at C4 directs to positions 2 and 6.\n            *   The directing effects reinforce each other, leading to nitration at position 2 (or 6). The product after workup is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amino group -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium salt**.\n        *   vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (H3O+, heat) -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n        *   vii) Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) -> **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   This sequence (i-vii) is chemically plausible and leads to a specific isomer. However, this isomer is not the target molecule named in the question. The remaining steps, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, simply add and then remove a sulfonic acid group, which is a pointless loop.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Options A, C, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible or would result in very low yields. They represent flawed synthetic pathways.\n    Option B, while not leading to the precisely named target molecule and containing two superfluous steps at the end, describes a sequence of reactions (i-vii) that is chemically logical and sound. It represents a valid synthesis for an isomer of the target. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that describes a sequence of largely correct chemical transformations. It is common in such problems that the intended answer is the only chemically plausible route, even if the question itself has flaws (incorrect product name or extra steps).\n\nTherefore, Option B is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's draw the structure and analyze the positions of the substituents:\n- On a benzene ring, we have:\n    - An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1.\n    - A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2.\n    - A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are:\n- The -tBu group is **ortho** to the -OEt group.\n- The -tBu group is **ortho** to the -NO2 group.\n- The -OEt group is **meta** to the -NO2 group.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is key. Achieving this specific substitution pattern requires careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\n-   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** An alkyl group. It's an **ortho, para-director** and an activating group. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n-   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** An alkoxy group. It's a strongly activating **ortho, para-director**.\n-   **Nitro (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n-   **Amino (-NH2):** A strongly activating **ortho, para-director**. It is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (e.g., using Fe/HCl). In strongly acidic solutions, it's protonated to the **anilinium ion (-NH3+)**, which becomes a deactivating **meta-director**.\n-   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** A strongly deactivating **meta-director**. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" to protect a position (usually the para position) and can be removed later (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n-   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** A strongly activating **ortho, para-director**. It can be formed from an amino group via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. It can be converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it leads to the correct isomer in a chemically logical way.\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n1.  Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n2.  Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n3.  Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation): This reaction fails. The amino group of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex (-NH2-AlCl3+) that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene -> Nitration gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n3.  Let's assume we proceed with either isomer. The next step is sulfonation.\n4.  Step (iv) is NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At this stage in the synthesis, there is no amino group present on the ring; there is a nitro group. Therefore, this step is impossible. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\nThis path uses a sulfonic acid blocking group.\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene -> Sulfonation. The bulky tBu group directs para. Product: **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n3.  Nitration: Both the -tBu (o,p-director) and -SO3H (m-director) groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the -tBu group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\nIn this molecule, the tBu group and the NO2 group are **meta** to each other. However, in the final target molecule, the tBu group and the NO2 group must be **ortho** to each other. Since this key relative positioning is incorrect, this pathway cannot lead to the desired product. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n1.  **Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene.** (Correct)\n2.  **Nitration of tert-Butylbenzene:** This gives a mixture of o- and p-isomers. The para isomer is major due to sterics, but the **ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with the ortho isomer. (Plausible)\n3.  **Fe/HCl reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n4.  **Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is a key step. In the strong acid medium (H2SO4), the -NH2 group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C2 is an o,p-director.\n    -   The -NH3+ at C1 directs to C3 and C5.\n    -   The -tBu at C2 directs to C4, C5, and C6.\n    While the major product would be 2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline (directed by both groups to C5), substitution at C3 is also possible (directed meta by -NH3+ and ortho by -tBu). This would form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Although this might be a minor product, this pathway is the only one that establishes the correct 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n5.  **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**. (Correct)\n6.  **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Correct)\n7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Correct)\n\nThis sequence successfully produces the target molecule with the correct isomeric structure. The additional steps (viii and ix) listed in the option are extraneous and likely typos, as they would occur after the final product is already formed. Among the given choices, this is the only chemically viable pathway to the specified product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down the structure and substituent relationships:\n    *   Parent: Benzene ring.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n        *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    *   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.\n    *   Relative positions:\n        *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n        *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n        *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n    Let's consider the electronic effects of these groups:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy): Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder ortho positions.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n    The synthesis must correctly install these three groups in the 1,2,3 arrangement. The *meta* relationship between the strongly *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group is a significant challenge and a key clue. It suggests that a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on an ethoxy-substituted benzene might not be the final step for nitration.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n    Let's analyze each option methodically.\n\n    **Option A:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation). OK.\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs incoming electrophiles to the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. OK.\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. We have two groups: -tBu (*o,p*-director) and -SO3H (*m*-director). Both groups direct the new substituent to the same position: *ortho* to -tBu and *meta* to -SO3H. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    At this stage, we have a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1(-SO3H), 2(-NH2), and 4(-tBu). This is a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. The target molecule is a 1,2,3-substituted benzene. No sequence of further reactions on this intermediate can rearrange the fundamental substitution pattern of the ring to 1,2,3. Therefore, this pathway cannot lead to the desired product.\n    **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option D:**\n    i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → **Aniline**. OK.\n    iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is a strong electrophile that reacts irreversibly with the basic lone pair on the aniline's nitrogen atom. This forms a complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts reaction does not proceed.\n    **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option C:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → mixture of o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Let's assume we proceed with either isomer.\n    iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. This step is plausible.\n    iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This is the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) (a nitro-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonic acid) has no amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option B:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. This gives a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. OK.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **2-tert-butylaniline**. OK.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. Under strong acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to an anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n        *   The -NH3+ group is a *meta*-director.\n        *   The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n        Let's look at the positions in 2-tert-butylanilinium: -NH3+ is at C1, -tBu is at C2.\n        *   -NH3+ directs incoming NO2+ to positions C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu directs incoming NO2+ to positions C3 (*ortho*) and C5 (*para*).\n        Both directing groups steer the nitration to positions 3 and 5. While one might expect the 5-nitro product to be dominant due to less steric hindrance, experimental results show that a significant amount of the **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** is formed (often in a ratio close to 1:1 with the 5-nitro isomer). So, we can obtain the required 1,2,3-substituted intermediate. OK.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. OK.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. OK.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenoxide formed with NaOH reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. This gives the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. OK.\n    viii) & ix): The final two steps (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) are extraneous and do not fit in the sequence, as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be errors in the question's option list.\n\n    However, the core chemical sequence from (i) to (vii) is sound and leads directly to the desired product. Compared to the other options, which contain chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer, this is the only viable route.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Option B outlines a plausible, multi-step synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Despite the presence of superfluous steps at the end and a key step that gives a mixture of products, it is the only chemically logical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct sequence of reactions:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target is `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`.\n    Let's draw the structure and identify the relationship between the substituents based on standard IUPAC numbering, where the ethoxy group gets position 1.\n    *   Position 1: `-OEt` (ethoxy)\n    *   Position 2: `-C(CH3)3` (tert-butyl, t-Bu)\n    *   Position 3: `-NO2` (nitro)\n\n    The relative positions are:\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are `ortho` (1,2).\n    *   tert-Butyl and nitro are `ortho` (2,3).\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are `meta` (1,3).\n    All three groups are adjacent on the benzene ring (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n\n2.  **Evaluate General Synthetic Strategies:**\n    Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring is often challenging due to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para director. It's very bulky, so it strongly favors para substitution and hinders ortho substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\n    Directly substituting groups onto a benzene ring to achieve a 1,2,3 pattern is difficult. For instance, if we have 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, the next substitution (nitration) would be directed to the positions para and ortho to the strong ethoxy director (positions 4 and 6), not the desired position 3. This indicates a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving blocking groups or manipulating the directing effects of functional groups. The sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) is a classic example of a blocking group that is also a meta-director and can be removed later in the synthesis.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    Let's analyze the proposed reaction sequences. We are looking for a sequence that logically builds the 1,2,3-pattern. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) in option A strongly suggests the use of a sulfonic acid group as a directing/blocking group.\n\n    Let's trace **Option A** step-by-step, assuming the order presented might have issues, but the collection of reagents is key. The most logical synthetic plan is often found by assembling the steps in an order that makes chemical sense.\n\n    **Proposed Logical Synthesis using Reagents from Option A:**\n    The goal is to synthesize `m-tert-butylaniline`, which is a key precursor for 1,2,3-substituted patterns but is hard to make directly. A known route involves using a sulfonic acid blocking group.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (A.i):** `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene`.\n        This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **Step 2 (A.ii):** `tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n        Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky `t-Bu` group directs para, and this step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n\n    *   **Step 3 (A.iii):** `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n        This is a key, non-intuitive step. While simple rules might suggest nitration at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to SO3H), experimental evidence shows that for `p-alkylbenzenesulfonic acids`, nitration often occurs ortho to the sulfonic acid group, especially when the alkyl group is bulky like tert-butyl. So, the nitro group goes to position 2. In this intermediate, the `t-Bu` group and `NO2` group are **meta** to each other.\n\n    *   **Step 4 (A.iv):** `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n        The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n\n    *   **Step 5 (A.viii):** `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → 3-tert-butylaniline`.\n        This is a desulfonation step. Removing the `-SO3H` group from our intermediate (which has amino at C2 and t-Bu at C4 relative to SO3H at C1) leaves the amino and t-butyl groups meta to each other. Renumbering gives `3-tert-butylaniline` (`m-tert-butylaniline`). This is a very powerful way to synthesize this specific meta isomer.\n\n    *   **Step 6 (A.vi):** `3-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`.\n        Now we nitrate our key `m-tert-butylaniline` intermediate. (Protection of the amine as an acetamide is typically done first to control the reaction, but is often omitted in problem statements). The amino group (at C1) and tert-butyl group (at C3) are both ortho/para directors. They both activate position 2. However, nitration preferentially occurs at the position ortho to the amine and meta to the tert-butyl group, which is position 6, leading to `2-amino-4-tert-butylaniline` (`4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`). This creates the correct ortho relationship between the amino group (precursor to ethoxy) and the new nitro group. To obtain the target `2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` the sequence of steps should be changed.\n\nLet's re-examine the nitration of `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (Step 3). As reasoned before, both t-Bu and -SO3H direct substitution to position 3. So the product is `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, t-Bu and NO2 are ORTHO.\n\nLet's rebuild the sequence with this correct intermediate.\n1.  **Steps i, ii, iii:** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene` → `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` → `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *Intermediate:* `t-Bu` and `NO2` are ortho. `SO3H` is at position 1. This is `4-tBu, 3-NO2, 1-SO3H`.\n\n2.  **Step iv (Fe/HCl):** Reduction of the nitro group.\n    *Product:* `3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. `NH2` and `t-Bu` are ortho.\n\n3.  **Step v (NaNO2/HCl):** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    *Product:* `4-tert-butyl-3-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n4.  **Steps vii & ix:** The `N2+` group needs to become an `OEt` group, and the `SO3H` group needs to be replaced by `H`. But we need to introduce a `NO2` group. The `NH2` group we started with is not the source of the final `NO2`.\n    This implies the `NH2` group is temporary. It's used as a director and then removed. The common way to remove `NH2` via diazotization is reduction (e.g., with `H3PO2`), which is not listed.\n\nLet's look at the problem again. There must be a simpler interpretation. The jumbled order of steps in Option A is highly suspicious. If we rearrange them, we can form a logical path.\nPath: i → ii → iii → iv → viii → (New Nitration) → (Diazotization) → (Hydrolysis) → (Etherification)\nThis complexity and the reliance on a non-obvious regioselectivity strongly suggest this is a trick question, and option A contains the correct reagents, even if the sequence is written illogically.\nThe other options (B, C, D) are less plausible.\n*   Option B and C start in ways that lead to 1,2,4-products (para-isomers).\n*   Option D has a completely nonsensical order of reactions (e.g., diazotization without an amine present).\n\nTherefore, Option A, despite its confusing sequence, must contain the correct set of transformations. The key is the use of sulfonation to control substitution, which is unique to this option. The synthesis relies on blocking the para position, forcing substitution elsewhere, manipulating functional groups (reduction, diazotization, etc.), and finally unblocking (desulfonation). Although the specific sequence in the option is scrambled and contains a suspect step (vi), it points to the correct overall strategy required for this difficult synthesis. Let's assume the scrambled sequence that leads to the correct product is what's intended.\n\nFinal Check on the logical path:\n1.  **t-butylation** -> t-butylbenzene (i)\n2.  **Nitration** -> o-nitro-t-butylbenzene (separation required, low yield) + p-nitro-t-butylbenzene. Let's start with ortho.\n3.  **Sulfonation** -> `1-tBu-2-NO2-4-SO3H`\n4.  **Reduction** -> `1-tBu-2-NH2-4-SO3H`\n5.  This path doesn't work.\n\nGiven the choices, Option A describes the correct strategy, even if flawed in presentation. The strategy is:\n1. Alkylate (t-Bu).\n2. Block para position (Sulfonate).\n3. Introduce other groups using the directing effects of t-Bu and SO3H.\n4. Transform/remove the groups as needed.\nThis is the only plausible approach among the options for a 1,2,3 pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's examine the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (sterically bulky, favors *para*).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with this mix of directing groups, is challenging to achieve directly and often requires a careful sequence of reactions, potentially involving blocking groups or rearrangement of functional groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Reaction Sequences**\n\nA good synthetic plan introduces groups in an order that leverages their directing effects. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) work best on activated or neutral rings, not deactivated ones (like nitrobenzene). Therefore, adding the nitro group first (Option A) is generally a poor strategy for subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The reaction of aniline with AlCl3 deactivates the ring and directs *meta*, which could be useful, but is often low-yield. Thus, Options B, C, and D, which start with the formation of tert-butylbenzene, are more plausible starting points.\n\nHowever, options B, C, and D appear to have typos and illogical ordering of steps as written in the prompt. For instance, sulfonating a molecule after it has already been synthesized (Option B) makes no sense. The presence of reagents like SO3/H2SO4 and dilute H2SO4 suggests the use of a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for directing substitution to a less-favored position.\n\nLet's attempt to construct a logical synthetic pathway and see if it corresponds to one of the options, assuming some typos in the options.\n\n**3. Constructing a Logical Pathway**\n\nThe *meta* relationship between the -OEt and -NO2 groups is a strong clue. It suggests that the nitro group was introduced while a *meta*-director was at position 1. The final group, -OEt, is an *ortho, para*-director, which means a functional group transformation must have occurred.\n\nLet's re-examine Option A, which is the only one that isn't structurally nonsensical due to typos. Perhaps there is an interpretation that works. Let's assume a slightly different (and more plausible) order of events than strict linear progression, which is necessary because the listed order is flawed. A plausible reordering of the steps in Option A to achieve the necessary substitution pattern can be found.\n\n**A Step-by-Step Rationale for a Plausible, Though Modified, Sequence (based on the reagents provided):**\n\nLet's assume there's a different way to interpret the F-C alkylation step and subsequent steps, and re-order them into a synthetically viable route. The key to making the 1,2,3-pattern is to use a blocking group. The sulfonation/desulfonation reagents in option A `(vi, vii)` provide for this.\n\nA logical, albeit complex, pathway that can be constructed from the available reagents is as follows:\n\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n3.  **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Aniline → `m-tert-butylaniline`. The AlCl3 catalyst coordinates with the amine, forming an -NH3+ like group which is deactivating and a *meta*-director. While this reaction can have low yields, it produces the required *meta*-disubstituted starting point for the next key steps.\n    *Intermediate:* `m-tert-butylaniline` (`NH2` at C1, `tBu` at C3).\n\n4.  **Insert Blocking Group Step - vi) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonate `m-tert-butylaniline`. The `NH2` and `tBu` groups are both *o,p*-directors. They cooperatively direct sulfonation to the position *para* to the `NH2` group, which is position 4.\n    *Intermediate:* `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (`NH2`@1, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n5.  **Nitration Step - iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitrate the sulfonated intermediate. Let's analyze the directing effects on `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline`. For simplicity, assume the amine is protected as an acetanilide (-NHAc) to avoid oxidation and control reactivity.\n    *   -NHAc (at C1) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    *   -tBu (at C3) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 5.\n    *   -SO3H (at C4) is a *m*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    All three groups strongly direct an incoming electrophile (NO2+) to position 2.\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (after deprotection of the amine). We now have our three desired group types (`NH2`, `NO2`, `tBu`) in a 1,2,3 relationship relative to each other (`NH2`@1, `NO2`@2, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n6.  **Remove Blocking Group - vii) dilute H2SO4:** Heat with dilute acid to remove the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)aniline`. We have the core structure with a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n7.  **Convert Amine to Ethoxy - v) NaNO2/HCl followed by viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Convert the amine to a phenol.\n    *   The `NH2` group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   Heating the diazonium salt in water hydrolyzes it to a phenol (-OH).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)phenol`.\n\n8.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis - ix) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenoxide is formed with NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *Final Product:* `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)benzene`.\n\nNow, we must check the IUPAC name. The highest priority group is the ether, making the base name `ethoxybenzene`. We number C1 at the ether. The substituents are `nitro` at C2 and `tert-butyl` at C3. Following alphabetical order, the name is: `3-(tert-butyl)-2-nitroethoxybenzene`.\n\nThis does not perfectly match the target name of `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. There appears to be a flaw in the question's target name or the provided options. However, the sequence derived by rearranging the steps of option A is the only one that produces a 1,2,3-substituted isomer with all the correct groups. The other options are syntactically jumbled beyond repair. Given the choices, option A contains all the necessary reagents for a plausible (if highly complex and esoteric) route that correctly uses a blocking group strategy, which is almost certainly required for this transformation.\n\nFinal decision leans towards Option A as the intended answer, despite the apparent inconsistencies, because it's the only option that is not nonsensical as written and from which a logical (albeit rearranged) synthesis of a closely related isomer can be devised.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis question asks for a sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first establish the structure of the target molecule based on IUPAC nomenclature.\nThe parent name is benzene. The substituents are:\n-   At C1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n-   At C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n-   At C3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe substituents are arranged on three adjacent carbons (a vicinal or 1,2,3-substitution pattern). The relationships are:\n-   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n-   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n-   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes via classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can be challenging due to the directing effects of substituents, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires that each step be regioselective and efficient.\n\nLet's analyze the given options one by one.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, and the minor product is 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). Let's assume we proceed with the minor ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct substitution to position 4. So, the product would be 4-sulfo-1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate from step (iii) does not contain an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible as written.\n**Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs para, so the product is 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This is a common strategy to block the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct the incoming electrophile to the position ortho to the -tBu group (position 2). Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step suggests nitrating the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and used immediately. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard, safe, or productive reaction.\n**Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: -> Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing -NH2-AlCl3 group. Thus, the major product is m-tert-butylaniline. This is not a \"high-yield\" reaction for other isomers and the reaction is often complex.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. This reaction will produce a mixture of isomers because the directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-directing) and -tBu (ortho,para-directing) groups are not fully cooperative. It is very unlikely to produce a single isomer in high yield, let alone the specific one needed for the final 1,2,3 product.\n**Conclusion: Option C does not represent a high-yield synthesis.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions in option D.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As stated before, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, formed in high yield due to steric preference for the para position. This is a good start for a high-yield synthesis.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to give **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard high-yield reaction.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amine and control regioselectivity, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., via acetylation to form -NHCOCH3), though this step is often omitted in shorthand problems. The protected -NHAc group is a strong o,p-director, as is the -tBu group. Both direct to the position ortho to the acetylamino group (position 2). So, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** is formed (after deprotection). This is a regioselective, high-yield step.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form the diazonium salt, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether. This gives **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nThis sequence of reactions is chemically sound and each step is known to be high-yield. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, NOT the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\nOptions A and B contain chemically invalid steps. Option C involves reactions that are not high-yield and do not selectively lead to the desired precursor. Option D describes a logical and high-yield synthesis of a closely related isomer (1,2,4- pattern). Steps (viii) and (ix) in option D seem superfluous, but the core synthesis path (i-vii) is robust.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question and options A, B, and C are critically flawed for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, it is overwhelmingly likely that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question. If the target compound was intended to be the 1,2,4-isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), then sequence D would be the correct answer. This is the most common scenario for such problems in an educational context.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's number the benzene ring substituents:\n- Position 1: `-OCH2CH3` (ethoxy, OEt)\n- Position 2: `-C(CH3)3` (tert-butyl, tBu)\n- Position 3: `-NO2` (nitro)\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3- arrangement. This substitution pattern is often difficult to achieve through standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups usually favor ortho/para or meta substitution, not sequential substitution at adjacent positions. This complexity suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group conversions is necessary.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis and Strategy Formulation**\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n- **Final step:** The ethoxy group (`-OEt`) is likely formed from a phenol (`-OH`) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This means the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n- **Precursor Analysis (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol):** This molecule has `-OH` (at C1), `-tBu` (at C2), and `-NO2` (at C3). This 1,2,3-pattern still needs to be explained. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylphenol would not work, as both the `-OH` and `-tBu` groups are ortho,para-directors and would direct an incoming nitro group to positions 4 or 6, not 3.\n- **Blocking Group Strategy:** A common method to overcome unfavorable directing effects is to use a \"blocking group,\" typically a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`), which can be added to block a reactive site and then removed later by desulfonation (using dilute acid and heat/steam).\n\n**3. Proposing a Viable Synthetic Pathway**\n\nLet's build a plausible sequence using the blocking group strategy. The goal is to carefully place the substituents in the correct relative positions.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** Block the para position, which is sterically favored and electronically activated by the t-butyl group.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: First Nitration.** Now nitrate the ring. The available ortho positions to the `-tBu` group are now the most activated positions. Both the `-tBu` (o,p-director) and the `-SO3H` (m-director) direct the incoming electrophile to position 2.\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Note: the `tBu` and `NO2` groups are *meta* to each other in this intermediate).\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction.** The nitro group is not the final nitro group; it's a precursor to the hydroxyl group. Reduce it to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5 & 6: Diazotization and Hydrolysis.** Convert the amino group to a hydroxyl group via a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   Diazonium salt + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 7: Second Nitration.** Now, introduce the final nitro group. Let's analyze the directing effects on `4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid` (`-OH` at C2, `-tBu` at C4, `-SO3H` at C1).\n    *   `-OH` (strong o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-SO3H` (m-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-tBu` (o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   All three groups cooperate to direct the new nitro group to position 3 or 5. Let's assume nitration occurs at position 3, which is ortho to the powerful hydroxyl activator.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate now has the correct 1,2,3 relative arrangement of `OH`, `tBu`, and `NO2` (meta `OH/tBu`, ortho `OH/NO2`, ortho `tBu/NO2`).\n\n*   **Step 8: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).**\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `dilute H2SO4`/Heat -> **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. (After desulfonation, IUPAC rules renumber the ring, placing -OH at C1. The pattern remains: OH/tBu are ortho, OH/NO2 are ortho). *Correction*: A closer analysis reveals this step would yield **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** after renumbering.\n\n*   **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the target ethoxy ether.\n    *   2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Comparing the Pathway with the Given Options**\n\nThe sequence of reactions required is:\n1.  Alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n2.  Sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`)\n3.  Nitration (1) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n4.  Reduction (`Fe/HCl`)\n5.  Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`)\n6.  Hydrolysis of diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n7.  Nitration (2) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n8.  Desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`)\n9.  Etherification (`NaOH/EtBr`)\n\nNow we must examine the list of reagents in each option. The specific order listed in all options appears to be scrambled and contains chemically impossible sequences (e.g., diazotization before reduction, or harsh reactions on unstable intermediates). Therefore, the question is likely asking which option provides the necessary *set of reagents* to perform the synthesis.\n\nLet's check the reagent pool for Option A:\n- i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Alkylation)\n- ii), ix) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Two nitrations)\n- iii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation)\n- viii) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction)\n- iv) `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization)\n- v) `dilute H2SO4` & vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Desulfonation & Hydrolysis)\n- vii) `NaOH/EtBr` (Etherification)\n\nThis set of reagents perfectly matches the required transformations for the complex but chemically sound pathway derived above. The other options have similar, but not identical, lists or are similarly scrambled. Given the severe errors in the sequential ordering in all options, the most logical interpretation is that the question asks for the correct collection of reagents. Option A provides all the necessary reagents for a high-yield synthesis, assuming the steps are performed in the correct, logical order, not the scrambled order presented in the option text.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a multistep synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** The parent name is benzene. It has three substituents:\n    1.  `ethoxy` (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  `tert-butyl` (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  `nitro` (-NO2)\n*   **Numbering and IUPAC Name:** According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The substituents are then listed alphabetically. The name `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` corresponds to a structure where the ethoxy group is at C1, the tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3. This is a vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n    *   **Amine (-NH2):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (Correct)\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Aniline: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. **This reaction fails.** The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivated complex, [-NH2-AlCl3]+, which prevents the electrophilic substitution from occurring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to a failed reaction step.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product). (Correct)\n*   iii) SO3/H2SO4: 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Correct, sulfonation occurs ortho to the t-Bu and meta to the NO2).\n*   iv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The substrate at this point, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not have an amine group. **This reaction is incorrect as written.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an inapplicable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   This option follows a blocking group strategy:\n    *   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) SO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para-blocking).\n    *   iii) HNO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (ortho-nitration).\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl: -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (nitro reduction).\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl: -> 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (diazotization).\n*   The steps up to this point are chemically sound. However, the subsequent step is:\n    *   vi) HNO3/H2SO4: Applying strong nitrating conditions to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical transformation. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would likely decompose under these conditions, and HNO3 is not a reagent for any of the standard Sandmeyer-type replacements.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B contains a nonsensical reaction step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet's analyze the sequence presented in option C. (Note: The provided options have up to 9 steps, some of which seem redundant. Let's analyze the core transformation).\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group favoring para substitution.\n*   iii) Fe/HCl: Reduction of the nitro group -> **4-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n*   iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. For this to be a high-yield reaction, the amine must first be protected (e.g., via acetylation to form an acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and moderate its reactivity. The -NHAc group directs ortho. The only available ortho positions are C2 and C6, so nitration yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylacetanilide**. (Correct, assuming protection/deprotection).\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amino group (after deprotection) -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride**. (Correct)\n*   vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Correct)\n*   vii) NaOH/EtBr: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n\nLet's examine the product of this synthesis: `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`.\nNow let's compare it to the target molecule: `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, which is `1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\nThe synthesized product (`OEt@1, NO2@2, tBu@4`) is an **isomer** of the target product (`OEt@1, tBu@2, NO2@3`).\n\n**Reconciliation:**\nWe have analyzed all four options:\n*   A, B, and D contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect (forbidden reaction, inapplicable reagent, nonsensical step).\n*   C outlines a logical and plausible multi-step synthesis. However, it leads to a structural isomer of the desired product.\n\nIn multiple-choice chemistry questions of this nature, it is common for there to be an error in the question itself, specifically in the name of the target compound. Given that sequence C is a coherent and valid synthesis pathway, while the others are not, it is the most probable intended answer. The discrepancy suggests the question should have asked for the synthesis of **4-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene** or **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, despite the final product mismatch, Option C represents the only viable chemical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the positions of the substituents:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents are all adjacent to each other on the benzene ring (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern). This is a complex pattern to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups must be carefully controlled.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is almost always formed by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base (Williamson Ether Synthesis). So, the penultimate molecule is likely **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> Target`. This corresponds to the last step in all the options.\n\n*   **Penultimate Step:** How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is formed from an amino group (-NH2). So, a plausible precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl)--> diazonium salt --(2. H3O+/H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`. These steps are present in the options.\n\n*   **Core Problem:** The main challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** from benzene. This molecule has an amino group at C1, a tBu group at C2, and a nitro group at C3. Achieving this specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern is the crux of the problem. A direct electrophilic substitution approach is unlikely to work due to competing directing effects and steric hindrance. For example, trying to nitrate `o-tert-butylaniline` would lead to nitration at positions 4 and 6, not position 3.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences. All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, which is a logical first step.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is flawed. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on nitrobenzene (a strongly deactivated ring) which would be the product of step (i). Thus, **A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; ...\n    1.  Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene`. A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product.\n    3.  Reduction -> `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    4.  Nitration -> `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`. (Both tBu and the protonated amine -NH3+ direct to this position).\n    5.  This leads to a final product with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is **not** the desired 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **B is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    Step (iv) uses NaNO2/HCl on `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. This reagent is used for diazotization of an amino group, but there is no amino group present at this stage. Thus, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    This sequence employs a blocking group strategy, which is a powerful technique to achieve otherwise difficult substitution patterns.\n    1.  **i) tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-butylbenzene` is sulfonated. The bulky tBu group directs *para*. The *para* position is also thermodynamically favored. Product: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the para position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tBu group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n    At this point, we have an intermediate with substituents that can be further manipulated. While the subsequent ordering of reagents (v-ix) in option C appears confusing or contains a typo (e.g., step vi seems misplaced), the initial strategy (steps i-iv) is the most chemically sound and logical approach among all choices for building a complex, sterically-controlled trisubstituted benzene. It is the only option that uses a blocking group to force a substitution pattern that is not achievable by direct substitution. Therefore, it is the most plausible route to the target molecule, assuming some ambiguity or error in the later steps as presented. No other option presents a viable pathway.\n\nBased on this analysis, the strategy outlined in Option C is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield by using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure based on the IUPAC name:\n- The parent structure is ethoxybenzene.\n- The ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a **1,2,3-pattern**:\n- OEt (at C1) and tBu (at C2) are *ortho* to each other.\n- tBu (at C2) and NO2 (at C3) are *ortho* to each other.\n- OEt (at C1) and NO2 (at C3) are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n- **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activating group, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activating group, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivating group, *meta* director.\n\nThe synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, especially with bulky groups, is notoriously difficult using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents often lead to 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. This suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving functional group manipulation and/or blocking groups is necessary.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Steps**\n\nThe target molecule contains an ethoxy group (-OEt). This is typically formed from a hydroxyl group (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` or `NaOEt`). A hydroxyl group on a benzene ring (a phenol) is often created from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+, heat`).\n\nTherefore, a plausible end to the synthesis would be:\n`...-NH2  --[NaNO2/HCl]-->  ...-N2+  --[H3O+, heat]-->  ...-OH  --[NaOH/EtBr]-->  ...-OEt`\n\nLet's look for this pattern in the options.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Option**\n\nAll options start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. This is a reasonable first step.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence proposes nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, and then performing a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires an amino group (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonated nitrotoluene derivative, which has no amino group. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible. Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence correctly forms an amine (iv) and diazotizes it (v). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately in the next step. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or viable reaction under these conditions. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical logic, despite the regiochemical challenges pointed out earlier.\n    - **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    - **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The bulky tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but it strongly favors *para* substitution due to sterics. The major product is `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would proceed through this major isomer.\n    - **iii) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming `p-tert-butylaniline`.\n    - **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** We are nitrating `p-tert-butylaniline`. The powerful activating -NH2 group directs *ortho*. So, the nitro group adds at the position ortho to the amine and meta to the tert-butyl group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`.\n    - **v) NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** Converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    - **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** Replaces the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol`.\n    - **vii) NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** Converts the phenol to an ether, forming `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`.\n\n    **Conclusion of steps i-vii:** This sequence is a chemically logical and high-yield synthesis for **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is a **1,2,4-isomer**. This does not match the **1,2,3-isomer** in the question's title.\n\n    - **viii) SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation) and ix) dilute H2SO4 (Desulfonation):** These last two steps involve adding a sulfonic acid group and then immediately removing it. This has no net effect on the molecule and seems nonsensical in this context.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThere appears to be a significant error in the question. None of the proposed pathways lead to the named product (a 1,2,3-isomer) in high yield. Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option A describes a logical synthesis for a related compound (a 1,2,4-isomer), albeit with two superfluous steps at the end. Given that a choice must be made from the given options, Option A is the \"least incorrect\" as it represents the only plausible sequence of reaction *types*, despite leading to the wrong regioisomer and having redundant final steps. It is the only option that is not fundamentally impossible from a reaction-order perspective.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically hindered and requires a careful synthetic strategy to control the regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the groups is crucial for planning the synthesis using electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution over *ortho*.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** (Intermediate) Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** (Intermediate) Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** (Intermediate/Blocking Group) Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Endgames**\n\nLet's consider how the final group might be added.\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The ethoxy group is almost certainly added at the end by reacting the corresponding phenol (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol) with an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This is a robust and common reaction. This means we should aim to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Nitration as the final step:** Nitrating 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene. Both -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para* directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. So, nitration cannot be the final step.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation as a late step:** Tert-butylating 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The activating -OEt group would direct the incoming -tBu group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 gives the correct product. This is plausible, but Friedel-Crafts reactions on moderately deactivated rings can be sluggish.\n\nThe most likely penultimate molecule is the phenol. Our goal is to find a high-yield synthesis for **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the given reaction sequences. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that regioselectivity is well-controlled at each step. This often involves using blocking groups.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Option B starts by making 4-tert-butylaniline, which has a 1,4-substitution pattern, incorrect for our 1,2,3-target. Option C has a typographical error in the sequence (\"HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii)\"), making it difficult to follow. Both are unlikely.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard FC-alkylation).\n    *   ii) `tert-Butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)-->` **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is an excellent strategic move. The bulky t-Bu group directs sulfonation to the *para* position, which is now \"blocked\".\n    *   iii) `4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Both the -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups direct nitration to the positions *ortho* to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). This is a classic use of a blocking group to achieve high-yield ortho substitution, which is otherwise difficult. This gives us the crucial `tBu-ortho-NO2` relationship.\n    *   So far, this is a superb, high-yield strategy. Let's look at the remaining steps.\n    *   iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduces the -NO2 group to -NH2. -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt, -N2+.\n    *   vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step is chemically incorrect as written. One does not perform nitration on a highly deactivated diazonium salt with `HNO3/H2SO4`. Also, replacing the diazonium group with -NO2 requires different reagents (a Sandmeyer-type reaction, e.g., NaNO2/Cu). The sequence of steps from (iv) onwards is nonsensical and would not lead to the target product. Therefore, option D is incorrect due to a flawed sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) `tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** + **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. The desired ortho isomer is the *minor* product; the para isomer is major due to sterics. This is a significant blow to the \"high-yield\" claim. However, let's assume we can isolate the ortho isomer and proceed.\n    *   iii) `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)-->` **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard nitro reduction).\n    *   iv) `2-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` ? Nitration of an aniline in strong acid first protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). For 2-tert-butylanilinium, the -NH3+ at C1 is a *meta*-director (directs to C3, C5), and the -tBu at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director (directs to C4, C6). Substitution at C3 gives the needed **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. While a mixture of isomers is expected, formation of the 3-nitro product is chemically plausible.\n    *   v) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)-->` Diazotization to the corresponding diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   vi) `Diazonium salt --(H3O+, H2O/Heat)-->` **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This is also a standard reaction. We have now synthesized our key precursor.\n    *   vii) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol --(NaOH/EtBr)-->` **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Standard Williamson ether synthesis to yield the final product.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` & ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps are superfluous and make no chemical sense following the successful synthesis in step vii. They appear to be an error in the question's construction.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   Options B and C are incorrect due to leading to the wrong isomers or being chemically incoherent.\n*   Option D starts with an excellent strategy (blocking group) but its subsequent steps are chemically flawed and illogical as written.\n*   Option A describes a chemically plausible sequence (steps i-vii) that successfully produces the target molecule. Its primary weaknesses are a likely low-yield step at the beginning (ii) and two inexplicable, extraneous steps at the end (viii, ix).\n\nDespite its flaws, Option A is the only choice that presents a complete, step-by-step pathway from starting material to final product that is chemically possible, even if not optimal in terms of yield. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (wrong isomers or nonsensical reactions). Therefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming errors in the question's construction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and work backward to deduce a plausible synthetic route, then compare it with the given options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\n*   **Benzene ring** as the scaffold.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3, or -OEt) at C1.\n    *   tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3, or -tBu) at C2.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The three substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, ortho,para-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA key challenge in this synthesis is creating the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Direct electrophilic substitution on a monosubstituted benzene typically gives ortho/para or meta products, not a mixture that leads easily to a 1,2,3 pattern. Often, this requires manipulating the directing effects of substituents, for example by converting an amino group to a diazonium salt, or using a temporary blocking group.\n\nLet's consider the most likely final step. Introducing the ethoxy group last via a Williamson ether synthesis is a common and effective strategy. This would involve reacting the corresponding phenol with an ethyl halide.\n\n*   **Proposed Final Step:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`\n    This reaction is sound. NaOH deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide.\n\n*   **Penultimate Intermediate:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n    How do we make this phenol? A common way to make a phenol is from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2, HCl)--> diazonium salt --(H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n    This sequence is also a standard, reliable method.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline`\n    The main synthetic challenge is now reduced to preparing this substituted aniline. Let's think about how to introduce these groups (amino, tert-butyl, nitro) with the correct 1,2,3-relationship.\n    A logical approach would be to start with 2-(tert-butyl)aniline and then nitrate it.\n\n    1.  **Preparation of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline:**\n        *   Start with benzene. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride gives tert-butylbenzene. `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n        *   Nitrate tert-butylbenzene. The t-Bu group is o,p-directing, but because it is very bulky, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. The ortho product (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) is the minor product. To proceed, we must separate this ortho isomer. `tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene` (ortho) + `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene` (para).\n        *   Reduce the nitro group of the ortho isomer to an amine using a reagent like Fe/HCl. `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-(tert-butyl)aniline`.\n\n    2.  **Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline to get 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline:**\n        *   Direct nitration of anilines with HNO3/H2SO4 is complex. The strong acid protonates the amino group to form an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director.\n        *   So, we are nitrating the `2-(tert-butyl)anilinium ion`. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   The `-NH3+` group at C1 is a meta-director, directing incoming electrophiles (NO2+) to C3 and C5.\n            *   The `-tBu` group at C2 is an ortho,para-director *relative to its own position*. Ortho positions are C1 and C3. The para position is C5.\n            *   Both groups cooperate to direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5.\n            *   This would produce a mixture of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` and `2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline`. While a mixture is expected, this route provides a plausible pathway to the required `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` intermediate.\n\n**Summary of Plausible Synthesis:**\n1.  Benzene + `t-BuCl/AlCl3` -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor ortho-product)\n3.  1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + `Fe/HCl` -> 2-(tert-butyl)aniline\n4.  2-(tert-butyl)aniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline\n5.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazonium salt\n6.  Diazonium salt + `H3O+/Heat` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n7.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\nNow, let's compare this deduced sequence with the given options.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...` Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which fails because the Lewis acid AlCl3 reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, A is incorrect.\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence leads to an intermediate where the t-butyl group and the eventual nitro group are in a meta relationship, which is inconsistent with the ortho relationship in the final product. So, B is incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence lists reagents in a chemically nonsensical order (e.g., trying to diazotize a molecule with no amino group at step iv). So, C is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    The first seven steps of this option (`i` to `vii`) exactly match the plausible synthesis we deduced above. Steps `viii` and `ix` are superfluous reagents added at the end, likely as distractors, as the target molecule has already been formed in step `vii`.\n\nDespite the potential for low yields at steps (ii) and (iv), this sequence is the only chemically logical and viable pathway among the choices to afford the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a breakdown of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The goal is to identify the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1 (strongly activating, ortho,para-directing).\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)** at C2 (weakly activating, ortho,para-directing).\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at C3 (strongly deactivating, meta-directing).\n\nThe substituents are arranged vicinally (1,2,3 pattern). This complex substitution pattern often requires a multi-step synthesis with careful control of regiochemistry, possibly using blocking groups that are later removed.\n\n### Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)\n\n1.  **Final Step: Etherification.** The ethoxy group is best introduced at the end by a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This reaction is reliable and high-yielding.\n    *   Target: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n    *   Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**\n    *   Reagents: NaOH, then EtBr (or a similar ethyl halide/sulfate).\n\n2.  **Making the Phenol Precursor.** The core of the problem is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The substituents (OH, tBu, NO2) are in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult:\n    *   Nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would not yield the 3-nitro product in high yield, as the powerful -OH group directs nitration to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   Alkylating 3-nitrophenol would likely result in a mixture of isomers, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired 2-tert-butyl isomer.\n\n    A more controlled approach is needed, likely involving blocking groups and substituent manipulation. A plausible, albeit long, synthetic route can be constructed using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a removable directing group.\n\n### Proposed Synthetic Route and Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's devise a valid synthetic pathway and see which option provides the necessary reagents.\n\n**A logical (though complex) synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Nitration:** This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. The para isomer, 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, is major, but the ortho isomer, **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, is needed for this specific path. Let's assume we can obtain and use the ortho isomer.\n3.  **Sulfonation:** The t-butyl (o,p) and nitro (m) groups both direct the incoming -SO3H group to the position para to the t-butyl group.\n    *   2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Intermediate + Fe/HCl → **4-amino-3-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt.\n    *   Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by heating with water/acid.\n    *   Diazonium salt + H3O+/heat → **3-(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid** (also known as 2-tert-butyl-5-sulfophenol).\n7.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this phenol derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the final pattern.\n    *   -OH (at C1 of the phenol) and -tBu (at C2) both direct to C3 and C5. The -SO3H (at C5) also has directing effects. Careful analysis shows that nitration is plausible at C3, which is sterically hindered but ortho to the strongly activating -OH group.\n    *   Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4 → **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitro-5-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid** (Error in naming in reasoning - correct product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butyl-5-sulfophenol**).\n8.  **Desulfonation:** Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Intermediate + H3O+/heat → **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. We have successfully made the phenol precursor.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Convert the phenol to the target ethoxy ether.\n    *   Phenol precursor + NaOH/EtBr → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Matching the Route to the Options\n\nNow let's check which option provides all the necessary reagents for this 9-step synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nThis option contains all the reagents required for the sequence described above, although they are listed in a scrambled order.\n    *   (i) for step 1\n    *   (ii) and (ix) for the two nitration steps (2 and 7)\n    *   (iii) for sulfonation (step 3)\n    *   (viii) for reduction (step 4)\n    *   (iv) for diazotization (step 5)\n    *   (v) and (vi) for hydrolysis and desulfonation (steps 6 and 8)\n    *   (vii) for the final etherification (step 9)\n\n*   **Option B:** Starts with nitration, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, which is problematic and doesn't lead to the correct substitution pattern. Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence, when analyzed correctly, leads to intermediates that do not result in the desired final product. For instance, the nitration of p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (steps ii and iii) gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which has a meta relationship between the eventual OH and t-butyl groups, which is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence was analyzed and shown to produce an isomer, 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene, which is not the target molecule. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that contains the full set of reagents needed for a plausible, albeit complex, synthesis of the target compound. The confusing order of reagents in the option is likely intentional.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n*   Relative positions:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It's an *ortho, para* director and an activating group. It's very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the *ortho* position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It's a strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A strong *meta* director and a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group. It's formed by reducing -NO2. It can be protonated in strong acid to form -NH3+, which becomes a *meta* director. It can also be converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is a versatile intermediate.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group. It can be converted to an -OEt group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A *meta* director and a deactivating group. It's often used as a reversible \"blocking group\" because it can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the correct product isomer.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\nii) + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the *para* product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. The *para* position is now blocked.\niii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group.\n*   **Isomer Check:** At this stage, the intermediate has the t-butyl group and the nitro group *meta* to each other. The final product requires them to be *ortho*. Since the relative positions of these two groups are already wrong, this entire sequence cannot lead to the desired product. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\nii) + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**.\niii) + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **This reaction fails**. Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on strongly activated rings like aniline because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene** (+ the major *para* isomer). We must assume we can isolate the minor *ortho* product to proceed.\niii) + SO3/H2SO4 → Sulfonation of 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p) and -NO2 (m) direct to the same positions (C4 and C6). The product would be something like **4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\niv) + NaNO2/HCl → **This reaction fails**. The reagent NaNO2/HCl is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The molecule at step iii has no amino group. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**. As with option C, this step requires the isolation of the minor *ortho* isomer. While not \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step for the required substitution pattern.\niii) + Fe/HCl → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This is a standard reaction.\niv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. This is the crucial step. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n    *   Starting with 2-(tert-butyl)aniline (NH2 at C1, tBu at C2). The anilinium ion has -NH3+ at C1, -tBu at C2.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs an incoming electrophile to positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The -tBu group directs to positions C3 (ortho) and C5 (para).\n    *   Both groups direct substitution to C3 and C5. The reaction yields a mixture of **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline** and **5-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. We need the 3-nitro isomer. Although it may not be the major product, its formation is chemically sound.\nv) + NaNO2/HCl → The amino group of **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline** is converted to a diazonium salt: **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)benzenediazonium salt**.\nvi) + H3O+, H2O/Heat → The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)phenol**.\nvii) + NaOH/EtBr → The phenol is converted to an ether (Williamson ether synthesis), yielding **1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the name and structure of the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion on steps i-vii:** This sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct isomer. The \"high-yield\" claim in the question may be an exaggeration due to the isomeric mixtures formed in steps ii and iv, but the pathway is fundamentally correct.\n*   **Steps viii and ix:** The presence of `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4` at the end of the sequence is illogical, as they would sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product for no reason. These are likely included erroneously in the option. However, among the given choices, Option D is the only one that provides a chemically viable route to the correct product isomer.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions A, B, and C contain fatal chemical flaws (wrong isomer or impossible reactions). Option D describes a sequence that, despite potential yield issues and extraneous final steps, correctly navigates the regiochemical challenges to form the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Therefore, it is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThis question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\nThe molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n- An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe groups are arranged adjacent to each other (1,2,3-substitution pattern). Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n- **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It's bulky and sterically hinders ortho positions.\n- **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern with these groups requires a careful strategy, often involving blocking groups or manipulation of functional groups via diazotization (Sandmeyer reactions).\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This complex is deactivating and a meta-director. Therefore, this step would produce m-tert-butylaniline. This 1,3-substitution pattern is not a suitable precursor for the desired 1,2,3-substituted product. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\niii) SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) is not an amine. Therefore, this step is impossible as written in this sequence. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> This would produce mainly p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (~80%) and some o-tert-butylnitrobenzene (~12%). To be a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we must use the major product. But let's assume, for the sake of argument, we could proceed with the ortho isomer.\niii) Fe/HCl -> Reduction gives o-tert-butylaniline.\niv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The -NH3+ group (at C1) directs to C3 and C5. The -tBu group (at C2) directs to C4 and C6. Due to conflicting directing effects and steric hindrance, this reaction would produce a mixture of products and is unlikely to yield the required 3-nitro isomer in high yield. The subsequent steps are therefore unlikely to lead to the target cleanly. Thus, Option C is not a viable high-yield route.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence uses a **blocking group** strategy, which is a powerful technique for controlling regiochemistry in EAS.\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, this reaction proceeds with high regioselectivity to give the para-product, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The para position is now \"blocked\".\niii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the tert-butyl group (C2 and C6). This step produces **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield.\nThis initial three-step sequence is synthetically sound and efficient for creating an ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivative, which would be difficult to obtain otherwise. The remaining steps, while complex and possibly containing typos or being out of order, describe the necessary transformations to reach the target. Let's trace a logical, rearranged path using the provided reagents:\n\nA possible intended sequence, re-ordering the steps from option A:\n1. Steps (i), (ii), (iii) produce **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n2. Step (viii) **dilute H2SO4** (with heat) would cause **desulfonation**, removing the blocking group to yield **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n3. Step (iv) **Fe/HCl** would reduce the nitro group to give **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n4. Step (v) **NaNO2/HCl** would convert the amine to a **diazonium salt**.\n5. Step (vii) **H3O+, H2O/Heat** would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n6. Step (ix) **NaOH/EtBr** is a Williamson ether synthesis that converts the phenol to an ether, giving **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7. Finally, step (vi) **HNO3/H2SO4** would be the nitration of this ether. For the reaction to be correct, this nitration must selectively occur at the C3 position. The directing effects are: -OEt (strong o,p-director) directs to C4 and C6. -tBu (o,p-director) directs to C3 and C5. While a mixture would typically be expected, the combined steric and electronic effects in this specific crowded system might favor the 3-nitro product to some extent, or this represents the intended, if not perfect, path.\n\nDespite the confusing order and the questionable selectivity of the final step, Option A is the only one that employs a viable and powerful strategy (sulfonic acid blocking group) to create a key ortho-disubstituted intermediate, which is essential for reaching a 1,2,3-substituted product from benzene. The other options contain clear and fatal chemical errors in their initial steps. Therefore, Option A represents the most plausible synthetic design among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   The substituents are: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3 (meaning all three groups are adjacent on the benzene ring).\n    *   Let's establish the relative positions based on IUPAC naming:\n        *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy)\n        *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl)\n        *   C3: -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   Relationships between groups:\n        *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n        *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n        *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    This is crucial for planning the order of electrophilic aromatic substitutions.\n    *   **-OEt (Alkoxy):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director.\n    *   **-tBu (Alkyl):** Activating group, ortho-, para- director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder ortho positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strong deactivating group, meta- director.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director. It is often formed by reducing a -NO2 group. In strong acid (like nitrating mixture), it protonates to -NH3+, which becomes a deactivating, meta- director.\n    *   **-OH (Hydroxy):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director. The -OEt group is usually introduced at the end by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr, Williamson Ether Synthesis). This is a likely final step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Options Systematically:**\n    All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n    *   **Step i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** This is the common first step in all options.\n\n    Now, let's analyze the path for each option. The goal is to find a sequence that correctly places the groups in the 1,2,3 pattern and is described as \"high-yield\".\n\n    *   **Path A, C, D Evaluation:** A quick check of these options reveals chemically nonsensical steps.\n        *   **Option A**: Step (iv) calls for NaNO2/HCl (a diazotization reagent) to be used on a sulfonic acid intermediate (from step iii). Diazotization requires an amino group (-NH2). This is incorrect.\n        *   **Option C**: Step (vi) calls for SO3/H2SO4 to be used on a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or logical reaction in this context.\n        *   **Option D**: Step (vi) calls for HNO3/H2SO4 to be used on a diazonium salt. This is also chemically incorrect.\n        *   Since options A, C, and D contain steps that are not chemically sound, they are highly unlikely to be correct.\n\n    *   **Detailed Evaluation of Option B:** This option appears to be the most chemically plausible sequence, so let's analyze it step-by-step.\n        i.  **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.**\n        ii. **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para product is major due to less steric hindrance. The problem asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which usually implies taking the major product. However, as we saw with other options, it's possible this assumption needs to be challenged. Let's trace the synthesis assuming we proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), as the final product requires the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This is a potential low-yield step, but it's the only way to get the correct relative positioning.\n        iii. **Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have o-tert-butylaniline (1-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzene).\n        iv. **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** We now nitrate o-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects are from -NH2 (at C2) and -tBu (at C1). In strong acid, -NH2 becomes -NH3+, a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director.\n            *   -tBu at C1 directs to C3 (ortho) and C5 (ortho).\n            *   -NH3+ at C2 directs to C4 (meta) and C6 (meta).\n            *   The activating -tBu group is a stronger director than the deactivating -NH3+ group. It will preferentially direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to positions C3 and C5. To get our target product, we need the new -NO2 group at C3. This leads to 1-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzene (IUPAC name: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline). This step gives the desired regiochemistry.\n        v.  **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). We have 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium salt.\n        vi. **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This produces 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n        vii. **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The -OH group is converted to an -OEt group. This yields 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene, which is exactly the target molecule.\n        viii. **SO3/H2SO4** and ix. **dilute H2SO4:** These last two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. They would not result in a net change and seem superfluous to the synthesis, possibly added to make the option list longer or as a distractor. The core synthesis is completed at step vii.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Despite a potential low-yield step (step ii), the sequence of reactions in option B is the only one that is chemically logical and leads to the desired final product. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, Option B represents the correct pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The key spatial relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the substituents is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An alkyl group. It's an activating ortho-, para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para-substitution over ortho-substitution.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** An alkoxy group. It's a strongly activating ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that introduces these three groups in the correct positions with high yield. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should favor the desired isomer as the major product.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option C and Option D:**\n*   **Step i):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation). This correctly forms tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). The -tBu group is a para-director. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene overwhelmingly yields the para isomer, 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The desired ortho-nitro isomer is a very minor product. A synthesis relying on a minor product is not \"high-yield\". From the para-isomer, it is impossible to arrive at the 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Options C and D start with a step that leads to the wrong major isomer, so they are incorrect for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **Step i):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). Forms nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** `Fe/HCl` (Reduction). Forms aniline.\n*   **Step iii):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on aniline). This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and directs subsequent substitutions to the meta position. This is not a viable method for introducing an alkyl group ortho or para to the amino group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B involves a chemically infeasible step for a high-yield synthesis and is incorrect.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis option, by elimination, is the most likely candidate. Let's analyze its strategy.\n*   **Step i):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Forms tert-butylbenzene. This is a standard and effective first step.\n*   **Step ii):** `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation). The -tBu group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) to the para position. This forms 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. This step is crucial; the -SO3H group acts as a \"blocking group,\" occupying the para position that would otherwise be the major site of further substitution.\n*   **Step iii):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). With the para position blocked, the ortho-, para-directing -tBu group is now forced to direct the incoming nitro group (-NO2) to one of the ortho positions (C2 or C6). This is a classic and effective strategy to achieve ortho-substitution on a sterically hindered ring. This step correctly establishes the ortho relationship between the -tBu and -NO2 groups that is seen in the final product.\n*   **Subsequent Steps (iv-ix):** The sequence as written from step (iv) onwards contains several confusing or seemingly incorrect steps (e.g., step vi `HNO3/H2SO4` after diazotization). However, the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the only one among the options that correctly and efficiently creates the necessary ortho-(tert-butyl, nitro) intermediate scaffold. It is common in such problems for the correct option to be the one with the only sound underlying synthetic strategy, even if some details are written incorrectly. The core logic of using a blocking group to control regiochemistry is sound and points to A as the intended answer. The later steps would involve a series of transformations: reduction of the nitro group, diazotization, replacement of the diazonium and sulfonyl groups, and finally introduction of the ethoxy and nitro groups in the final correct positions, likely involving a phenol intermediate for the Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). While the exact sequence listed is flawed, the foundational steps are correct only in option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the reaction strategies, we can conclude:\n*   Options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed for a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n*   Option A employs the correct and necessary strategy of using a blocking group (-SO3H) to force ortho-substitution next to a bulky tert-butyl group. This is the only plausible route among the choices to establish the required regiochemistry.\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis problem requires devising a multi-step synthesis for a specifically substituted benzene ring, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key challenge lies in achieving the 1,2,3- (or vicinal) substitution pattern, as standard electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions on simple precursors tend to yield ortho/para or meta products, not complex vicinal patterns. A successful synthesis for such a target often involves a careful strategy of activating/deactivating groups, blocking groups, and functional group interconversions, typically involving aniline and diazonium salt chemistry.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule:\n- Benzene ring with three substituents: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n- According to the name `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, the numbering is as follows:\n  - C1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n  - C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n  - C3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n- The relative positions are:\n  - OEt and tBu are ortho (1,2).\n  - tBu and NO2 are ortho (2,3).\n  - OEt and NO2 are meta (1,3).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on standard organic synthesis principles.\n\n**General Strategy Consideration:**\nTo obtain a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, direct substitution on a mono- or di-substituted benzene is often difficult. A common and powerful strategy involves:\n1.  Introducing a temporary blocking/directing group, like a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be removed later (desulfonation).\n2.  Using an amino group (-NH2), which can be diazotized (-N2+) and subsequently replaced by a variety of other groups (e.g., -OH, which can be converted to -OEt) or removed entirely (-H).\n\nLet's try to construct a logical synthetic pathway that could lead to the target and see if it matches any of the options. A promising strategy involves using both a sulfonic acid blocking group and an amino group for directing and later replacement.\n\nLet's try to construct a valid pathway from the reagents suggested in the options, assuming the lists might be jumbled. A possible correct sequence that can lead to a 1,2,3 pattern is as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene`\n2.  **Sulfonation**: Introduce a sulfonic acid group. The tert-butyl group is an ortho-para director, and due to its bulkiness, the para product will be formed in high yield. This -SO3H group will serve as a blocking group for the para position.\n    `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n3.  **Nitration**: Now, we nitrate the ring. We have a t-Bu group (activator, o,p-director) and an -SO3H group (deactivator, m-director) para to each other. The t-Bu group at C1 directs incoming electrophiles to positions 2 and 6. The -SO3H group at C4 also directs to positions 2 and 6 (meta to itself). Thus, nitration selectively occurs at position 2 (or 6).\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n4.  **Desulfonation**: The sulfonic acid group has served its purpose in directing the nitration. Now, it can be removed by heating with dilute aqueous acid. This step is crucial for changing the substitution pattern.\n    `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → 3-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene`\n5.  **Reduction**: Now, reduce the nitro group to an amino group. This will be our key directing group for the next step and the precursor to the final hydroxyl/ethoxy group.\n    `3-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 3-tert-butylaniline` (or m-tert-butylaniline)\n6.  **Nitration**: We nitrate again. In 3-tert-butylaniline, we have an amino group (-NH2, strong activator, o,p-director) and a tert-butyl group (weak activator, o,p-director). Both are meta to each other. Under the acidic nitrating conditions, the amine protonates to -NH3+ (deactivator, m-director). However, the reaction can be controlled to have the activating character of the amine/anilide direct the substitution. The -NH2 group (at C1) directs to 2, 4, 6. The -tBu group (at C3) directs to 2, 4, 6. The directing effects reinforce each other at positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is sterically hindered, but it is ortho to the very powerful activating amine group, making this substitution possible. Let's assume substitution occurs at position 6 to create the required skeleton.\n    `3-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 6-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`. Renaming by priority gives us **5-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. Let's check the skeleton: NH2, NO2 ortho; NH2, tBu meta; NO2, tBu para. This is not the target skeleton.\n    What if nitration goes to position 2? We would get **2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline**. The skeleton is: NH2-C, NO2-C, tBu-C. Let's proceed with this intermediate.\n7.  **Diazotization**: Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt.\n    `2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride`\n8.  **Hydrolysis**: Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by heating in water.\n    `...diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol`\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis**: Convert the phenol into an ether.\n    `2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzene`\n\nLet's check this final product's name against the target.\nMy product: OEt at C1, NO2 at C2, tBu at C3. Name: 3-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene. This is NOT the target molecule, which has tBu at C2 and NO2 at C3.\n\nLet's re-examine the nitration of m-tert-butylaniline (step 6). It is the most critical and least certain step. If instead of `2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`, the product was `4-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`, the whole sequence would fail to produce a vicinal product.\n\nThere seems to be no straightforward sequence that leads to the product. This suggests there might be an error in the question or options. However, let's analyze the given options one last time.\n\n*   **Option A**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n    This sequence is very long and contains all the necessary reagents for a complex synthesis involving blocking groups and diazonium chemistry. The order seems confusing, particularly steps vi, vii, and viii. If we reorder them as discussed above (`desulfonate`, `reduce`, etc.), it doesn't quite yield the target. However, this is the most \"equipped\" option to solve a complex positional problem. If we assume the sequence is `i -> ii -> iii -> iv (reduction of NO2) -> viii (desulfonation) -> ...` this leads down the path that fails.\n    Perhaps there's an unusual rearrangement or ipso-substitution. Given the complexity, this sequence remains a remote possibility.\n\n*   **Option B**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3...` Step iii, Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, is problematic and generally avoided. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl...` This path starts with `tBu-Ph -> p-tBu-Ph-NO2 -> p-tBu-aniline`. Any further substitution on this 1,4-disubstituted ring will lead to a 1,2,4-pattern, not the desired 1,2,3. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: The numbering is garbled, and it seems to contain a random assortment of reagents in a non-chemical order (e.g., `iv) NaNO2/HCl` before an amine is formed).\n\nComparing the flawed options, Option A represents the most plausible strategic approach for creating a complex substitution pattern, using a sulfonyl blocking group and a full sequence of functional group interconversions via an amine. Despite the apparent incorrect ordering or a cryptic step, its components are the most relevant for this type of advanced synthesis problem. If one of these options must be correct, Option A is the most likely candidate, assuming a non-obvious transformation or reordering corrects its flaws. Given the analysis that no standard sequence works, and option A has the most sophisticated set of reagents, we select it as the intended answer, despite its apparent inconsistencies.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nThis problem asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a complex synthesis problem involving electrophilic aromatic substitution and functional group interconversions. The key challenge is to control the regiochemistry to achieve the 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: -OEt (Ethoxy group, strong activator, ortho-, para-director)\n    *   C2: -C(CH3)3 (tert-Butyl group, weak activator, ortho-, para-director, sterically bulky)\n    *   C3: -NO2 (Nitro group, strong deactivator, meta-director)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly and frequently requires the use of blocking groups (like -SO3H) that can be removed later, or careful manipulation of the directing effects of substituents.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed synthetic routes. We need to find a sequence that logically leads to the desired arrangement of substituents. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is to install a removable blocking group. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this, as it can be added via sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) and removed via desulfonation (dilute H2SO4/heat).\n\nWe will analyze Option A, as it presents the most sophisticated and potentially correct strategy involving blocking groups. The options as written seem to contain typos; we will attempt to interpret them in a chemically logical manner.\n\n**Analysis of Option A (with logical corrections for apparent typos):**\n\nThe steps in Option A are:\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\nThis sequence appears jumbled. A plausible pathway to a 1,2,3-substituted benzene using these reagents would proceed as follows. Let's rearrange them logically.\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**\n    *   Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> **tert-Butylbenzene**\n    *   This is a standard start to introduce the bulky alkyl group.\n\n*   **Step ii: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director. Due to its large size, sulfonation occurs almost exclusively at the sterically accessible para position. This blocks the para position from further substitution.\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The -tBu group directs ortho/para, and the -SO3H group directs meta. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6).\n\n*   **Step iv: Reduction of Nitro Group**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl -> **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n\n*   **Step v: Diazotization**\n    *   2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl (0-5 °C) -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n\n*   **Step vi (from original option's step vii): Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonic acid + H3O+/H2O/Heat -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), creating a phenol derivative.\n\n*   **Step vii (from original option's step ix): Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid + NaOH/EtBr -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-ethoxybenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The phenol is converted to an ethyl ether.\n\n*   **Step viii (from original option's step viii): Desulfonation (Unblocking Step)**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-ethoxybenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat -> **3-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene**\n    *   The blocking sulfonic acid group is removed, yielding a 1,3-disubstituted benzene derivative.\n\n*   **Step ix (from original option's step vi): Final Nitration**\n    *   3-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (Target molecule)\n    *   Now we nitrate the 1,3-disubstituted ring. We have a strong activator (-OEt) and a weak activator (-tBu).\n    *   -OEt (at C1) directs ortho/para, to positions 2, 4, 6.\n    *   -tBu (at C3) directs ortho/para, to positions 2, 4, 6.\n    *   Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Nitration at position 2 is sterically hindered but electronically favorable. While a mixture might be expected, nitration at position 3 is highly disfavored as it is meta to the powerful directing -OEt group. Of the plausible products, none directly match the target molecule based on standard directing rules.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the final nitration step, which is the most complex. The product needed is `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. Let's re-examine my proposed `Path 3` in the scratchpad.\nRe-arranging the steps differently: After making `4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid` (Step vi), we can nitrate it first.\n*   **Alternate Step vii: Nitration of Phenol derivative**\n    *   On `4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid`, nitration is directed by -OH (strong o,p), -tBu (o,p), and -SO3H (m). All groups direct to positions 3 and 5. Let's assume nitration occurs at C3.\n    *   Product: `4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n*   **Alternate Step viii: Desulfonation**\n    *   Removal of -SO3H from C1 gives `3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol`. Numbering by phenol rules (OH=C1), this is `2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol`.\n\n*   **Alternate Step ix: Etherification**\n    *   Reacting with NaOH/EtBr gives `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzene`.\n\nThis product is `1,2,3-trisubstituted` and has the groups OEt, NO2, and tBu ortho to one another in a chain.\n*   My Result: OEt is ortho to NO2; NO2 is ortho to tBu.\n*   Target Molecule: OEt is ortho to tBu; tBu is ortho to NO2.\nThese are distinct isomers.\n\nHowever, given the provided options, all of which are constructed from standard laboratory reactions, there is a very high probability that the question or options contain typos. Option A presents the only chemically sophisticated pathway that utilizes a blocking group strategy to generate a 1,2,3 substitution pattern. The other options (B, C, D) can be shown to lead to 1,2,4 isomers or are nonsensical in their listed order. The sequence of transformations required for the synthesis is uniquely represented by the reagents in option A. It's the only one that could plausibly lead to *any* 1,2,3 isomer. Therefore, despite the ambiguity, it stands out as the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An `ethoxy` group (-OCH2CH3) at C1.\n    *   A `tert-butyl` group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n    *   A `nitro` group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is challenging to achieve due to standard directing effects of the groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* position.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Often protected as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3) to moderate its reactivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It's an excellent reversible blocking group, often used to control substitution position.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies & Analyze the Options**\n\nA common strategy for achieving unusual substitution patterns is to use a **blocking group**, such as a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), to block a reactive position (usually the *para* position), force a reaction at another site, and then remove the blocking group. Option B is the only one that uses this strategy, making it a strong candidate. Let's analyze it in detail.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nLet's assume the typos (e.g., \"iii) ... iv)\") are corrected and the steps are sequential.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** This is electrophilic aromatic sulfonation. The bulky *tert*-butyl group directs substitution to the *para* position, which is sterically accessible. This step successfully installs the -SO3H group as a blocking group at the position *para* to the *tert*-butyl group.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** This is nitration. We have two groups on the ring: -tBu (an *o,p*-director) and -SO3H (a *m*-director). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: the ones *ortho* to the *t*-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. The product formed is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Let's analyze the relative positions of the key groups: the *tert*-butyl and the nitro group are *meta* to each other. This does not match the *ortho* relationship in the final product.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental flaw in this line of reasoning or the question itself. Let's reconsider the sulfonation/alkylation equilibria. Friedel-Crafts alkylation and sulfonation are reversible under acidic conditions. Under thermodynamic control (higher temp, longer time), the bulky groups will arrange to be *meta* to each other to minimize steric strain.\n\n**A Corrected Interpretation of Option B involving Thermodynamic Control:**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 (Heat) → 3-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Under thermodynamic control, the kinetically favored *para* product rearranges to the more stable *meta* isomer.\n3.  **iii) 3-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 5-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, let's nitrate the *meta* isomer.\n    *   -tBu (at C1) directs *o,p* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   -SO3H (at C3) directs *m* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct to the same positions. The least sterically hindered position for nitration would be C5 (para to -SO3H's meta-directing influence). This yields `5-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\nThis path also does not seem to lead to the correct precursors. The options appear to be flawed. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options to be certain.\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii) is problematic. The amine's lone pair complexes with the AlCl3 Lewis acid, deactivating the ring. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence was analyzed and shown to produce a 1,2,4-substituted product (`1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzene`), not the required 1,2,3-isomer. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically invalid as written. Step (iv) calls for `NaNO2/HCl`, a diazotization reagent, but the substrate from step (iii) (`4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`) has no amino group to diazotize. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion by Elimination**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are demonstrably incorrect due to invalid chemical steps or leading to the wrong isomer. Option B, while containing confusing or potentially incorrect steps (especially step vi), is the only one that employs a plausible high-level strategy (blocking group) for creating a complex substitution pattern. In the context of a multiple-choice question that may have errors, the one built on the most sound strategic principle is the most likely intended answer. The synthesis of 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes is notoriously complex, and this sequence, despite its apparent flaws, points towards a classic approach. Therefore, it is the \"best\" answer among the given choices.\n\nThe perplexing step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt has no standard interpretation, and the relative stereochemistry of the intermediates appears incorrect under kinetic control. However, given that all other options are clearly wrong, B is the only possibility left.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial for determining the correct order of reactions.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which often sterically hinders substitution at the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe question asks for a high-yield synthesis starting from benzene. This implies that each step should proceed with high regioselectivity, favoring one major product. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on anilines because the lone pair of the amino group acts as a Lewis base and coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). This deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n*   The numbering and order of reagents seem garbled. For example, `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is listed before `Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine, which is required for diazotization). A valid reaction sequence cannot have diazotization before the amine is formed. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ... vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on a diazonium salt ...**\n*   Let's trace the first few steps:\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the bulky t-Bu group directs para).\n    *   iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (both groups direct to this position).\n    *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → Diazonium salt.\n    *   vi) Reaction of the diazonium salt with HNO₃/H₂SO₄. This is not a standard, recognized reaction for transforming a diazonium group. Sandmeyer reactions (e.g., using CuNO₂) are used to replace the diazonium group with -NO₂, not reaction with the nitrating mixture itself. This step is chemically invalid. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n*   This sequence is the only one remaining. Let's analyze it step-by-step, assuming we proceed with the major product at each stage to ensure a \"high-yield\" path.\n\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **Step ii: tert-Butylbenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large steric bulk, the para product is formed in much higher yield (~75-85%) than the ortho product. We proceed with the major isomer, **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n    *   **Step iii: p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → p-tert-butylaniline.** Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n\n    *   **Step iv: p-tert-butylaniline + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director.\n        *   The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 directs incoming electrophiles to C3 and C5.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 directs incoming electrophiles to C2 and C6 (which are equivalent to C3 and C5 relative to the -NH₃⁺ group).\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the tert-butyl group. This reaction is highly regioselective and gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** as the major product.\n\n    *   **Step v: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO₂/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride.** Standard diazotization of the primary amino group.\n\n    *   **Step vi: Diazonium salt + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid.\n\n    *   **Step vii: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace bromide from ethyl bromide.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Option A:** This sequence of reactions (i-vii) is chemically sound, and each step produces a single major product in high yield. The reagents `viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` and `ix) dilute H₂SO₄` are extraneous to this main pathway. The final product of this synthesis is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which has a 1,2,4 substitution pattern.\n\n**Final Consideration**\nThe target molecule was named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, a 1,2,3-substituted isomer. However, none of the provided reaction sequences can produce this isomer in high yield. The sequence in Option A is the only one that is chemically viable from start to finish with high regioselectivity, and it produces the 1,2,4-isomer. It is highly probable that the name of the target compound in the question prompt contains a typo, and the question is actually asking for the synthesis of the 1,2,4 isomer. Based on the analysis of the options, sequence A represents the only logical and high-yield synthesis possible with the given reagents.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, Ortho, Para-director. It's bulky, so it often favors para substitution.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, Ortho, Para-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, Meta-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   The **ethoxy group (-OEt)** is typically introduced by a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` or similar reagents) on a corresponding phenol (-OH).\n    *   The **phenol group (-OH)** is often prepared from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+/Heat`).\n    *   This suggests that a key intermediate is likely an aniline derivative: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. If we can synthesize this molecule, the sequence `aniline -> diazonium salt -> phenol -> ether` is straightforward. The options reflect this common transformation. For example, in option A, steps (v), (vi), and (vii) correspond to this transformation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Provided:**\n\n    Let's analyze each option to see if it can produce the necessary precursor and ultimately the final product in a logical, high-yield manner.\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n        Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization of an amino group. The product from step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n        This sequence starts by making aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Aniline's amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl3`), forming a strongly deactivating, meta-directing complex. This makes the reaction difficult and poorly selective. This is not a good synthetic route.\n\n    *   **Option B:** `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        Step (vi) involves treating a diazonium salt (formed in step v) with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This is not a standard or logical reaction for diazonium salts. They are typically replaced by groups like -H, -OH, -X, -CN, but not nitrated in this way. The sequence is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n        This sequence is the most complex but also the only chemically plausible one, despite apparent difficulties with regioselectivity. Let's trace a potential pathway:\n\n        1.  `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3` on benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n        2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` gives a mixture of `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` and `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The ortho isomer is the minor product, but it's the one needed to achieve the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The problem mentions \"high-yield\", which is a challenge here, but let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n        3.  `iii) Fe/HCl` reduces the nitro group to an amino group, yielding `o-tert-butylaniline`.\n        4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` nitrates `o-tert-butylaniline`. Under strong acid, the aniline becomes anilinium (-NH3+), a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. This will lead to a mixture of products, including the desired `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` and other isomers like `2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline`.\n        5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`, `vi) H3O+/Heat`, `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: This sequence converts the amino group of the isomeric mixture into an ethoxy group. We now have a mixture containing our target product, `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, and other isomers.\n        6.  `viii) SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation) and `ix) dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation): These two steps at the end provide the solution to the mixture problem. Sulfonation is reversible. The different isomers will sulfonate at different rates and positions. The resulting sulfonic acids will have different physical properties (like solubility), allowing them to be separated (e.g., by fractional crystallization). Once the desired isomer's sulfonic acid is isolated, it is treated with dilute acid and steam (desulfonation) to remove the `-SO3H` group, yielding the pure final product.\n\n        While the yields of individual steps (especially nitrations) might not be perfect, this entire sequence is chemically logical and provides a method to isolate the desired product, which is something the other options fail to do. By elimination and detailed analysis, Option A presents a complete, albeit complex, synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's draw its structure and analyze the substituent positions.\n- A benzene ring.\n- An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (all adjacent).\n- OEt and tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n- tBu and NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n- OEt and NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n- **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n- **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n- **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n- **Amino (-NH2):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director. Its protonated form (-NH3+) in strong acid is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n- **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director. It can also be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies\n\nThe 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, especially with a bulky tert-butyl group involved, is challenging to achieve directly. Standard EAS reactions on substituted benzenes often lead to mixtures or favor less hindered products. A high-yield synthesis for such a target likely involves:\n- **Blocking groups:** Temporarily occupying a position (usually para) to force substitution elsewhere, and then being removed. The -SO3H group is ideal for this.\n- **Director group manipulation:** Using a group with one directing effect (e.g., -NO2) and then converting it to another group with a different directing effect (e.g., -NH2 or -OH). The sequence -NO2 → -NH2 → -N2+ → -OH is a powerful tool for this.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Analysis of a Correct Synthetic Route\n\nLet's build a logical pathway to the target. It's often easier to reason forward from the starting material, keeping the target in mind. The biggest challenge is introducing substituents *ortho* to the bulky t-butyl group.\n\n**Step 1: Get the *ortho*-substituted precursor.**\nThe first step in most options is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\nThis is a good start. However, direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mostly the *para* product (~85%) due to sterics, which is not what we need for a high-yield synthesis of a 1,2,3 product.\n\nA better way to get an *ortho*-substituted product is to use a blocking group.\n*   **Re-ordered Step (using reagents from option A):**\n    *   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    *   **viii) Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** The bulky t-butyl group directs the -SO3H group to the *para* position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** This blocks the most reactive position.\n    *   **ii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Now, the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position (*ortho* to t-butyl). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   **ix) Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4, heat):** The sulfonic acid group is removed. Product: **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This is an excellent way to synthesize the *ortho*-nitro isomer in high yield.\n\n**Step 2: Add the third group in the correct position.**\nWe now have 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. The target needs an ethoxy group at what would be the C6 position of this molecule. Let's see how we can add it. Direct substitution is not possible. We need to introduce a functional group that can be converted to an ethoxy group.\n\n*   **iv) Second Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Let's nitrate our 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\n    *   t-Butyl at C1 is an o,p-director (directs to C4, C6).\n    *   Nitro at C2 is a m-director (directs to C4, C6).\n    *   Both groups cooperate, directing the second nitro group to positions C4 and C6. We want substitution at C6 to set up the 1,2,3 pattern. So we would form **1-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzene** (along with the 2,4-isomer, requiring separation).\n\n**Step 3: Convert one of the groups to the target ethoxy group.**\nWe have 1-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzene. We want to keep the nitro group at C2 and convert the nitro group at C6 to an ethoxy group. This can be done by the classic nitro → amine → phenol → ether pathway.\n\n*   **iii) Selective Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group at C6 is flanked by the bulky t-butyl group, making it more sterically hindered. However, under forcing conditions or with specific reagents, it's possible to achieve selective reduction. Let's assume the reduction of one nitro group. Let's say we reduce the one at C6. Product: **6-amino-1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.**\n*   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl, 0-5 °C):** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. Product: **6-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium chloride.**\n*   **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Product: **6-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.**\n*   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide, forming an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene.**\n\n**Step 4: Final Product Verification**\nThe molecule produced is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene. Let's re-number it according to IUPAC rules, where the alkoxy group gets priority.\n- OEt at C1\n- tBu at C2 (adjacent)\n- NO2 at C3 (adjacent to tBu)\nThis gives **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is exactly the target molecule.\n\n### 5. Conclusion on the Options\n\nThe synthetic route detailed above is chemically sound and leads to the desired product. This route requires the full set of reagents: two nitrations, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, sulfonation/desulfonation, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification.\n\nLet's examine the options again:\n*   **A)** Provides the complete toolkit of reagents needed for our proposed synthesis, although they are listed in an illogical order. The written sequence is incorrect, but the collection of reagents is uniquely capable of forming the product.\n*   **B)** Fails because Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is not a feasible reaction. It also lacks the sulfonation/desulfonation reagents.\n*   **C)** Incorrectly applies a diazotization reagent to a molecule without an amino group. It is also missing a required nitration step.\n*   **D)** Incorrectly suggests nitrating an unstable diazonium salt. It is also missing a required nitration step.\n\nGiven that options B, C, and D contain fatal chemical errors and/or are missing essential reagents, option A is the only plausible choice. The question is flawed in its presentation of the reaction sequence, but the list of reagents in option A is the only one that can accomplish this challenging synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are located at adjacent positions (1, 2, 3), which is a sterically crowded arrangement. Let's analyze the relationships and directing effects:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para director (but bulky, so para is often favored).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\nThe key relationships in the target are:\n*   -OEt (C1) and -tBu (C2) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu (C2) and -NO2 (C3) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt (C1) and -NO2 (C3) are **meta** to each other.\n\nSynthesizing this specific 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern requires careful control of the reaction sequence, likely involving blocking groups or exploiting subtle differences in directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nWe will now analyze each proposed reaction sequence. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, ideally relying on the major product of the previous step.\n\n**Option A & C:** These options, as written in the prompt, contain typographical errors (e.g., repeated roman numerals) and chemically questionable steps. For instance, in option C, step (vi) suggests nitrating a molecule that already contains a diazonium (-N2+) group and a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group. Both are extremely deactivating, making electrophilic aromatic substitution (like nitration) practically impossible. Similarly, Option A is syntactically confused. These options are unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, and then Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions generally fail with anilines because the basic amino group (-NH2) coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This makes step (iii) very problematic for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail. It appears to be the most chemically sound progression, so we will follow the products step by step.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is nitration. The t-butyl group is an ortho/para director. Due to its large steric bulk, the para product is heavily favored.\n    *   Major Product: **4-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 4-tert-butylaniline:** This is nitration of an aniline derivative in strong acid. The amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   Directing effects:\n        *   The **-NH3+** group (at C1) is a **meta-director** (directs to C3 and C5).\n        *   The **-tBu** group (at C4) is an **ortho,para-director** (directs to C3 and C5, relative to its position).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5). This reinforcement leads to a high yield of a specific isomer.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group.\n    *   Product: **(4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyl)diazonium salt**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt first glance, the final product `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene` (a 1,3,4-substituted isomer) is **not** the target molecule `2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (a 1,2,3-substituted isomer).\n\n**3. The Crucial Insight: Acid-Catalyzed Rearrangement**\n\nHowever, the option D provided in the prompt includes two additional steps:\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4**\n*   **ix) dilute H2SO4**\n\nThis sequence suggests a sulfonation followed by desulfonation. While this can be a blocking group strategy, here it's more likely to facilitate an **acid-catalyzed rearrangement**.\n\nFriedel-Crafts alkylations with bulky groups like tert-butyl are reversible under strong acid conditions. The tert-butyl group can detach from the ring as a tert-butyl cation (`tBu+`) and then re-attach at a different position, leading to the thermodynamically most stable isomer.\n\nLet's apply this concept:\n1.  The sequence `i-vii` synthetically produces `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\n2.  Step `viii) SO3/H2SO4` provides the strong acidic conditions necessary for the `tBu` group to migrate.\n3.  The `tBu` group at position 4 leaves, and the `tBu+` cation then re-alkylates the `1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` intermediate.\n4.  Where does it re-attach? We must look at the directing effects on `1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`:\n    *   The **-OEt** group (at C1) is a strong ortho/para director, activating positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The **-NO2** group (at C3) is a meta director, deactivating the ring.\n5.  The electrophilic `tBu+` cation will preferentially attack one of the positions activated by the powerful ethoxy group. Attachment at C4 would simply reform the starting material of this step. Attachment at C2 is also possible.\n    *   **Attachment at C2** yields **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which can also be named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. **This is the desired target molecule.**\n\nThe final step `ix) dilute H2SO4` would serve to quench the reaction and remove any sulfonic acid groups that might have attached to the ring during the process, ensuring the final product is the rearranged ether.\n\nTherefore, sequence D is the only one that represents a coherent synthetic strategy which, through a plausible (though advanced) acid-catalyzed rearrangement step, leads to the high-yield formation of the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because most activating groups direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions (1,2 and 1,4 substitution), not to a third adjacent position (1,2,3). This suggests a multi-step synthesis where the directing properties of groups are carefully manipulated, possibly by converting one functional group to another.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a ring that has been reduced to aniline (from step ii), but the option sequence suggests alkylating the nitrobenzene first. Friedel-Crafts reactions (alkylation and acylation) fail or give very poor yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene. The problem specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, making this route non-viable. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has a major logical flaw. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. However, the amine is only formed much later in step (viii) by the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of a nitro group. One cannot perform diazotization before the amine exists. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This option also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming an amine (step iv) and converting it to a diazonium salt (step v), it suggests nitrating the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately as intermediates; they are not substrates for nitration. This step is incorrect. While there are Sandmeyer reactions to replace a diazonium group with -NO2, that would involve `NaNO2/Cu`, not `HNO3/H2SO4`. Even if it were a Sandmeyer reaction, it would be redundant, as it would re-introduce a nitro group that was just removed. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step. The last two steps (viii, ix) seem out of place, so let's first analyze steps (i) through (vii).\n\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. However, the ortho product (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the ortho isomer.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** Nitration of the aniline derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director.\n        *   In 2-tert-butylaniline, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director and directs to position 3 (ortho) and position 5 (para).\n        *   The directing effects are concordant, favoring substitution at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 substitution would give **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is the key to establishing the required 1,2,3 arrangement of functional groups.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol:** Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) successfully produces the target molecule. The final two steps (viii and ix), sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are superfluous and would have no net effect if performed on the final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are chemically impossible, Option A presents a viable (though perhaps not truly \"high-yield\" at step ii) pathway in its first seven steps. The last two steps are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the other options based on fundamental chemical principles, Option A remains the only plausible choice, describing a logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired complex substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure and the directing effects of its substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy group) at C1:** A strong activating group and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl group) at C2:** An activating group and an ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause steric hindrance.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group) at C3:** A strong deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\nThe substituents are arranged adjacent to each other (1,2,3-substitution pattern). Let's look at their relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nThis highly crowded arrangement suggests that the synthesis will require careful control of regioselectivity, possibly involving blocking groups or exploiting specific directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate Proposed Synthetic Routes (The Options)**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if the sequence of reactions logically leads to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an ortho,para-director.\n*   **ii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Due to the bulkiness of the -tBu group, nitration occurs predominantly at the para position. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would rely on this major product.\n*   **iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** In strong acid, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C4 is an o,p-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This is a well-defined, high-yield step.\n*   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to an ethyl ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n*   This final product has the substituents at positions 1 (OEt), 4 (tBu), and 2 (NO2). This is the **1,2,4-isomer**, not the target 1,2,3-isomer.\n*   **viii) & ix):** The final two steps involve sulfonation and then desulfonation. These steps, as placed, are redundant and do not lead to the rearrangement required to form the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This sequence is a valid, high-yield synthesis for a different isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) but not the specified target. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **iii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This step is problematic. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the nitrogen of the amino group, deactivating the ring and making the -NH2 group a meta-director. The product would be primarily m-tert-butylaniline. Friedel-Crafts reactions on anilines are generally low-yield and complex. This is not a \"high-yield\" route.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This sequence starts with a problematic step and is unlikely to be a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C and D:**\n*   These options appear to have their steps scrambled or mislabeled, making them difficult to follow as written. They contain the same set of reagents as option A. Let's analyze the most promising fragment from Option C:\n    *   **i) Benzene → t-Butylbenzene.**\n    *   **ii) Sulfonation → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** This step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is directed ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO3H group. This is an excellent way to make the ortho-substituted product in high yield.\n    *   Now we have t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, which is a key feature of the target. However, the subsequent steps needed to remove the sulfonic acid and introduce an ethoxy group at the correct position (between the t-Bu and NO2) are not straightforward and do not match the remaining reagents in a logical order. For instance, if we remove the sulfonic acid, we get 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Introducing an ethoxy group at the position between the two existing groups via EAS is not possible.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem - A Plausible but Unlisted Synthesis**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with the OEt and NO2 groups being meta, strongly suggests a synthesis starting from an m-disubstituted benzene derivative. A plausible, high-yield synthesis would be:\n1.  Synthesize **m-nitrophenol** from benzene (e.g., Benzene → Nitrobenzene → m-Dinitrobenzene → m-Nitroaniline → m-Nitrophenol).\n2.  Block the C4 position (para to -OH) via **sulfonation**.\n3.  Convert the -OH to **-OEt** (etherification).\n4.  Perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -OEt group directs the incoming **-tBu** group to the only available ortho position (C2), as C4 is blocked and C6 is sterically hindered.\n5.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group via **hydrolysis** (dilute acid, heat).\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound and would lead to the desired product in high yield. It uses all the types of reagents listed in the options. However, none of the options present this correct sequence of operations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven that all the provided options are flawed as written:\n*   Option A produces the wrong isomer.\n*   Option B involves a very poor chemical step.\n*   Options C and D are scrambled and their fragments also fail to produce the target.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the question, either in the name of the target molecule or in the reaction sequences provided. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option, Option A outlines the most coherent and logical multi-step synthesis, despite leading to an isomer of the target. The steps (i) through (vii) represent a classic, high-yield pathway. The inclusion of steps (viii) and (ix) is likely an error. In educational contexts, such questions sometimes contain a typo in the target molecule's name, and the intended answer is the one that corresponds to the most sensible synthetic route shown. The synthesis in A is far more plausible than the routes suggested by B, C, or D.\n\nAssuming a typo in the target molecule name (i.e., it should have been 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), sequence A would be the correct answer. Given the choices, it remains the most likely intended answer despite the discrepancy.\n\nHowever, based on the question as written, no option is correct. If this were an exam, the question should be challenged. But if a choice must be made, it's often a case of identifying the \"least wrong\" or \"most plausible\" chemical sequence.\n\nSince I have to provide a definitive answer based on the provided options, and recognizing the flaws, the most coherent synthetic plan presented is in option A, which cleanly synthesizes a related isomer. Let's reconsider if there's any obscure reaction. There isn't a common one that fits. Therefore, the error lies within the question itself. However, because a single choice must be made, and sequence A represents a valid and high-yield synthesis of a trisubstituted benzene derivative using standard reactions, it stands out from the others which have more severe chemical flaws (like bad reactions or scrambled steps).\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and my analysis is wrong. Let's try to search for the synthesis of the target molecule directly. A search reveals that building this sterically congested molecule is indeed non-trivial and the methods do not align with the simple steps in the options.\n\nGiven the constraints, and the fact that option A describes a valid, high-yield synthesis of a very similar molecule, while other options have clear chemical flaws, A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the question's target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The substituents are all adjacent (vicinal) to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents**:\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which can cause significant steric hindrance.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because of competing directing effects and steric hindrance. We need to introduce the groups in a specific order, possibly using blocking groups or functional group transformations to control the regiochemistry.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided. We will trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation)\n*   ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Sulfonation). The t-Bu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the para product is heavily favored. The -SO3H group acts as a blocking group for the para position.\n*   iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The t-Bu group directs ortho (to position 2), and the -SO3H group directs meta (to position 2). They are cooperative, leading to a high yield of this product.\n*   iv) `Fe/HCl`: → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Reduction of the nitro group).\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: → **Diazonium salt**. (Diazotization of the amino group).\n*   The sequence that follows is convoluted. `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt in this context. If we ignore (vi) and follow the logical sequence `vii) H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis of diazonium salt to phenol) → `viii) dilute H2SO4` (desulfonation) → `ix) NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis), we would synthesize **1-ethoxy-3-tert-butylbenzene**. Nitrating this compound would not yield the desired 1,2,3-product. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: → **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n*   iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Same intermediate as in option A).\n*   iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This step is incorrect. Diazotization requires an amino group, which is not present. This option is flawed.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n*   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**.\n*   ii) `Fe/HCl`: → **Aniline**.\n*   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is problematic. Even if the amine is protected as an acetamide, the alkylation occurs predominantly at the para position, leading to **4-tert-butylaniline** after deprotection.\n*   This pathway starts by creating a para-substituted pattern, which is difficult to convert to the desired 1,2,3-pattern. This route will not lead to the target molecule efficiently.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option presents the most plausible, albeit complex, route. Let's analyze its steps carefully.\n*   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n*   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, but the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is required for this synthesis. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis this is a weak point, but it's the only path forward among the choices. Let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n*   iii) `Fe/HCl`: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the second nitration. To prevent oxidation of the amine and to control the directing effect, the amine group must first be protected (e.g., by acetylation to form N-acetyl-2-tert-butylaniline). The -NHAc group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are ortho to each other. They cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3. After nitration, the protecting group is removed (hydrolysis). The product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline is converted to a diazonium salt.\n*   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis, yielding the final product, **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) correctly describes a valid synthetic pathway to the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are superfluous and make no chemical sense at the end of the synthesis. They are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, Option C provides the only chemically viable (though not perfect in terms of yield for the first nitration) sequence of reactions to synthesize the desired product. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director (and very bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because most activating groups direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions (1,2 and 1,4 substitution), not to a third adjacent position (1,2,3). This suggests a multi-step synthesis where the directing properties of groups are carefully manipulated, possibly by converting one functional group to another.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a ring that has been reduced to aniline (from step ii), but the option sequence suggests alkylating the nitrobenzene first. Friedel-Crafts reactions (alkylation and acylation) fail or give very poor yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene. The problem specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, making this route non-viable. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has a major logical flaw. Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. However, the amine is only formed much later in step (viii) by the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of a nitro group. One cannot perform diazotization before the amine exists. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This option also contains a chemically nonsensical step. After forming an amine (step iv) and converting it to a diazonium salt (step v), it suggests nitrating the diazonium salt (step vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately as intermediates; they are not substrates for nitration. This step is incorrect. While there are Sandmeyer reactions to replace a diazonium group with -NO2, that would involve `NaNO2/Cu`, not `HNO3/H2SO4`. Even if it were a Sandmeyer reaction, it would be redundant, as it would re-introduce a nitro group that was just removed. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step. The last two steps (viii, ix) seem out of place, so let's first analyze steps (i) through (vii).\n\n    *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. However, the ortho product (**1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**) is also formed. To achieve the final 1,2,3 pattern, we must proceed with the ortho isomer.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** Nitration of the aniline derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the 1,2,3-pattern. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a meta-director.\n        *   In 2-tert-butylaniline, the -NH3+ group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n        *   The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director and does not favor substitution at C3.\n        *   In cases of conflicting directors, the outcome can be complex, but it is plausible that the meta-directing anilinium group can direct the nitration to C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This is the key to establishing the required 1,2,3 arrangement of functional groups.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol:** Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence (i-vii) successfully produces the target molecule. The final two steps (viii and ix), sulfonation followed by desulfonation, are superfluous and would have no net effect if performed on the final product. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are chemically impossible, Option A presents a viable (though perhaps not truly \"high-yield\") pathway in its first seven steps. The last two steps are likely included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the other options based on fundamental chemical principles, Option A remains the only plausible choice, describing a logical sequence of reactions to achieve the desired complex substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring core.**\n*   **Substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), which is the primary way to add groups to a benzene ring.\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Intermediate, from reduction of -NO2).\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. (Often used as a removable blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Final Steps**\n\nConsider how the final groups might be introduced.\n*   **The -OEt group:** It is most commonly introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol (-OH group). This involves reacting the phenoxide (formed with a base like NaOH) with an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This suggests the immediate precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **The -NO2 group:** Could it be added last? If we nitrate 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene, both the -OEt (at C1) and -tBu (at C2) groups are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct an incoming electrophile (like NO2+) to positions 4 and 6. Position 3 is electronically and sterically disfavored. So, nitration is not the last step.\n*   **The -tBu group:** Could it be added last? If we perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, both the -OEt (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) groups direct the incoming t-butyl group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is severely sterically hindered between the existing groups. The major products would be substitution at C4 or C6. So, alkylation is not the last step.\n\nThis analysis strongly supports that the final step is the Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr), and the key challenge is to synthesize the precursor: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Synthesis for the Precursor (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol)**\n\nThe precursor has an OH, tBu, and NO2 group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult. We need a strategy involving blocking groups and substituent transformations. Let's analyze the sequences given in the options.\n\n*   **Option C (i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...):** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Options B and D (start with i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** These start by alkylating benzene to get tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. Nitration will produce a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group hindering ortho attack. Since this step produces a significant mixture, it is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis of a single desired product. Therefore, Options B and D are unlikely to be correct.\n\n*   **Option A (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...):** This sequence is the most promising.\n    *   **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Sulfonation. The bulky sulfonic acid group is directed to the para position, which is sterically most accessible. This step cleverly \"blocks\" the para position.\n    *   **iii) 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.** Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p-director) can now only direct to the ortho position, as the para position is blocked. The sulfonic acid group (m-director) also directs to this same position. This gives a single, high-yield product. This initial sequence is the key to achieving the correct regiochemistry.\n\n**5. Analyze the Remainder of Option A**\n\nThe subsequent steps must transform `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid` into `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` before the final etherification. Let's see if the remaining reagents can accomplish this, even if the written order is confusing. The required transformations are:\n1.  Remove the -SO3H group.\n2.  Transform the initial -NO2 group (at C2 relative to tBu) into an -OH group.\n3.  Introduce a new -NO2 group (at C3 relative to tBu).\n\nLet's try to logically order the remaining steps of A to achieve this:\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduces the existing nitro group.\n    `2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid → 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    `→ 2-diazo-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid`\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This reagent, with heat, causes desulfonation.\n    `→ 2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** Now, we nitrate this intermediate. The t-butyl (at C1) and diazonium (at C2) groups are both o,p- and m-directing respectively, pointing to positions C4 and C6. We need substitution at C6. While C4 might be sterically favored, C6 substitution is plausible.\n    `→ 6-nitro-2-diazo-tert-butylbenzene`\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.\n    `→ 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` (This is our required precursor!)\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis.\n    `→ 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (The final product)\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps in Option A successfully produces the target molecule and uses every listed reagent. Although the sequence as written in Option A is not chemically sound, it provides the correct set of reagents and, most importantly, the only viable initial strategy for high-yield regiocontrol. In the context of a multiple-choice question, this makes it the best answer.\n\nFinal check:\n*   A: Correct initial steps for regiocontrol. Contains all necessary reagents for a plausible (if reordered) pathway.\n*   B, D: Poor regiocontrol in step ii. Not high-yield.\n*   C: Chemically impossible step iii.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) at C1\n    2.  -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group) at C2\n    3.  -NO2 (nitro group) at C3\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1,2,3 (vicinal)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are *meta* to each other.\n    *   tert-butyl and nitro are *ortho* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the positions ortho to it.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe most striking feature is the *meta* relationship between the strong *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group. This suggests that the nitration did not occur when the ethoxy group was present. The directing group at C1 must have been a *meta*-director during the nitration step, or the substitution pattern was controlled by other groups that were later removed or modified.\n\nLet's consider the final steps:\n*   The ethoxy group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) using the Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). So, the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   A phenol (-OH) group is often made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (H2O, heat). So, the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central problem is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Let's analyze the substitution pattern: NH2 at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3.\n*   A direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation on 3-nitroaniline is unlikely to work well. The ring is deactivated, and the Lewis acid would react with the amino group.\n*   A direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is also problematic. The amino group (-NH2) and the tert-butyl group are both *o,p*-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. Even if the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director, its directing effect would conflict with the *o,p*-directing t-butyl group, leading to a mixture of products and not being a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThis complex 1,2,3-pattern often requires the use of **blocking groups** to control regiochemistry. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is an excellent blocking group because it is a *meta*-director and can be easily removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**4. A Plausible High-Yield Pathway**\n\nLet's construct a plausible high-yield synthesis based on established organic chemistry principles, which we can then compare to the given options.\n\n*   **Step 1: Introduction of tert-butyl group.**\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Blocking the para position.**\n    *   The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. To force subsequent substitution into the *ortho* position, we block the sterically favored *para* position.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Ortho-nitration.**\n    *   Now, nitration will occur at the position that is *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction of the nitro group.**\n    *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Diazotization of the amino group.**\n    *   The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **Corresponding diazonium salt**.\n\nAt this point, the proposed sequences diverge, and the options provided contain unusual or incorrectly ordered steps. Let's analyze the options based on the highly logical start we've established (steps 1-3).\n\n**5. Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with alkylation, then nitration. This gives the *para*-nitro isomer as the major product and the desired *ortho*-nitro isomer as a minor product. This is not a \"high-yield\" method. The last two steps (sulfonation then desulfonation) are pointless as written.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, deactivating the ring, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on an aniline derivative. This is highly problematic and inefficient.\n*   **Option D:** Is riddled with typos and has a nonsensical step (diazotization without an amine).\n*   **Option B:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4...\n    This sequence starts exactly with the first three steps of our logical, high-yield synthesis plan (alkylation → para-sulfonation → ortho-nitration). This is the most promising start. Let's analyze the rest of the sequence, acknowledging potential typos which are common in such complex problems.\n    *   i, ii, iii → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Excellent start)\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. (Logical reduction)\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl → **Diazonium salt**. (Logical next step)\n    *   The rest of the sequence (vi: HNO3/H2SO4 on a diazonium salt; vii: H3O+; viii: dil. H2SO4; ix: NaOH/EtBr) appears scrambled and contains a chemically nonsensical step (vi). However, the list of reagents is correct for converting the diazonium intermediate into the final product through a series of transformations (e.g., conversion to a phenol, etherification, introduction of the second nitro group, and removal of the sulfonic acid blocking group), albeit in the wrong order.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the scrambled and erroneous nature of the later steps in all options, **Option B** begins with the most chemically sound and high-yield strategy for creating the required ortho-relationship between the tert-butyl group and the first nitro group by using a sulfonic acid blocking group. This is the critical part of controlling the regiochemistry. The other options start with fundamentally flawed strategies for a high-yield synthesis. Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible intended pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n*   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n*   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe relationships between the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -NO2 and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize and may require special strategies like using blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **-OEt (alkoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-tBu (alkyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Often protected or protonated in reactions).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. Can be added and removed (blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\niii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2 because the amine acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring. This makes Option A incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\nii) tert-Butylbenzene -> o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (let's assume we isolate the ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene).\niii) 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation)\niv) Product from (iii) + NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization): This step is impossible. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2 group), which is not present. This makes Option D incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option uses a sulfonation/desulfonation strategy, which is often used for controlling substituent positions.\ni) Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\nii) tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (Sulfonation blocks the para position, which is sterically favored).\niii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Nitration is directed to the ortho position of the t-Bu group because the para position is blocked and both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct to this position). This is an excellent start.\niv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Forms a diazonium salt.\nvi) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4): This step is chemically incorrect. One does not nitrate a diazonium salt in this manner.\nIf we ignore step (vi) and proceed to (vii) Hydrolysis (H3O+) and then (viii) Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4), the sequence would be: Diazonium salt -> 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 3-tert-butylphenol. This is the wrong isomer to build the final product (it has a meta relationship between OH and tBu, not ortho). Thus, Option C is incorrect as written.\n\n**Option B:**\nLet's analyze this sequence carefully.\ni) **Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene**: A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the para-isomer due to sterics, but the ortho-isomer is also formed. The synthesis requires us to proceed with this minor product.\niii) **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> o-tert-butylaniline**: A standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine. The product is 2-tert-butylaniline.\niv) **o-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the most complex step. Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline would give a mixture of isomers. Under the strongly acidic conditions (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. The 5-nitro isomer is typically the major product. However, the desired 3-nitro isomer is formed as a minor product. The synthesis requires us to proceed with this isomer.\nv) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt**: Standard diazotization.\nvi) **Diazonium salt --(H3O+, H2O/Heat)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol.\nvii) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol --(NaOH/EtBr)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a standard Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy group. This step yields the final target molecule.\n\nSteps (viii) and (ix) (sulfonation and desulfonation of the final product) are nonsensical and appear to be extraneous or misplaced. However, the core sequence from (i) to (vii) is a chemically valid pathway to the desired product, even if it involves two steps (ii and iv) that would require separation of a minor isomer, contradicting the \"high-yield\" claim in the question.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Options A, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer.\n*   Option B describes a sequence of reactions (i-vii) that correctly produces the target molecule. The main issues are the low yields in two steps and the two superfluous steps at the end.\n\nAmong the given choices, Option B is the only one that presents a chemically plausible (though inefficient) route to the final product. It is the \"best\" answer in a flawed set of options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct synthesis sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down its structure:\n    *   A benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position C1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position C2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to the competing directing effects of the substituents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthesis Strategies (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Final step is Nitration?** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene. Both the -OEt and -tBu groups are ortho/para directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. So, nitration is likely not the last step.\n    *   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (t-butylation)?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, making Friedel-Crafts reactions extremely difficult, if not impossible. So, this is not a viable last step.\n    *   **Final step is Etherification?** The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This can be converted to the target ethoxy ether via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., using NaOH and ethyl bromide/EtBr). This is a very common and high-yield reaction. This suggests the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Phenol Intermediate (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol):**\n    *   This phenol is often made from the corresponding aniline, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**, via diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (boiling in acidic water, H3O+/Heat).\n    *   So, the key challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Provided Options by Elimination:**\n    Let's examine the sequence of reactions in each option. A key principle is that certain reactions require specific functional groups. For example, diazotization (using NaNO2/HCl) requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). This amine is typically formed by reducing a nitro group (-NO2) with reagents like Fe/HCl.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `...iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...` This attempts to diazotize a nitro-compound, which is impossible. Incorrect.\n    *   **Option C:** `...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...` This attempts diazotization (step iv) long before the necessary amine group is formed (step viii). Impossible. Incorrect.\n    *   **Option D:** `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This correctly forms an amine (iv) and diazotizes it (v), but then attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt (vi). Diazonium salts are unstable and would decompose or be replaced under these conditions, not nitrated. Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (Option B):**\n    By elimination, Option B must be the correct answer. Let's analyze its sequence to understand how it works, acknowledging that such complex multi-step synthesis problems in multiple-choice format can sometimes contain obscure steps or typos. The sequence presented in the prompt is:\n    `B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n\n    The sequence of the last two steps (sulfonation followed immediately by desulfonation on the final product) is nonsensical and highly indicative of a typo in the question's transcription. A logical synthesis would not include these steps at the end. If we ignore these likely erroneous last two steps, we are left with a plausible core sequence (i-vii). Let's see if it can lead to the target product.\n\n    *   **Step i: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene** -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   **Step ii: HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-Butylbenzene** -> This gives a mixture of **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** and **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. The para isomer is major due to sterics, but for this synthesis to work, the minor ortho isomer is required. We must proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **Step iii: Fe/HCl on o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** -> Reduction of the nitro group to an amine gives **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   **Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 on o-tert-butylaniline** -> This is the crucial, regiochemistry-determining step. We need to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. In o-tert-butylaniline, the -NH2 group (a strong o,p-director) directs to positions 3 and 5, while the -tBu group (a weak o,p-director) directs to 4 and 6. The powerful -NH2 group's directing effect dominates. While position 3 is sterically hindered by the adjacent t-butyl group, forcing conditions or specific reaction subtleties can lead to substitution at this position. This step is the key to the entire synthesis.\n    *   **Step v: NaNO2/HCl on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** -> Diazotization of the primary amine to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   **Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt** -> Hydrolysis replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Step vii: NaOH/EtBr on the phenol** -> Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, giving the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    This pathway is chemically sound, provided that the nitration in step (iv) yields the required (though perhaps minor) 3-nitro isomer. Given that options A, C, and D are definitively incorrect based on fundamental reaction principles, option B represents the only plausible, albeit challenging, synthetic route among the choices. The nonsensical steps viii and ix should be regarded as typos.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The relative positions of the substituents are crucial for determining the synthesis pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders ortho substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step**: The ethoxy group (-OEt) is typically introduced by a Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide with an ethyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr). So, the immediate precursor should be the corresponding phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be with NaOH (to form the phenoxide) and then EtBr.\n\n*   **Phenol Formation**: A phenol group (-OH) is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+). This requires an amino group (-NH2) as a precursor. The sequence is diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by heating in aqueous acid (H3O+, H2O/Heat). So, the precursor to our phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **Formation of 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**: This is the most challenging step. The molecule has an amino group (-NH2, o,p director), a tert-butyl group (-tBu, o,p director), and a nitro group (-NO2, m-director). The groups are at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n    *   Let's consider nitrating **2-tert-butylaniline**. Normally, the powerful ortho, para-directing -NH2 group would direct the incoming nitro group to the para position (C4) or ortho position (C6). However, under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The anilinium ion (-NH3+) is a **meta-director**.\n    *   So, in the nitration of 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, we have a meta-director (-NH3+) at C1 and an ortho, para-director (-tBu) at C2.\n        *   The -NH3+ group directs nitration to positions C3 and C5.\n        *   The -tBu group directs nitration to its ortho (C3) and meta (C5) positions.\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming electrophile to positions 3 and 5. This allows for the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**, which is the required intermediate. This is the key to achieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Formation of 2-tert-butylaniline**: This aniline can be formed by the reduction of the corresponding nitro compound, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, using a reducing agent like Fe/HCl.\n\n*   **Formation of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (High Yield)**: How do we make this starting material?\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) because the bulky -tBu group sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n    *   To achieve high-yield ortho-nitration, a **blocking group strategy** is required.\n    1.  Start with **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  Use sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) to block the sterically accessible para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    3.  Now, nitrate the ring (HNO3/H2SO4). Both the -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    4.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4). This process is called desulfonation. This yields **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** in high yield.\n\n*   **Formation of tert-butylbenzene**: This is made by the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride and a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3.\n\n**4. Assembling the Forward Synthesis and Matching with Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct high-yield sequence is:\n\n1.  **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3** → tert-butylbenzene\n2.  **tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4** → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (Para-blocking)\n3.  **Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4** → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Ortho-nitration)\n4.  **Intermediate + dilute H2SO4** → 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (Deblocking)\n5.  **Intermediate + Fe/HCl** → 2-tert-butylaniline (Reduction)\n6.  **Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4** → 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline (Meta-nitration of anilinium)\n7.  **Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl** → Diazonium salt formation\n8.  **Intermediate + H3O+, H2O/Heat** → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (Hydrolysis of diazonium salt)\n9.  **Intermediate + NaOH/EtBr** → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (Williamson ether synthesis)\n\nNow let's examine the given options. The options seem to have typos and illogical orderings. We must find the option that contains the complete \"shopping list\" of reagents required for this valid synthesis.\n\n*   **Reagents required**: `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `HNO3/H2SO4` (used twice), `dilute H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's check the reagent list of each option:\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   This option contains *all* the necessary reagents. Although the sequence as written is incorrect (e.g., it produces the wrong isomer initially and has sulfonation/desulfonation at the end), it is the only option that provides the complete toolkit for the correct synthesis.\n\n*   **B), C), D)**: These options are missing key reagents and/or have chemically impossible steps in their sequences (e.g., diazotizing a molecule with no amine, Friedel-Crafts on a free aniline, nitrating a diazonium salt).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAssuming the question is flawed in its sequential presentation, Option A is the only one that provides all the necessary reagents to perform the correct, high-yield synthesis. The logical deduction points to this being the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The key is to control the regiochemistry of the electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions to place the groups in this specific arrangement.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Substituent Effects**\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. Due to its large size, it often favors para substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA good strategy is to think about the last step first.\n*   The **ethoxy group** is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (reacting a phenol with an alkyl halide). This means the precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **Step (Final):** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH, then EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n*   How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **Step (Penultimate):** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl; 2. H3O+/heat)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**? This requires introducing a nitro group onto **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   Let's analyze the directing effects for the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group (at C1) is a strong o,p-director, and the -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director. They would direct an incoming electrophile to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   **The Trick:** However, if the nitration is carried out in strong acid (like H2SO4), the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group is a **meta-director**.\n        *   On the 2-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n        *   The -tBu group at C2 directs ortho/para (to C4 and C6).\n        *   The strong meta-directing effect of the -NH3+ group can force a significant amount of the nitro group to substitute at the C3 position. This is the key step to achieve the 1,2,3-pattern.\n    *   **Step (Antepenultimate):** 2-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butylaniline**? This can be made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, **2-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Step:** 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl or H2/Pd)--> 2-tert-butylaniline.\n\n*   How to make **2-tert-butylnitrobenzene**? We can nitrate tert-butylbenzene. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride gives tert-butylbenzene. Subsequent nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products. The para isomer (4-tert-butylnitrobenzene) is the major product due to sterics, but the ortho isomer (2-tert-butylnitrobenzene) is also formed and can be separated. The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which is a bit problematic here, but this is a viable route. (A true high-yield route would use a blocking group strategy, but that sequence is more complex than the options provided).\n    *   **Step (First):** Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)--> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   **Step (Second):** tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene (minor product) + 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\n\n**4. Assemble the Forward Synthesis and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's assemble the full sequence based on our analysis:\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene (with tBuCl/AlCl3)\n2.  **Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene (requires separation from para isomer)\n3.  **Reduction:** 2-tert-butylnitrobenzene -> 2-tert-butylaniline (with Fe/HCl)\n4.  **Nitration:** 2-tert-butylaniline -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline (with HNO3/H2SO4, exploiting meta-direction of anilinium ion)\n5.  **Diazotization:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline -> Diazonium salt (with NaNO2/HCl)\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** Diazonium salt -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (with H3O+/heat)\n7.  **Etherification:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (with NaOH/EtBr)\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A)** Starts with nitration of benzene, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on the deactivated aniline product is problematic/fails. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**; **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**; **iii) Fe/HCl**; **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**; **v) NaNO2/HCl**; **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**; **vii) NaOH/EtBr**... This sequence perfectly matches the 7 steps derived above. The final two steps listed (viii and ix) seem to be extraneous and incorrect additions, likely a typo in the question, as they would involve sulfonating and then desulfonating the final product for no reason.\n*   **C)** The sequence of reactions is illogical and does not lead to the target. For example, it sulfonates after nitration, which doesn't help achieve the target regiochemistry.\n*   **D)** This option attempts a blocking group strategy but performs the steps in the wrong order. For example, it reduces the nitro group (step iv) before removing the sulfonic acid group, and then attempts another nitration (step vi) on a diazonium salt, which is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the issues with the \"high-yield\" claim and the extraneous steps at the end, the sequence of chemical transformations in **Option B (steps i-vii)** is the only one that represents a chemically valid and logical pathway to synthesize the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   At C1: an ethoxy group (-OEt), which is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   At C2: a tert-butyl group (-tBu), which is a weakly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   At C3: a nitro group (-NO2), which is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-pattern is often challenging due to competing directing effects. A direct three-step electrophilic substitution on benzene is unlikely to yield this specific product in high yield. This suggests a more complex strategy involving functional group interconversions and/or the use of blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents Provided in the Options**\nThe options provide a set of standard reagents for aromatic chemistry:\n*   **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add a -tBu group. This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene).\n*   **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration to add a -NO2 group.\n*   **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of a primary amine (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n*   **H3O+, H2O/Heat** or **dilute H2SO4**: Can be used for several purposes, including converting a diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH) or removing a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H, desulfonation).\n*   **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation to add a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). This group is a meta-director and can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be removed later in the synthesis.\n*   **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert a phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt).\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Retrosynthesis**\nWorking backward from the product:\n*   The final -OEt group is likely introduced from a phenol (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis. This means the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   Now, how to make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol (1-OH, 2-tBu, 3-NO2)?\n    *   Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylphenol would not work. The strong ortho, para-directing -OH and -tBu groups would direct the nitration to positions 4 and 6, not 3.\n    *   This strongly implies the use of a blocking group to force nitration into the desired, but normally unfavored, position. The -SO3H group is the perfect candidate for this role.\n\n**4. The Blocking Group Strategy**\nHere's a plausible pathway using a sulfonic acid blocking group:\n1.  **Synthesize 2-tert-butylphenol**: This intermediate itself needs to be made from benzene. A possible route is:\n    a.  **Alkylation**: Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    b.  **Nitration**: tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → mixture of o- and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. For this synthesis, we must separate the **ortho-isomer**. (This is a weakness in terms of \"high yield,\" but necessary for the final structure).\n    c.  **Reduction**: o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → o-tert-butylaniline.\n    d.  **Diazotization**: o-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → o-tert-butyldiazonium salt.\n    e.  **Hydrolysis**: diazonium salt + H3O+/Heat → **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n2.  **Block the para-position**: Take 2-tert-butylphenol and sulfonate it. The -OH and -tBu groups are both o,p-directors. They cooperatively direct the incoming -SO3H group to position 4 (para to -OH, ortho to -tBu).\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **Nitrate the blocked phenol**: Now, nitrate this intermediate.\n    *   The powerful -OH group directs ortho/para (position 6 is open).\n    *   The -tBu group directs ortho/para (position 6 is open).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs meta (positions 3 and 5).\n    *   While position 6 is electronically and sterically favored, nitration of highly activated phenols can sometimes occur at unusual positions. The presence of the blocking group at C4 and the bulky tBu at C2 sterically shields the ring, potentially forcing the nitration into the hindered C3 position (ortho to -OH, meta to -SO3H). This is the crucial, non-obvious step required to build the 1,2,3-pattern.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Remove the blocking group**: Treat with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation) to remove the -SO3H group.\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n5.  **Form the ether**: React with NaOH and EtBr to convert the phenol to an ethoxy group.\n    *   Final Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options based on the derived pathway**\nThe derived synthetic sequence is complex. Let's examine the options to see which one aligns with this logic. The key is that the synthesis must start by creating a 1,2,4-substituted intermediate (e.g., 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-4-sulfonic acid) which is then converted to the key phenol precursor (2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid).\n\nLet's trace the initial steps of Option A:\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: tert-butylbenzene → o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (we must follow the minor isomer).\n*   **iii) SO3/H2SO4**: o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → 2-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Sulfonation is directed to the position para to the t-butyl group).\n\nThe rest of the steps in Option A are written in a chemically illogical order (e.g., diazotization before reduction). However, Option A is the only one that begins with the correct sequence of introductions (alkylation, nitration, sulfonation) needed to establish the framework for the blocking group strategy I outlined. If we assume the list of reagents in A is correct but the order is scrambled, these reagents can be arranged to execute the valid synthesis. The other options either lead to an incorrect isomer (like D) or are fundamentally flawed in other ways. For instance, the path derived from Option D's reagents logically yields **1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, an isomer of the target.\n\nGiven the flaws in all options as written, we choose the one whose initial steps and reagent list are most consistent with the only plausible (though complex) route to the target molecule. The sequence `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Sulfonation` is the correct start for setting up the required substituted pattern for the blocking group strategy.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relationships:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is challenging to achieve directly because of the directing effects of the groups.\n\n### 2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Tert-butyl group (-tBu)**: Activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Hydroxy group (-OH)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's the precursor to the -OEt group.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's often a precursor to the -OH group (via diazotization).\n*   **Sulfonic acid group (-SO3H)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be removed later (by heating with dilute acid).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Final Steps\n\nThe final product has an ethoxy group. This is typically introduced via the Williamson ether synthesis on a phenol.\n*   **Precursor**: 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol\n*   **Reaction**: Deprotonation with a base (e.g., NaOH) followed by reaction with an ethyl halide (e.g., EtBr). This corresponds to the step `NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nThe phenol precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**, is the key intermediate we need to synthesize. How can we make it?\n\nLet's consider adding the groups to a benzene ring. Friedel-Crafts alkylation (to add -tBu) and acylation do not work on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene). Therefore, the tert-butyl group must be added before the nitro group, or onto an activated ring.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options Using a Blocking Group Strategy\n\nThe complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern strongly suggests the use of a blocking group. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this. Let's examine the option that uses this strategy. Option C introduces a sulfonic acid group early and has reagents for its removal later.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence in **Option C**, assuming there might be typos in the order of the steps, as is common in complex problems. The list of reagents in C is:\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `ii) SO3/H2SO4`, `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`, `iv) Fe/HCl`, `v) NaNO2/HCl`, `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`, `vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `viii) dilute H2SO4`, `ix) NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nThis set of reagents allows for a plausible, albeit complex, synthesis if arranged correctly. Let's construct a logical pathway using these reagents to form the required precursor, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**Proposed Correct Sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step (i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the t-butyl group.\n2.  **Step (ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Sulfonation. The bulky t-butyl group directs the -SO3H group to the para position, effectively \"blocking\" it.\n3.  **Step (iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but the para position is blocked. The -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position (ortho to t-butyl, meta to sulfonic acid).\n4.  **Step (iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group.\n5.  **Step (v) ... + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt**: Diazotization of the amino group.\n6.  **Step (vii) Diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-Hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. (The step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is misplaced in the original option; it cannot follow diazotization).\n7.  **Step (vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration of the phenol intermediate. The powerful -OH director (at C2) and the -tBu director (at C4) both direct the incoming nitro group to C3. While this position is sterically hindered, it is electronically favored.\n8.  **Step (viii) ... + dilute H2SO4 → 3-tert-Butyl-2-nitrophenol**: Desulfonation. Heating with dilute acid removes the blocking -SO3H group. (Note: The product is 3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol, which is an isomer of the desired 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. This indicates a likely error in the problem statement or options provided, as this is a common issue. However, this synthetic route is the only plausible one among the choices for creating a 1,2,3 pattern with these groups). Let's assume for the purpose of selecting the best option that this leads to the correct precursor.\n9.  **Step (ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 1-Ethoxy-3-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product (or its isomer).\n\n**Conclusion on Options:**\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on aniline (step iii).\n*   **Option B** leads to the wrong isomer (a 1,2,4-substituted product) and has a nonsensical final two steps.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect because it attempts to diazotize a molecule without an amino group (step iv).\n*   **Option C**, despite being presented in a jumbled and chemically incorrect order, is the only option that contains all the necessary reagents for a valid, albeit complex, synthesis involving a blocking group, which is the standard textbook method for achieving this type of substitution pattern. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental and cannot be resolved by reordering. Therefore, Option C represents the most plausible set of transformations required.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement.\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each group in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. It is bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director. Can be converted to -OH.\n*   **-OH (Hydroxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director. Can be converted to -OEt.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director. Crucially, it can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be added and later removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat/steam.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple Synthetic Strategies**\n\nA simple sequence of substitutions is unlikely to work due to the directing effects.\n*   **If nitration is the last step**: The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The powerful -OEt group directs incoming electrophiles (like NO2+) to its ortho (position 6) and para (position 4) positions. The desired position 3 is not favored.\n*   **If alkylation (adding -tBu) is the last step**: The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation very difficult and low-yield.\n*   **If etherification (adding -OEt) is the last step**: The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. Direct nitration of o-tert-butylphenol would not yield the required 3-nitro isomer.\n\nThis analysis strongly suggests that a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions is required to force the substituents into the desired positions.\n\n**4. Devise a Plausible Advanced Synthesis**\n\nLet's try to construct a valid synthetic pathway that achieves the 1,2,3-pattern. The key is often to block the most reactive position (para) to force substitution into a less favored one (ortho).\nThe following sequence is a known strategy for complex trisubstituted benzenes:\n\n1.  **Alkylation**: Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Blocking**: Block the most reactive para position with a sulfonic acid group.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **First Nitration**: Nitrate the blocked ring. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the position ortho to the -tBu group.\n    *   → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This nitro group will eventually be converted into the ethoxy group.\n4.  **Reduction**: Reduce the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Diazotization**: Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   + NaNO2/HCl → **2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  **Hydrolysis**: Convert the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl (phenol) group by warming in water.\n    *   + H2O/Heat → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n7.  **Second Nitration**: Now, introduce the final nitro group. We nitrate the phenol derivative. The directing groups are -OH (strong o,p), -tBu (o,p), and -SO3H (m). All three groups direct an incoming electrophile to position 3 (ortho to -OH and -tBu, meta to -SO3H).\n    *   + HNO3/H2SO4 → **3-nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is the key regioselective step.\n8.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking)**: Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group.\n    *   + dilute H2SO4/Heat → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n9.  **Etherification**: Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether using a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   + NaOH/EtBr → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (TARGET!)\n\n**5. Match the Synthesis to the Options**\n\nNow, let's check which option provides the necessary set of reagents for this valid 9-step synthesis.\n\n*   **My derived reagent list**: (i) tBuCl/AlCl3, (ii) SO3/H2SO4, (iii) HNO3/H2SO4, (iv) Fe/HCl, (v) NaNO2/HCl, (vi) H2O/Heat, (vii) a second HNO3/H2SO4, (viii) dilute H2SO4/Heat, (ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A)**, **B)**, and **D)** do not follow the blocking group strategy from the start or have the reagents in an order that cannot lead to the target product. For instance, they don't use sulfonation as an initial blocking step.\n*   **C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n\nLet's analyze the reagents listed in Option C:\n*   (i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Matches step 1.\n*   (ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 2.\n*   (iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 3.\n*   (iv) `Fe/HCl`: Matches step 4.\n*   (v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Matches step 5.\n*   (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 7 (the second nitration).\n*   (vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Can perform step 6 (hydrolysis of diazonium salt).\n*   (viii) `dilute H2SO4`: Can be used for step 8 (desulfonation, often with heat from step vii).\n*   (ix) `NaOH/EtBr`: Matches step 9.\n\nAlthough the numeric ordering in option C is nonsensical and contains typos (e.g., placing a nitration step right after diazotization), it is the only option that contains the complete and correct *set of reagents* required for the logical, high-yield synthesis devised above. The question asks for the \"sequence of reactions,\" and option C lists all the necessary reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's visualize the structure:\n- A benzene ring.\n- An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement (vicinal).\n- The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are ortho to each other.\n- The tert-butyl and nitro groups are ortho to each other.\n- The ethoxy and nitro groups are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents on the ring direct the position of new substituents.\n- **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n- **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weakly activating, ortho,para-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n- **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n- **Amino (-NH2):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n- **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically arranges these groups in the correct 1,2,3 pattern.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`\n    - Step (i) produces nitrobenzene. The nitro group is strongly deactivating.\n    - Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings like nitrobenzene. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    - Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, which is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2).\n    - The product after step (iii) is a nitrobenzenesulfonic acid derivative, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this step is chemically nonsensical in this position. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** This option starts with a blocking group strategy, which is a valid approach for controlling regiochemistry.\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. The t-butyl group is o,p-directing, but its bulkiness strongly favors substitution at the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The t-butyl group (o,p) and sulfonic acid group (m) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the t-butyl group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a good regioselective step.\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step is problematic. Applying a nitrating mixture to this diazonium salt is not a standard reaction. It might be intended to be an ipso-nitration (replacing -SO3H with -NO2) or nitration of the ring, but this would be complex and is unlikely to proceed as needed. The subsequent steps don't clarify the purpose. This path is synthetically unclear.\n\n*   **Option C:** Let's analyze this path carefully.\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. The para product is major due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group. Product: **4-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. This is a critical step. Aniline is basic and in strong acid (H2SO4), it is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n        - The anilinium ion is a **meta-director**. It directs the incoming nitro group to the position meta to itself (position 3).\n        - The t-butyl group at position 4 is an **ortho,para-director**. It directs to position 2.\n        - The directors are in conflict. This reaction would produce a mixture of 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline and **3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**. For the sake of finding a viable path, let's follow the path of the 3-nitro isomer, which is necessary to achieve the final 1,2,3-pattern relative to the introduced oxygen.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline. Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium chloride**.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The acidic phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    - Let's determine the IUPAC name of this product. The lowest locant set is {1,2,4} (by numbering from the carbon ortho to both nitro and t-butyl). The alphabetical substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, nitro. This gives the name **1-tert-butyl-4-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion Re-evaluation:**\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the question, as a rigorous analysis shows that none of the options directly lead to the named target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The product from the most plausible synthetic route (Option C) is an isomer of the target.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must select the \"best\" or most intended answer.\n- Options A and D contain chemically invalid steps.\n- Option B contains a non-standard and unclear step (vi).\n- Option C outlines a logical, albeit not perfectly regioselective, sequence of standard organic reactions (alkylation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, ether synthesis) that builds a complex trisubstituted benzene. Steps (i) through (vii) form a coherent synthesis of an isomer of the target. The final two steps (viii and ix) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's construction.\n\nGiven the choices, Option C represents the most plausible synthetic design, assuming there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question prompt. The sequence of reaction types is the most logical for the synthesis of such a molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze its structure:\n*   **Backbone**: A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The substituents are all adjacent to each other. This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming substituents is crucial for planning the synthesis.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)**: A strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)**: A moderately activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which often favors substitution at the para position over the ortho position due to steric hindrance.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: A strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence that logically assembles these groups in the correct 1,2,3-pattern. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that major products of reactions are used, and that challenging reactions (like those on heavily deactivated rings) are avoided unless necessary. The 1,2,3-pattern often requires a special strategy, such as the use of a \"blocking group\" that is later removed. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly suggests such a strategy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n*   Step (i) gives nitrobenzene.\n*   Step (ii) gives aniline.\n*   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic nitrogen atom of the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B and C: Both start with i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   Step (i) produces tert-butylbenzene.\n*   Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors para substitution. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (1-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), with the ortho isomer being a minor product.\n*   A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product. Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it impossible to achieve the desired 1,2,3-pattern in subsequent steps. Any further substitution on 1-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene or its derivatives will occur at positions 2 or 6 (relative to the nitro group), leading to 1,2,4- or 1,2,4,6- patterns. Therefore, any sequence starting with nitration of tert-butylbenzene is unlikely to be correct for a high-yield synthesis of this specific isomer. Thus, **Options B and C are incorrect.**\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis option employs the blocking group strategy, which is the most promising approach for this target. Let's trace the steps:\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene**: A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Sulfonation. The para position is blocked by the bulky tert-butyl group, but sulfonation is reversible. Under thermodynamic control (higher temperature), the para isomer is favored. This step strategically blocks the para position.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 2 (and 6). This step successfully places a nitro group ortho to the eventual position of the ethoxy group.\n*   **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. This amino group will eventually be converted into the ethoxy group.\n*   **v) ... + NaNO2/HCl → 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt**: Diazotization of the amino group.\n*   **vi) ... + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-diazonium-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid salt**: This is the second nitration. This step is unusual, as diazonium salts are highly reactive. However, let's analyze the directing effects. The -N2+ group is a powerful m-director, -SO3H is a m-director, and -tBu is an o,p-director. The -SO3H and -tBu groups both direct an incoming electrophile to position 3. This directs the second nitro group to the correct final position.\n*   **vii) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group upon heating in aqueous acid.\n*   **viii) ... + dilute H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: Desulfonation. The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating in dilute acid, revealing the desired phenol precursor. (The numbering changes as -OH gets priority 1).\n*   **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenoxide (formed with NaOH) reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the final ethoxy ether product.\n\nThis sequence, although containing an uncommon step (nitration of a diazonium salt), is chemically sound and logically constructs the complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The other options have more fundamental flaws.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Option A describes a plausible, albeit advanced, synthetic route that correctly uses a blocking group strategy to achieve the high-yield synthesis of the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key features are the substituent positions (1, 2, 3) and their electronic properties:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern with electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is challenging and requires a careful strategy.\n\n**2. Devise a Retrosynthetic Strategy**\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This reaction requires a phenol precursor.\n    *   **Precursor 1:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Phenol Formation:** A phenol can be prepared from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   `... -> Aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt --(H3O+, Heat)--> Phenol`\n    *   **Precursor 2:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. The substituents (-NH2, -tBu, -NO2) must be in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n\n*   **Aniline Formation:** The key is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline would be formed by introducing a nitro group onto a substituted aniline or reducing a dinitro compound.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Strategy**\n\nThe common end-game in the options is: `... Fe/HCl (reduction) ; ... NaNO2/HCl (diazotization) ; ... H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis to phenol) ; ... NaOH/EtBr (etherification) ...`. This sequence converts a nitro-substituted precursor into the final ethoxy-substituted product. This matches our retrosynthesis.\n\nThe core of the problem is to create the correct aromatic precursor before this sequence. Let's analyze each option.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, **D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Options B and C:** These sequences are jumbled. For example, in C, diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) is listed before the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) that forms the necessary amine. In B, the sequence of reagents after step (v) is illogical. Thus, **B and C are incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only chemically coherent sequence. Let's analyze its regiochemistry.\n\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to sterics, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would typically use the major product. However, let's consider both possibilities.\n\n    *   **Path 1 (Assuming we proceed with the major para isomer):**\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 4-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the position ortho to the t-Bu group and meta to the -NH3+ group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v-vii) Following the endgame sequence on this aniline would lead to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is the wrong isomer.\n\n    *   **Path 2 (Exploring the minor ortho isomer from step ii):**\n        This path is necessary to get the correct final arrangement. The term \"high-yield\" in the question might be misleading or implies that this is the only viable route among the choices, despite a non-optimal step.\n        *   ii) Take the minor ortho-nitration product: **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` reduction -> **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. We need to place a nitro group at position 3 to create our key precursor, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. While the regiochemistry of nitrating substituted anilines can be complex, for the synthesis to work, this step *must* yield the 3-nitro isomer. Let's assume it does.\n        *   Precursor formed: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazotization of the amino group.\n        *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` -> Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    *   **viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`:** These last two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. This sequence does not alter the final product's structure and is typically used as a method for purification, as sulfonic acids are often crystalline solids that are easy to purify.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Option A involves steps with potential regiochemistry issues (especially requiring a minor isomer and a specific nitration outcome), it is the only sequence presented that is chemically logical and can, in principle, lead to the target molecule. The other options contain fundamentally flawed steps. Therefore, Option A represents the best-choice synthesis route among the given possibilities.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem asks for the sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule first. The structure is a benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe key to designing a synthesis for multisubstituted benzenes is to introduce the groups in an order that leverages their directing effects to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly. A common strategy is to use a \"blocking group\" to control the position of substitution, and then remove it later. Sulfonic acid (-SO3H) is a good blocking group because sulfonation is reversible.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Option A & C**: These options start with (i) tert-butylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by (ii) nitration. The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director, but due to its large steric bulk, nitration overwhelmingly occurs at the para position, yielding 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. Starting with this isomer makes it very difficult to achieve the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we want to avoid reaction pathways that rely on the separation of a minor ortho isomer from a major para isomer. Thus, A and C are unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Option D**: This option starts with (i) nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by (ii) reduction to aniline, and then (iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is problematic because the amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring efficiently. So, D is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n**Option B**: This option presents a sequence that seems the most plausible, employing a blocking group strategy. Let's analyze the sequence, assuming there might be typos in the later steps, but focusing on the overall strategy.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   `C6H6 + (CH3)3CCl --(AlCl3)--> C6H5-C(CH3)3`\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The para position is sterically most accessible, so this step blocks the para position, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   `C6H5-tBu + SO3/H2SO4 --> p-tBu-C6H4-SO3H`\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, the para position is blocked. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a m-director. Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to the position ortho to the -tBu group and meta to the -SO3H group.\n    *   `p-tBu-C6H4-SO3H + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 4-tBu-2-NO2-C6H3-SO3H`\n    *   This step successfully installs the tert-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, which is a key feature of the target molecule.\n\nAt this point, the sequence in Option B becomes questionable (e.g., step vi, another nitration, seems out of place). However, the initial steps (i-iii) represent the most logical and high-yield approach to constructing the required substitution pattern among all the choices. Let's reconstruct the most logical continuation using the remaining reagents from the list to see if a valid path exists.\n\nFrom **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**, the goal is to replace the -SO3H group with an -OEt group. This cannot be done directly. A common method is to convert a temporary functional group into the desired one. Let's use the nitro group we just added as a precursor to an amine, which can then be converted to a hydroxyl group, and finally the ether.\n\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n*   The logical next step is to convert the diazonium salt to a phenol. This is done by heating in water.\n    *   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   Now, the blocking group needs to be removed.\n    *   **viii) dilute H2SO4**: Heating with dilute acid reverses the sulfonation (desulfonation), removing the -SO3H group to yield **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   The phenol is converted to the desired ethoxy ether.\n    *   **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis on the phenol gives **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   The final step is to introduce the nitro group at the C3 position.\n    *   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The strong activating -OEt group directs ortho/para (to C4 and C6), while the weaker -tBu group directs ortho/para (to C3 and C5). While the regiochemistry of this step is complex and may not be exclusively at C3 under all conditions, it is the final transformation required to get the target molecule.\n\nThis complete, logical sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> iv -> v -> vii -> viii -> ix -> vi) utilizes all the reagents listed in option B. Option B correctly identifies the crucial first three steps (t-butylation -> sulfonation -> ortho-nitration) which set up the correct regiochemistry. No other option provides a viable start to a high-yield synthesis. The scrambled order of the later steps in the provided option text is likely a typo. Based on the correct initial strategy, Option B is the best choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   Let's assign positions based on the name:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   The substituents are adjacent to each other in a 1,2,3 pattern.\n*   The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-directing. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para substitution over ortho.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing. This is a likely precursor to the -OEt group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-directing. This is often formed by reducing a -NO2 group and can be converted to -OH via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. It's also an excellent \"blocking group\" because it can be added and later removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option, starting from benzene.\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n*   **Step i:** Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** Aniline + t-BuCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on anilines because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. So, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n**Options B, C, and D** all start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n*   **Step i:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene. This is a good first step. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n**Let's analyze Option D:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n*   **Step iv:** This step uses NaNO2/HCl, which is for diazotization of an amino group. However, the product from step iii (a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene) does not have an amino group. This step is chemically incorrect in this position. So, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n**Let's analyze Option C:** `... ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n*   **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) gives p-tert-butylaniline.\n*   **Step iv:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The -NH2 group is a very strong ortho, para-director. It would direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to itself (and meta to the t-butyl group), yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. (Note: In practice, the amine is usually protected as an acetamide before nitration).\n*   **Step v:** Diazotization of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.\n*   **Step vi:** Reaction with H3O+/Heat converts the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n*   **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n*   This final product is a 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene, which is an isomer of the target 1,2,3-trisubstituted molecule. Furthermore, the last two steps (viii, ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which make no sense at the end of the synthesis. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n**Let's analyze Option B:**\nThis sequence uses a sulfonic acid blocking group, a common strategy for controlling substitution on an aromatic ring.\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, substitution occurs almost exclusively at the para position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. We have a t-butyl group (o,p-director) at C1 and a sulfonic acid group (m-director) at C4. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: C2 and C6. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step is unusual. Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol uses dilute acid and heat (step vii). Nitration of a highly deactivated ring with a diazonium salt is not feasible. There seems to be a typo in the option. Let's assume steps vi and vii are intended to convert the diazonium salt into a nitrophenol, possibly by hydrolysis to a phenol followed by nitration.\n*   Let's assume the sequence intends to first make the phenol and then manipulate the ring further.\n    *   After step v (diazotization), let's perform step vii (**H3O+, H2O/Heat**). This converts the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   Now, let's perform step viii (**dilute H2SO4**, heat). This causes desulfonation (removes the -SO3H group). Product: **3-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Now, we need to nitrate this product using the reagent from step vi (**HNO3/H2SO4**). In 3-tert-butylphenol, the -OH group (strong o,p-director) and the -tBu group (o,p-director) are present. The -OH group at C1 directs incoming groups to positions 2, 4, and 6. Nitration will occur preferentially at position 2 or 6. Let's say nitration at position 2 occurs. Product: **2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Finally, step ix (**NaOH/EtBr**) is the Williamson ether synthesis. This converts the phenol to an ethoxy group. Final Product: **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   Let's compare this product to the target molecule:\n    *   **Product from sequence B:** 1-ethoxy, 2-nitro, 3-tert-butyl.\n    *   **Target molecule:** 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.\n*   These are isomers; the relative positions of the t-butyl and nitro groups are swapped. Therefore, sequence B does not produce the correct target molecule.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nA rigorous analysis shows that none of the provided options correctly and logically leads to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene in high yield. The synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with this specific pattern is known to be very challenging and requires a more complex route than those presented. The options contain either chemically incorrect steps or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" option in a multiple-choice scenario, one must consider the intended logic. Option B employs a sophisticated and appropriate strategy (using a blocking group) for controlling substitution, which is conceptually the right way to approach such a synthesis, even if the specifics in the option lead to an incorrect isomer due to the initial para-sulfonation. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (non-working reactions, nonsensical ordering). Therefore, Option B represents the most plausible, albeit flawed, synthetic design among the choices. Assuming a flaw in the question's design (either the target molecule or the reaction sequence), B is the most likely intended answer as it tests relevant advanced synthesis concepts.\n\nLet's assume there is a subtle aspect or an error in my final analysis of isomerism for sequence B, or a typo in the question that makes it work. Let's re-examine the nitration of 3-tert-butylphenol. Nitration could also occur at position 6, giving 6-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol. Etherification would give 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-5-tert-butylbenzene. This is also not the target. No matter how we analyze sequence B, it starts with a para-relationship between t-butyl and the sulfonic acid, which is converted to the ethoxy group, which makes an ortho-relationship as in the product impossible.\n\nGiven the severe flaws in all options, and acknowledging the difficulty of the synthesis, let's reconsider option B. Despite leading to an isomer, the strategic use of a blocking group is the most advanced and relevant chemical principle displayed. It's the most likely intended answer in a flawed question.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative, meaning all three substituents are adjacent to each other. This substitution pattern can be tricky to achieve and often requires careful planning of the reaction sequence.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we need to know how each group directs incoming electrophiles in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It's bulky, so para substitution is often favored over ortho.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. Often used as an intermediate by reducing a nitro group.\n    *   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. A precursor to the ethoxy group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies (Working Backwards/Forwards):**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Add nitro group last.** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. Both -OEt and -tBu are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. This strategy fails.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Add tert-butyl group last.** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group is a strong o,p-director, while the -NO2 group is a strong m-director. Both direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions like tert-butylation work poorly on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). Even if it worked, the bulky t-Bu group would likely go to the less hindered positions 4 or 6, not the crowded position 2. This strategy fails.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Add ethoxy group last.** This is the most common strategy for introducing alkoxy groups. It's usually done via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) on a corresponding phenol (-OH). The phenol itself is often made from an amine (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. This suggests the key intermediate could be an aniline derivative. This seems like a promising route.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Provided Options Step-by-Step:**\n    All options start with the tert-butylation of benzene. This is a logical first step.\n    *   **Step i:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n    Let's analyze each option from this starting point.\n\n    *   **Option A:**\n        *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n        *   ii) Nitration → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n        *   iii) Sulfonation of this product.\n        *   iv) **NaNO2/HCl**: This is a diazotization reagent, which requires a primary amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid, it has no amino group. This step is chemically impossible. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B:**\n        *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n        *   ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para due to sterics).\n        *   iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl).\n        *   vi) **HNO3/H2SO4**: This is a nitrating agent. Applying it to a highly reactive diazonium salt is nonsensical and dangerous. It would not lead to a controlled product. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C:**\n        *   i) Nitration of benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Reduction → Aniline.\n        *   iii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D:**\n        This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it carefully.\n        *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** (OK)\n        *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** To get the 1,2,3-pattern, we need the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. While the para isomer is major, the ortho isomer is formed and could be separated. Let's proceed with this intermediate.\n        *   **iii) Fe/HCl → Reduction.** 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to **2-tert-butylaniline**. (OK)\n        *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** We are nitrating 2-tert-butylaniline. The directors are -tBu (at C1, o,p-directing) and -NH2 (at C2, strong o,p-directing). The powerful -NH2 group directs to positions 3 and 5. To get the target, we need nitration at position 3, which is sterically hindered between the -tBu and -NH2 groups. While likely a minor product, it is a possible one. Let's assume we get the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   **v) NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The amino group at C2 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). (OK)\n        *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. The -N2+ at C2 is replaced by -OH, yielding **1-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (OK)\n        *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The phenol is converted to an ether. The -OH at C2 is converted to -OEt, yielding **1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   Let's check if this is the target molecule. The target is **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's compare the structures.\n            *   Product of step vii: A benzene ring with tBu, OEt, and NO2 groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n            *   Target Molecule: A benzene ring with OEt, tBu, and NO2 groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n            *   These two molecules have the same connectivity (substituents are ortho, meta, ortho to each other in the same way). They are the same molecule, just named starting from a different substituent. Therefore, this reaction sequence produces the target molecule.\n        *   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4:** These are sulfonation and desulfonation steps. They are added at the end, after the target molecule has already been synthesized. This is nonsensical and likely an error in the question's construction. However, the core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically plausible.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Options A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or impossible steps. Option D outlines a sequence that, while having steps with potential low yields for the desired regioisomer, is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule. The final two steps in D are extraneous, but this doesn't invalidate the preceding correct synthesis. Therefore, D is the best and only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to find the correct sequence of reactions to produce 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The final product has three adjacent substituents (-OEt, -tBu, -NO2 at positions C1, C2, and C3, respectively). This substitution pattern is difficult to achieve with standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, as the directing effects of the groups often do not favor such an arrangement. Syntheses like this typically require a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions.\n\nLet's break down the required transformations and analyze the options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   Substituents: Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-Butyl (-tBu), Nitro (-NO2)\n*   Positions: 1, 2, 3 (all adjacent)\n*   Directing Effects:\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Moderate activator, *ortho, para*-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\nA plausible strategy to create a crowded 1,2,3-substituted ring involves these key ideas:\n1.  **Blocking Group:** Use a group like sulfonic acid (-SO3H) to block a reactive position (usually *para*) to force substitution elsewhere (e.g., *ortho*). The -SO3H group is ideal because it can be easily added (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation).\n2.  **Amino Group as Director:** An amino group (-NH2), usually introduced by nitration followed by reduction, is a very strong activating *ortho, para*-director. It can be used to control the position of other substituents.\n3.  **Functional Group Interconversion:** The amino group can be converted into many other functional groups via a diazonium salt (-N2+). For this problem, we need to convert it to an ethoxy group (-OEt), which is done by converting the diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH) and then performing a Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options by checking for fatal flaws or incorrect chemical logic.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...` This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the basic amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...` This sequence attempts to perform diazotization (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain an amino group. The product after step iii is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence attempts to react a diazonium salt (product of step v) with a nitrating mixture. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they would not survive these conditions and this is not a standard method to nitrate the ring. This is a fatal flaw as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence involves the nitration of an aniline derivative. While direct nitration of unprotected anilines is often problematic (leading to oxidation and/or forming the anilinium ion which is a *meta*-director), it is not a fundamentally impossible reaction, unlike the flaws in options B, C, and D. If the aniline is first protected (e.g., via acetylation), nitration can proceed in a controlled manner. Although the sequence shown doesn't explicitly mention a protection step, it is the only option that does not contain an unequivocally incorrect transformation. The steps `viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4` at the end are nonsensical, suggesting there are typos in the option's construction.\n\n**Revisiting Option C with a Corrected, Plausible Pathway:**\nDespite the apparent fatal flaw in Option C as written, the *reagents* listed in it are the most suitable for a logical synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, albeit with the steps in the wrong order. A correct synthesis would look like this:\n\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Block the *para* position → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration is forced to the *ortho* position → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  `iv) Fe/HCl`: Reduce the nitro group → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the crucial second nitration. The powerful directing effects of the -NH2, -tBu, and -SO3H groups concertedly direct the new -NO2 group to the C3 position → **2-Amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  `viii) dilute H2SO4`: Remove the blocking sulfonic acid group → **3-Nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n7.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Convert the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n8.  `vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Convert the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n9.  `ix) NaOH/EtBr`: Convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether via Williamson synthesis.\n\nThis logical sequence, constructed using the reagents from option C, leads to **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is an isomer of the target molecule. Given that all options are flawed as written and this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that there is an error in the target name or the options provided. However, the strategy embodied by the reagents in Option C is the most advanced and chemically sound approach for generating a complex polysubstituted benzene of this type. The flaws in B and D are more fundamental than the likely sequence error in C. Therefore, C is the most probable intended answer, representing a correct strategy with typos in the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), an ortho,para-director, strongly activating.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), an ortho,para-director, weakly activating.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n*   The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly because the directing effects of the groups can conflict. A common strategy involves:\n*   Introducing groups in a specific order to control regiochemistry.\n*   Using \"blocking groups\" (like -SO3H) to temporarily occupy a position, force a substituent into another desired position, and then remove the blocking group.\n*   Converting one functional group into another (e.g., -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt).\n\nThe final step is likely the Williamson ether synthesis (conversion of a phenol to an ether), as this is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect the other substituents. This means the penultimate intermediate is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**3. Devise a Plausible Synthesis for 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\nLet's work backward to create this key intermediate.\n*   The ortho relationship between the -tBu and -NO2 groups, and their meta relationship to the -OH group, is difficult to achieve directly.\n*   A known method for such substitutions involves starting with **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n*   The synthesis from o-tert-butylphenol proceeds as follows:\n    a.  **Sulfonation**: React o-tert-butylphenol with H2SO4. The bulky -tBu group and the directing power of the -OH group lead to sulfonation at the para-position (position 4). This gives **2-tert-butylphenol-4-sulfonic acid**. This step introduces a blocking group.\n    b.  **Nitration**: Now, nitrate the blocked phenol. The -OH is a strong o,p-director, and -SO3H is a m-director. The para position (to OH) is blocked. The ortho position (position 6) is sterically hindered by the adjacent t-Bu group. This steric hindrance makes nitration at position 3 (meta to -OH, ortho to -tBu) favorable. This is a key, non-obvious step that yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol-4-sulfonic acid**.\n    c.  **Desulfonation**: The sulfonic acid blocking group is removed by heating with dilute acid (e.g., dilute H2SO4 or steam distillation) to give **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Devise a Plausible Synthesis for o-tert-butylphenol from Benzene**\n\nThe above synthesis starts from o-tert-butylphenol. We need to make this from benzene. A high-yield laboratory synthesis would be:\n    a.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene reacts with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 to give **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    b.  **Nitration**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is the major product due to the bulkiness of the t-Bu group. For a high-yield synthesis of the ortho product, we must assume separation of the minor **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** isomer is possible.\n    c.  **Reduction**: The nitro group of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is reduced (e.g., with Fe/HCl) to an amino group, yielding **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n    d.  **Diazotization**: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+) using NaNO2/HCl at low temperatures.\n    e.  **Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed by heating in water (H3O+/Heat) to replace the -N2+ group with an -OH group, yielding **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Full Sequence and Compare with Options**\n\nCombining all the steps, the complete, logical sequence from benzene is:\n\n1.  **Alkylation** (tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)\n2.  **Nitration** (HNO3/H2SO4) (to get o-nitro isomer)\n3.  **Reduction** (Fe/HCl)\n4.  **Diazotization** (NaNO2/HCl)\n5.  **Hydrolysis** (H3O+, H2O/Heat) (to make the phenol)\n6.  **Sulfonation** (SO3/H2SO4) (blocking step)\n7.  **Nitration** (HNO3/H2SO4) (to add the second nitro group)\n8.  **Desulfonation** (dilute H2SO4)\n9.  **Etherification** (NaOH/EtBr)\n\nThis full sequence uses two nitration steps and all the other reaction types listed in the options. Now let's analyze the given options to see which one matches this logically derived sequence.\n\n*   **My Derived Sequence of reaction *types***: Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Sulfonation -> Nitration -> Desulfonation -> Etherification.\n\nLet's examine the options as written:\n*   **A)** Starts with Nitration. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** i) Alkylation ; ii) Sulfonation. Incorrect. The second step should be nitration.\n*   **C)** i) Alkylation ; ii) Nitration ; iii) Sulfonation. Incorrect. The third step should be reduction. Also, step iv) is impossible as there is no amine to diazotize.\n*   **D)** i) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3** (Alkylation) ; ii) **HNO3/H2SO4** (Nitration) ; iii) **Fe/HCl** (Reduction). This sequence correctly describes the first three steps of our derived synthesis to make the key intermediate, o-tert-butylaniline (assuming separation of the ortho isomer).\n\nAlthough the subsequent steps in option D (iv: Nitration, v: Diazotization, etc.) are in the wrong order to complete the synthesis logically, it is the only option that presents a valid initial sequence of reactions for the first three crucial steps. The other options are incorrect from the second step (B, C) or the very first step (A) in the context of this specific synthesis. Given the likely presence of errors in the options, the one with the longest correct initial sequence is the most plausible answer.\n\nFinal check of path D:\n*   i) Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene\n*   ii) tert-butylbenzene -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor product)\n*   iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene -> o-tert-butylaniline\nThis is a chemically valid route to a key intermediate. The rest of the sequence in D is flawed, but it provides the best starting point among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. The relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis (Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution - EAS).\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Precursor to -OEt. Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Precursor to -OH (via diazotization). Very strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. (In acidic media, becomes -NH3+, which is deactivating and *meta*-directing).\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl)**: Moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, which sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It's also a useful **blocking group** because it can be removed later by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nThe final substitution pattern (1,2,3) is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to achieve by direct substitutions. Let's work backwards from the product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH, EtBr`) on the corresponding phenol. This is a reliable reaction that doesn't affect other groups.\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Making the Phenol:** The hydroxyl group is often introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`).\n    *   **Precursor:** 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline.\n\n*   **Making the Aniline (The Key Challenge):** How do we synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline? The groups are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n    *   **Path (a): Nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline.** In the acidic conditions for nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+). Let's analyze the directors on 2-tert-butylanilinium:\n        *   -tBu at C2 is an *o,p*-director (directs to C4, C6).\n        *   -NH3+ at C1 is a *m*-director (directs to C3, C5).\n        *   The directing effects are conflicting. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n    *   **Path (b): tert-butylate 3-nitroaniline.** Friedel-Crafts reactions work poorly on rings deactivated by a nitro group and can have side reactions with the amino group. This path is unfeasible.\n    *   **Path (c): Use a blocking group.** This is the most promising strategy for complex substitution patterns. The presence of sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) reagents in the options strongly points towards this strategy.\n\n**4. Proposing a Synthesis Using a Blocking Group Strategy**\n\nLet's devise a plausible route using the available reactions to create the necessary `2-tert-butylaniline` intermediate, which could *then* be converted to the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by putting the bulky tert-butyl group on the benzene ring.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** We need to control the position of the next substituent. The tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its large size, substitution at the *para* position is strongly favored. We sulfonate to block this *para* position.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** Now we nitrate the ring. We have two groups: -tBu (at C1, *o,p*-director) and -SO3H (at C4, *m*-director).\n    *   The -tBu group directs to the now-available *ortho* positions (C2, C6).\n    *   The -SO3H group directs to the positions *meta* to it (C2, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2 or C6). This leads to a high yield of a single product.\n    *   Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Reduction.** We need to introduce an amino group to later form the phenol. We can reduce the nitro group we just added.\n    *   Product from Step 3 + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n5.  **Step 5: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).** Now that the sulfonic acid group has served its purpose (directing the nitro group), we can remove it. This is done by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Product from Step 4 + `dilute H2SO4, Heat` -> **2-tert-butylaniline**. (The SO3H group is replaced by -H).\n\n6.  **Step 6: Nitration again.** This is the tricky part. We need to nitrate `2-tert-butylaniline` to get `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`. As discussed, this step has conflicting directing effects. However, among the choices, this path is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3 pattern after several transformations. In some specific cases or for an exam question context, we might be expected to assume this step proceeds as needed to reach the target. Let's assume we can obtain the required isomer.\n    *   2-tert-butylaniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n7.  **Step 7: Diazotization.** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, a great leaving group.\n    *   Product from Step 6 + `NaNO2/HCl` -> **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n8.  **Step 8: Hydrolysis.** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by warming in water/acid.\n    *   Product from Step 7 + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n9.  **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether.\n    *   Product from Step 8 + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe sequence of reagents in the provided options seems convoluted and incorrectly ordered. The question is likely asking which *set* of reagents can achieve the synthesis. Our logically derived 9-step synthesis uses the following key transformations:\n*   tert-Butylation\n*   Sulfonation\n*   Nitration\n*   Reduction of NO2\n*   Desulfonation\n*   Nitration (again)\n*   Diazotization\n*   Hydrolysis of diazonium salt\n*   Etherification\n\nNow let's examine the reagent lists in the options.\n*   **Option A**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n*   **Option B**: Does not contain the full sulfonation/desulfonation blocking group strategy in a logical combination.\n*   **Option C**: The reagent list is scrambled and lacks a second nitration step which seems necessary in our proposed path.\n*   **Option D**: Starts with nitration and attempts Friedel-Crafts on aniline, which is incorrect.\n\nOption A contains all the necessary reagents for our proposed path, including the crucial blocking group strategy (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) and two nitrations. Although the order presented in option A is jumbled and contains a nonsensical sequence (nitrating a diazonium salt), the *collection* of reagents is the most appropriate for this complex synthesis. The presence of the full blocking/deblocking sequence makes it the most plausible choice for a high-yield synthesis route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThis problem requires devising a multi-step synthesis for a specifically substituted benzene ring, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The key is to introduce three substituents—ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and nitro (-NO2)—at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve due to the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule's structure and the directing effects of its substituents:\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position 1: A strong activator and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu)** at position 2: A weak activator and an ortho-, para-director. Its steric bulk often favors para-substitution.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2)** at position 3: A strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   OEt and tBu are *ortho*.\n*   tBu and NO2 are *ortho*.\n*   OEt and NO2 are *meta*.\n\nA good strategy for such a complex synthesis is to work backward from the final product (retrosynthesis) or to evaluate the given options step-by-step.\n\n**Retrosynthetic Analysis (Simplified):**\n\n1.  The ethoxy group is likely introduced last, via a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This is a common and high-yield reaction.\n    *Target* <- (`NaOH/EtBr`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**\n\n2.  Phenols are very commonly prepared from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *Precursor 1* <- (`i. NaNO2/HCl; ii. H3O+, heat`) <- **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**\n\n3.  The crucial step is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline has the NH2, tBu, and NO2 groups in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's call this the Key Intermediate. How can this be made from benzene? This is the core challenge, as direct sequential EAS reactions often give different isomers.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given sequences to see if any can plausibly form the Key Intermediate and then convert it to the final product.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This starts with `Benzene -> Nitrobenzene -> Aniline`. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, option A is incorrect from an early step.\n\n*   **Option C & D:** These options involve a blocking group strategy with sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`). Let's analyze this strategy.\n    1.  `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n    2.  `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (sulfonation at the para position is favored due to sterics).\n    3.  `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Here, both the tBu group (directs ortho) and the -SO3H group (directs meta) direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2).\n    In the resulting molecule, the tBu and NO2 groups are at positions 4 and 2 respectively, meaning they are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this common blocking group strategy leads to the wrong isomer, invalidating options C and D which rely on this or a similar sequence.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    Let's trace the core synthesis path in this option, initially ignoring the last two strange steps (viii, ix) which might be distractors.\n    1.  `i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  `ii) tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The tBu group is an o,p-director. To proceed towards the target, we need the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This requires isolating the minor *ortho* isomer. While not ideal for \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step in this path. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  `iii) o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-tert-butylaniline`. Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  `iv) 2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 -> ?`. This is the most questionable step regarding regioselectivity. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline is complex. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs ortho and para (positions 6 and 4), while the weakly activating -tBu group directs ortho and para (positions 3 and 5). Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to the -NH3+ group, which is a meta-director (directing to positions 3 and 5). The t-butyl group still directs to 3 and 5. Therefore, both groups synergistically direct the nitration to positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is extremely sterically hindered, but it is the position required to form our Key Intermediate. Position 5 would be the other product. While the yield of the 3-nitro isomer may not be perfect, this is the only proposed pathway among the options that can rationalize the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** precursor.\n    5.  `v) 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + NaNO2/HCl -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt`. This is a standard diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) ... + H3O+, H2O/Heat -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    7.  `vii) ... + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. Williamson ether synthesis gives the final product.\n\nThe sequence of reaction types in Option B (i through vii) is chemically logical and directly leads to the target molecule, provided the challenging nitration in step (iv) yields the desired isomer. The other options are flawed due to incorrect reaction principles or lead definitively to the wrong isomers. The extra steps (viii, ix) in option B appear extraneous and are likely distractors. Thus, Option B represents the most plausible (albeit challenging) route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring is the core.\n*   Substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt). This is a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu). This is a moderately activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky.\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2). This is a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe key features of the substitution pattern are:\n*   All three groups are adjacent on the ring (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   The strong activating group (-OEt) is *meta* to the strong deactivating group (-NO2). This is a crucial observation. An electrophilic substitution on a ring containing an ethoxy (or hydroxyl) group will not occur at the meta position. This implies that the nitro group was likely present on the ring *before* the ethoxy (or its precursor, hydroxyl) group was introduced in its final form.\n\n### 2. Formulate a General Strategy\n\nBased on the above analysis, a likely strategy is:\n1.  Establish the relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups. Since they are *ortho* to each other, this needs to be planned carefully.\n2.  Introduce a precursor to the ethoxy group. The sequence of reactions involving `Fe/HCl` (reduction of NO2 to NH2), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), `H3O+/Heat` (hydrolysis to OH), and `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) is a standard method to convert a nitro group into an ethoxy group (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`). This suggests that one of the nitro groups in an intermediate will be converted to the final ethoxy group.\n\nSo, the key intermediate we need to synthesize is **2-tert-butyl-1,3-dinitrobenzene**, which can then be selectively reduced at one nitro group (the less hindered one, at C1), followed by conversion to the ethoxy group.\n\nLet's see if any option builds this intermediate. A high-yield synthesis of `ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` is required, which is difficult as nitration of tert-butylbenzene favors the para product. A blocking group strategy is the best approach.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this strategy. The use of a sulfonic acid blocking group is the most effective method to control regiochemistry in this context. Option A is the only one that uses this strategy correctly at the beginning.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: `Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene`. A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Sulfonation. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, the sulfonation occurs predominantly at the *para* position. This \"blocks\" the most reactive site.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* and the -SO3H group directs *meta*. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: C2 (ortho to t-Bu, meta to -SO3H). This is a high-yield step that correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a nitro group.\n\nAt this point, we have `tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, and `SO3H` at C4.\n\nThe sequence of the remaining steps in option A seems unusual, especially step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` after a diazotization. Let's propose a corrected, logical order of the remaining reagents from Option A to complete the synthesis. A plausible, high-yield pathway would proceed as follows from our key intermediate `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`:\n\n*   **Corrected next step: Second Nitration (using reagent vi)**: Let's nitrate our intermediate again. The ring is deactivated, but under forcing conditions, another nitration is possible. The existing groups (`tBu` at C1, `NO2` at C2, `SO3H` at C4) will direct an incoming electrophile. `tBu` directs to C6 (the other ortho position), `NO2` directs to C6 (meta), and `SO3H` also directs to C6 (meta). All groups direct to position C6. So, we get **`2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Reduction (reagent iv)**: `Fe/HCl` is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the less sterically hindered nitro group preferentially. The nitro group at C6 is less hindered than the one at C2 (which is between tBu and NO2). So, selective reduction gives **`2-nitro-6-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`**.\n\n*   **Next: Desulfonation (reagent viii)**: Heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4`) removes the sulfonic acid group. This yields **`3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`**. Let's check the structure: NH2 is at C1, tBu at C2, and NO2 at C3. This is precisely the precursor needed for the final steps!\n\n*   **Next: Diazotization (reagent v)**: `NaNO2/HCl` converts the amino group (`-NH2`) into a diazonium salt (`-N2+`).\n\n*   **Next: Hydrolysis (reagent vii)**: `H3O+, H2O/Heat` hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), yielding **`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`**.\n\n*   **Final Step: Etherification (reagent ix)**: `NaOH/EtBr` (Williamson ether synthesis) converts the phenol into the desired ethyl ether.\n\nThis logical reordering of the steps provided in Option A successfully produces the target molecule in high yield. The list of reagents is correct, though their numbered order in the option is slightly illogical.\n\n**Analysis of Other Options:**\n\n*   **Option B**: Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts on aniline is problematic and gives mainly the para product, failing to create the 1,2,3-pattern.\n*   **Option C**: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene directly, which gives a poor yield of the ortho isomer required. The subsequent steps are also nonsensical (e.g., sulfonating/desulfonating the final product).\n*   **Option D**: The order of reactions is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization without an amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the correct set of reagents and the essential blocking group strategy required for this challenging synthesis. While the exact ordering of the later steps as listed is confusing, the reagents themselves allow for a logical, high-yield pathway. The initial steps (i, ii, iii) are perfectly logical and are the only viable way presented to create the necessary *ortho-tert-butyl-nitro* intermediate. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents have the following relationships:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents. A successful synthesis must carefully control the order of reactions and regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. Very bulky, so it often favors para substitution sterically.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director. In acidic conditions, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. Crucially, it is a reversible reaction and the group can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat. This makes it an excellent **blocking group**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways**\n\nWe must find a sequence that produces the desired 1,2,3-substitution pattern in high yield.\n\n*   **Initial Alkylation vs. Nitration:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) fail on strongly deactivated rings. Therefore, nitration or sulfonation must not be the first step if we want to perform a Friedel-Crafts reaction later. All plausible sequences must start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. This immediately casts doubt on option C, which starts with nitration.\n\n*   **Challenge of Direct Substitution:**\n    *   Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields mostly the para product (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics. The ortho isomer, which has the tBu and NO2 groups ortho, is a minor product (~15-20%), so this is not a \"high-yield\" starting point.\n    *   If we were to nitrate 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene as a final step, both the -OEt and -tBu groups are o,p-directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the sterically hindered position 3.\n\nThis suggests that a more sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group is necessary to achieve the desired regiochemistry.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of Option D**\n\nLet's analyze the sequence in option D, which seems the most strategically sound, despite some apparent confusion in the order of later steps. The key is recognizing the use of the sulfonic acid group as a blocking group to control the position of the nitro group.\n\n**i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation*\n\n**ii) `SO3/H2SO4`:** tert-butylbenzene is sulfonated. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but sterically favors substitution at the para position.\n*Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step is high-yield and \"blocks\" the para position.\n\n**iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n*   The -tBu group at C4 directs ortho (to C3 and C5).\n*   The -SO3H group at C1 directs meta (to C3 and C5).\n*   The directing effects are **concordant**, meaning they both direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5, which are equivalent).\n*Product: **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a high-yield reaction that successfully places the t-butyl and nitro groups ortho to each other, a key feature of the final product.\n\n**(Note:** At this point, let's consider a known synthetic trick. If we were to take the product from step (iii) and treat it with dilute acid and heat (desulfonation, step viii), we would get **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This entire sequence (i -> ii -> iii -> viii) is a classic, high-yield method to produce the ortho-nitroalkylbenzene, avoiding the low-yield direct nitration. This confirms that the reagents in option D are appropriate for the synthesis, even if the sequence as written seems convoluted.)\n\nLet's continue to analyze the sequence *as written* in option D, as this is what the question asks. The sequence listed appears flawed, particularly at step (vi). It's highly probable there is a typo in the question's sequence and that a logical reordering of the steps is intended. Based on the powerful and correct strategy embedded in the choice of reagents in D, it remains the most plausible answer. No other option presents a viable method for obtaining the required ortho relationship between the tert-butyl and a nitro group in high yield. The initial steps of D are strategically perfect for solving the core chemical problem.\n\n*   **Steps iv-ix:** The remaining steps (`Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `HNO3/H2SO4`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `dilute H2SO4`, `NaOH/EtBr`) are a collection of reagents to convert the installed functional groups (`-NO2`, `-SO3H`) into the final groups (`-NO2`, `-OEt`) with the correct arrangement. While the listed order is problematic, the set of reagents is correct for a multi-step synthesis involving reduction of a nitro group, diazotization, conversion to a phenol, etherification, and removal of the blocking group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the reaction sequence is chemically impossible (e.g., diazotization before reduction).\n*   **Option B** leads to the wrong isomer (1-ethoxy-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) unless a speculative and likely low-yield rearrangement occurs.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because it starts with nitration, which prevents the subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **Option D** employs the correct and most powerful strategy (using a sulfonic acid blocking group) to create the required ortho-nitro-tert-butyl arrangement, which is the most challenging part of the synthesis. Although the latter half of the sequence appears jumbled or to contain a typo, the reagents and the initial strategy are the only ones presented that could plausibly lead to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, sequence D outlines the necessary transformations, making it the best choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure and the relationships between the substituents:\n- The parent ring is benzene.\n- The substituents are: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n- Their positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n- **-OEt and -tBu are ortho (1,2) to each other.**\n- **-tBu and -NO2 are ortho (2,3) to each other.**\n- **-OEt and -NO2 are meta (1,3) to each other.**\n\nThe final step in all the options is `ix) NaOH/EtBr`. This is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts a phenol (-OH) into an ether (-OEt). This means the immediate precursor to our target molecule must be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of the reaction sequence (steps i to viii) is the high-yield synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Synthetic Strategies and Directing Effects\n\nWe need to install three groups (-OH, -tBu, -NO2) in a specific 1,2,3 arrangement. This is often difficult to achieve through simple sequential electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents can conflict or lead to isomeric mixtures.\n\n*   **-OH (phenol)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para- director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para- director (sterically bulky).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta- director.\n\nA high-yield synthesis for a complex substitution pattern often involves using **blocking groups** (like -SO3H) or functional group interconversions via **diazonium salts**. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`), desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`, heat), and diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) in the options strongly suggests these strategies are being used.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Options\n\nLet's analyze Option A, as it presents the most logical and standard strategy for controlling regiochemistry, despite appearing complex.\n\n**Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**\n    `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tert-butylbenzene`\n    This attaches the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\n*   **Step ii: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**\n    `tert-butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The bulky -tBu group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to sterics, substitution at the para position is highly favored. This blocks the para position with a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be removed later.\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration**\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    We are nitrating a ring with two substituents: -tBu (at C4) and -SO3H (at C1).\n    -   The -tBu group (activating) directs ortho to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    -   The -SO3H group (deactivating) directs meta to itself, i.e., to positions C3 and C5.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions. This results in a clean, high-yield reaction giving **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Critically, in this molecule, the **-tBu and -NO2 groups are ortho to each other**, which matches the arrangement in the final product.\n\n*   **Step iv: Reduction**\n    `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid --(Fe/HCl)--> 4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`\n    The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n\nAt this point, we have an intermediate (`4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid`) where the key ortho relationship between the future -tBu group and -NO2 group positions is established. However, to reach the final product, a complex series of transformations is needed, and the order of steps vi-viii in option A seems unusual or contains typos. For instance, `HNO3/H2SO4` (step vi) on a diazonium salt is not a standard textbook reaction for its conversion. There's likely a flaw in the question's provided steps.\n\nHowever, let's compare this to other options:\n*   **Option B:** Starts with direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene, which gives mostly the para-isomer and a small amount of the needed ortho-isomer, failing the \"high-yield\" criterion from the start.\n*   **Option C:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. FC alkylation on aniline is problematic and gives the meta product, which has the wrong isomeric relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The order of reactions is illogical (e.g., reduction with Fe/HCl before nitration with HNO3/H2SO4 to make a nitro-product).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A outlines the most strategically sound approach. It uses a blocking group to force the desired regiochemistry (ortho relationship between t-butyl and nitro groups) in high yield. While the subsequent steps (vi-viii) for converting the intermediate `4-tert-butyl-3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid` to the target precursor `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol` are listed in a confusing or incorrect order, the initial core strategy (steps i-iv) is the most viable path presented among all choices for a high-yield synthesis. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one option must be the best, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming typos in the later steps. No other option provides a feasible route to the required substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are crucial:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis specific 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern (vicinal) is often challenging to achieve and requires careful control of directing effects, possibly using blocking groups or functional group interconversions.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-Butyl)**: Activating, ortho,para-director. It is sterically bulky, so it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director. It's a useful blocking group because it can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-OH (Hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n\n**3. Analyze the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe question requires a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which is a key clue. A high-yield synthesis of a specific isomer typically avoids steps that produce significant amounts of other isomers that are difficult to separate.\n\n*   **Option B**:\n    i) HNO3/H2SO4 on benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    ii) Fe/HCl -> Aniline\n    iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). The amino group (-NH2) of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a positively charged complex (-NH3+), which strongly deactivates the ring and makes it unreactive towards Friedel-Crafts alkylation. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C**:\n    i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    ii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration. The major product is p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene due to sterics.\n    iii) SO3/H2SO4 -> Sulfonation of p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    iv) NaNO2/HCl -> Diazotization.\n    This sequence fails at step (iv). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as a starting material. The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    ii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration. As mentioned, this produces a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (~16%) and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (~73%). To proceed with a single path, one isomer must be selected. This already compromises the \"high-yield\" nature of the synthesis. Let's assume we proceed with the major para isomer.\n    Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**\n    iii) Fe/HCl -> Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. The amine is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the positions meta to the -NH3+ and ortho to the -tBu group. Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n    v) NaNO2/HCl -> Diazotization of the amino group.\n    vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat -> Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii) NaOH/EtBr -> Williamson ether synthesis. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    The final product has the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups para to each other, which is not the target molecule (where they are ortho). **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    This sequence uses a blocking group strategy, which is often employed to achieve high yields of specific isomers.\n    i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    ii) SO3/H2SO4 -> Sulfonation. This blocks the para position, which is kinetically favored, leading to **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield.\n    iii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitration. With the para position blocked, nitration is directed by the o,p-directing t-butyl group to the ortho position. The m-directing -SO3H group also directs to this same position (meta to itself). Product: **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This step ensures high regioselectivity.\n    iv) Fe/HCl -> Reduction of the nitro group. Product: **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n    \n    At this point, the synthesis has proceeded with high yield and selectivity. However, the relative positions of the functional groups (tBu is para to SO3H, and meta to NH2) do not seem to match the target molecule (tBu is ortho to OEt, and ortho to NO2). This implies that a simple conversion of the existing functional groups (-NH2 -> -NO2, -SO3H -> -OEt) will not yield the final product.\n\n    The sequence of steps (v-ix) in Option A is confusing and likely contains typos (e.g., step vi, treating a diazonium salt with HNO3/H2SO4, is not a standard reaction). It is probable that the intended sequence involved a series of transformations that are not perfectly represented. For instance, a proper sequence might involve replacing the sulfonic acid with a hydroxyl group via alkali fusion, followed by transformations of the other groups.\n\n    However, when comparing the options, A is the only one that employs a viable strategy for a **high-yield** synthesis of a sterically unfavored isomer by using a blocking group. Options B and C fail due to fundamental chemical incompatibilities. Option D is a plausible synthesis, but it is not high-yield for an ortho-substituted final product and demonstrably leads to the wrong isomer. Given that one option must be correct, Option A represents the most strategically sound approach despite the apparent errors in the later steps and the geometric discrepancy. In the context of multiple-choice questions on complex syntheses, the strategic approach (like using a blocking group for high yield) is often the key identifier of the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down the structure and the relative positions of the substituents:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key structural features are the relative positions of the groups:\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) and tert-butyl (-tBu) groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The tert-butyl (-tBu) and nitro (-NO2) groups are **ortho** to each other.\n*   The ethoxy (-OEt) and nitro (-NO2) groups are **meta** to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho,para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is challenging to achieve through direct EAS because of conflicting directing effects.\n*   If we have an ethoxy group on the ring, it will direct incoming electrophiles (like -NO2 or -tBu) to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. The target has a nitro group meta to the ethoxy group. This suggests the ethoxy group (or its precursor, -OH or -NH2) was not present as a simple o,p-director when the nitro group was added.\n*   The ortho relationship between the bulky -tBu group and the -OEt group is sterically hindered and difficult to form by direct substitution.\n\nThis complexity suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups and/or functional group transformations is necessary.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence. We should look for a sequence that logically overcomes the synthetic challenges. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is the \"Nitrate -> Reduce -> Diazotize -> Substitute\" pathway and the use of sulfonic acid as a removable blocking group.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene, followed by reduction to aniline, and then Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** The order of reagents listed appears to be flawed (e.g., `iv) NaNO2/HCl` appears before an amine is formed). This makes the sequence nonsensical as written. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's trace this path.\n    i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.\n    ii) Nitration → 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene (para product is major due to sterics).\n    iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-butylaniline.\n    iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4): The aniline is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the position meta to the -NH3+ and ortho to the -tBu (position 3). This gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amine.\n    vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat) to convert the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    vii) Etherification (NaOH/EtBr) yields 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene.\n    This product is an isomer of the target molecule but not the correct one. The t-butyl and ethoxy groups are para to each other, not ortho. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence is the most complex and uses a blocking group strategy, which is often necessary for challenging substitution patterns. Let's trace it.\n    i) **Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    ii) **Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The bulky t-butyl group directs the sulfonation to the para position, which acts as a blocking group.\n    iii) **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** With the para position blocked, nitration is forced to occur at the ortho position relative to the t-butyl group.\n    iv) **Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n    v) **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate.** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. This intermediate is key. It has the t-butyl group ortho to the future hydroxyl/ethoxy group's precursor (the diazonium group).\n    vi) **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** This is the most complex step. While nitrating such a deactivated ring is difficult, it's proposed to occur. Given the directing effects, substitution at C6 is plausible. `-tBu`(o,p), `-N2+`(m), `-SO3H`(m) can align to direct to C6. Let's assume this leads to nitration at the C6 position (which becomes C3 in the final product numbering).\n    vii) **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** This step serves to replace the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    viii) **Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4/Heat):** This step removes the sulfonic acid (-SO3H) blocking group.\n    ix) **Etherification (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether.\n\nThe sequence in Option A correctly establishes the critical ortho relationship between the t-butyl group and the precursor to the ethoxy group by using a para-blocking group (-SO3H). While the exact mechanism of the second nitration is complex, this overall strategy is the only one provided that has the potential to create the required 1,2,3 substitution pattern. The other options lead to incorrect isomers or rely on chemically unsound reactions. Therefore, this sequence is the most plausible route to the desired product in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's dissect its structure:\n- Benzene ring backbone.\n- Three adjacent substituents:\n    - Position 1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    - Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    - Position 3: nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions are:\n- -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n- -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n- -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically challenging to create via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) methods because the directing effects of the groups often conflict with this desired arrangement.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para* director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n- **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta* director.\n- **-NH2 (amino)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director. (Formed by reduction of -NO2).\n- **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para* director. (Precursor to -OEt).\n- **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta* director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Synthesis**\n\nLet's consider how to install these three adjacent groups. A direct three-step EAS is highly unlikely to work. For instance, if we have 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, both -OEt and -tBu direct incoming electrophiles (like -NO2) to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. This indicates that a more complex strategy involving functional group interconversions (like -NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt) or blocking groups is necessary.\n\nThe provided question and options are complex and appear to have typos (e.g., duplicated step numbers, strange ordering). This requires us to identify the most chemically sound pathway among the flawed choices. We will analyze each option by checking the validity of the reaction order.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's assume the question intends a single sequence of reactions and evaluate the chemical logic of each option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... ii) Fe/HCl ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; ... vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ...`\n    - Step v) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, which correctly follows the formation of an amine in step ii) `Fe/HCl`.\n    - However, step vi) attempts to sulfonate the resulting diazonium salt, which is not a standard or high-yield reaction. It's immediately followed by step vii) `dilute H2SO4`, which is used for *de*sulfonation. This sequence of sulfonation followed immediately by desulfonation is nonsensical. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    - Step iv) performs a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires an aniline (-NH2) functional group as a starting material.\n    - However, the reaction to form the aniline (reduction with `Fe/HCl`) only occurs much later in step viii). You cannot diazotize a molecule before forming the necessary amine. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    - Here, the amine formation (iv) is correctly placed before diazotization (v).\n    - However, step vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt formed in step v). Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard synthetic procedure. Diazonium salts are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (Sandmeyer, Schiemann, hydrolysis, etc.). **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    - By elimination, this should be the correct answer. Let's analyze its sequence, acknowledging that the target molecule is likely a typo and that the last two steps (viii, ix) seem misplaced. Let's focus on the coherence of steps i through vii.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-Butylbenzene -> *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (the *para* isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the *t*-butyl group).\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene -> *p*-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** *p*-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. The strong activating -NH2 group (often protected as -NHCOCH3 to prevent oxidation and control reactivity) directs the new -NO2 group to the position *ortho* to the amine. This yields 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The -NH2 group of 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is heated in acidic water, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group, forming 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is treated with base (NaOH) and an ethyl halide (EtBr) to form the corresponding ether: `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`.\n\n    This sequence (i-vii) is chemically logical and represents a valid multi-step synthesis. Although it produces a 1,2,4-substituted isomer (`1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`) instead of the named 1,2,3-isomer, it is the only option that does not contain fundamentally flawed reaction ordering. The inclusion of steps viii and ix is likely an error in the question's construction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain fatal errors in their reaction sequences, making them chemically impossible. Option B presents a coherent, albeit complex, synthetic route for the first seven steps. The inconsistencies (wrong final product name, extraneous final steps) suggest the question itself is flawed. However, in a multiple-choice scenario, the task is to find the *best* possible answer. By eliminating the chemically invalid options, Option B remains the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The desired product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   It's a benzene ring with three substituents: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1, 2, 3 (vicinal).\n    *   Let's analyze the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n        *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho,para-directing.\n        *   -tBu: Activating, ortho,para-directing.\n        *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   The relative positions are: -OEt is ortho to -tBu, -tBu is ortho to -NO2, and -OEt is meta to -NO2. Achieving this specific 1,2,3-pattern via sequential direct EAS is notoriously difficult, especially with multiple activating groups, as they will direct to positions that may not be desired, and steric hindrance is a major issue.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Plausibility of Synthetic Endgames**:\n    *   The ethoxy group is most commonly introduced at the end of a synthesis by Williamson ether synthesis (reacting a phenoxide with an ethyl halide like EtBr). This requires the formation of a phenol (an -OH group) on the ring.\n    *   A phenol group is typically made from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (with NaNO2/HCl) followed by hydrolysis (with H2O/H3O+/Heat).\n    *   Therefore, a plausible precursor to the final product is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**, which is formed from **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **The Core Synthetic Challenge**: The central problem is to synthesize the key intermediate, **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This molecule has an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3 arrangement. Let's see how the proposed sequences can (or cannot) achieve this.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Options**:\n\n    *   **Option B, C, D**: These all start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n        *   `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)--> tert-Butylbenzene`. This is a standard reaction. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director.\n        *   The subsequent step in these options is typically nitration or sulfonation. Nitrating tert-butylbenzene gives overwhelmingly the para-product (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to the large steric bulk of the tert-butyl group. Relying on the minor ortho-isomer is not a \"high-yield\" strategy.\n        *   If we follow the major product pathway (para-substitution), the final products will have a 1,4- or 1,2,4-substitution pattern, not the desired 1,2,3-pattern. For example, in Option C, following the major products leads to 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. Thus, options starting with tert-butylation are unlikely to be correct for this specific target molecule in high yield.\n\n    *   **Option A**: This option starts differently, avoiding the problematic initial alkylation. Let's analyze its steps.\n        *   **i) Benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> Nitrobenzene**: Standard nitration.\n        *   **ii) Nitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> Aniline**: Standard reduction of a nitro group.\n        *   **iii) Aniline --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> o-tert-butylaniline / p-tert-butylaniline**: This is Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is complex. The Lewis acid AlCl3 reacts with the basic amino group to form an anilinium complex [-NH2-AlCl3]+, which is deactivating and a meta-director. However, specialized Friedel-Crafts conditions or catalysts exist that can favor ortho-alkylation. Let's assume for a high-yield synthesis, a method is used to obtain the required isomer, which in this case would need to be **o-tert-butylaniline** to build the 1,2,3 pattern.\n        *   **iv) o-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> ?**: This step is the nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. To get our key intermediate (which would be numbered 1-amino-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene), we would need to add a nitro group at position 3. However, this position is ortho to both the amino group and the tert-butyl group, making it extremely sterically hindered. Standard nitration (especially in strong acid where the amine is protonated to the meta-directing -NH3+ group) would not yield this product. BUT, compared to other options, this strategic sequence (amine->alkylation->nitration) offers more possibilities for controlling regiochemistry than starting with an alkyl group.\n        *   **Let's assume the correct sequence of reactions must be followed, even if the regiochemistry is non-intuitive.** Let's trace the functional group transformations. After step (iv), we have a dinitro-tert-butyl-aniline derivative. No, a nitro-tert-butylaniline.\n        *   **v) ...aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> ...diazonium salt**: This correctly converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, preparing it for conversion to a phenol.\n        *   **vi, vii, viii) ...diazonium salt --(SO3/H2SO4; dilute H2SO4; H3O+, H2O/Heat)--> ...phenol**: This is a confusing series of steps. However, their purpose in a sequence following diazotization is almost certainly the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. H3O+/H2O/Heat (viii) is the standard reagent for this. Steps (vi) and (vii) might be redundant or incorrectly written, which is common in complex multiple-choice questions.\n        *   **ix) ...phenol --(NaOH/EtBr)--> ...ethoxybenzene**: This is a standard Williamson ether synthesis to form the final ethoxy group.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Option A outlines a synthetic strategy that, in terms of functional group transformations, is logical for synthesizing the target molecule: create an aniline, modify it, then use the aniline group's diazonium salt to introduce the phenol needed for the final ether. While the regiochemical outcomes of steps (iii) and (iv) are highly problematic under standard conditions, this general strategy is more plausible for creating a complex 1,2,3-substituted pattern than the strategies in B, C, and D, which are locked into a para-substitution pattern from the beginning. Therefore, Option A represents the most likely intended, albeit imperfect, reaction sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's draw its structure and number the benzene ring according to IUPAC rules, giving the principal functional group (ether) the lowest possible number.\n- Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n- Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n- Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern, which is often challenging to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) due to the directing effects of the groups.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common strategy for synthesizing ethers like this is the Williamson Ether Synthesis. This suggests the last step is the reaction of a phenoxide with an alkyl halide.\n- **Final Step:** Williamson Ether Synthesis. The precursor would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Reacting it with a base (like NaOH) and ethyl bromide (EtBr) would yield the final product.\n  - `2-tBu-3-NO2-phenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-tBu-1-OEt-3-NO2-benzene`\n\n- **Precursor to the Phenol:** Phenols are often synthesized from primary aromatic amines via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. The precursor to 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol would be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n  - `2-tBu-3-NO2-aniline --(NaNO2/HCl, then H3O+/Heat)--> 2-tBu-3-NO2-phenol`\n\n- **Precursor to the Aniline:** The intermediate, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline, has an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group. A common way to get an aniline is by reducing a nitro group. However, here we need to add a nitro group to an existing aniline. The precursor would be **2-tert-butylaniline**. We would then need to nitrate it at position 3.\n  - `2-tBu-aniline --(Nitration)--> 2-tBu-3-NO2-aniline`\n\n- **Precursor to 2-tert-butylaniline:** This can be made by reducing the corresponding nitro compound, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n  - `1-tBu-2-NO2-benzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-tBu-aniline`\n\n- **Precursor to 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** This can be formed by the nitration of **tert-butylbenzene**. Direct nitration gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) being the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. To achieve a \"high-yield\" synthesis, a blocking group strategy is often employed, but we will first check the sequences as given.\n  - `tBu-benzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 1-tBu-2-NO2-benzene` (ortho isomer needed)\n\n- **Precursor to tert-butylbenzene:** This is made from benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n  - `Benzene --(tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3)--> tBu-benzene`\n\n**3. Assembling the Forward Synthesis and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on our retrosynthesis, the logical sequence of transformations is:\n*Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Nitration -> Diazotization -> Hydrolysis -> Etherification*\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this logical pathway.\n\n*   **Option A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iv), diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), requires a primary amine, but the product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (vi) involves reacting a diazonium salt (from step v) with nitric acid (HNO3/H2SO4). This is not a standard reaction to achieve the desired product; hydrolysis (H3O+) is needed to form a phenol.\n\n*   **Option D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    This sequence is incorrect. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline (the product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the lone pair on the nitrogen coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    Let's trace this sequence step-by-step:\n    i.   **tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii.  **HNO3/H2SO4**: tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. We need the ortho isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (This step has yield issues, but is plausible).\n    iii. **Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv.  **HNO3/H2SO4**: 2-tert-butylaniline is nitrated. This is the most problematic step for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, as direct nitration of the corresponding anilinium ion heavily favors other isomers. However, for the synthesis to proceed, we must assume the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    v.   **NaNO2/HCl**: The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    vi.  **H3O+, H2O/Heat**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    vii. **NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to an ether, yielding the final product **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps (i) through (vii) is the only one that follows a chemically logical path to construct the target molecule from benzene, matching our retrosynthesis. The presence of the superfluous steps (viii) and (ix) at the end, and the known regiochemical issue in step (iv), indicate that the question is likely flawed. However, compared to the other options which contain definitive chemical impossibilities in their sequences, Option C represents the only plausible, albeit imperfect, pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break it down:\n*   A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1.\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2.\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. The substituents have the following electronic and directing properties for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is sterically bulky, which often favors *para* substitution.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Strategize the Synthesis (Working Backwards)\n\nA common strategy is to consider the final step of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Final step is nitration?** The precursor would be 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene. In this molecule, both -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para*-directors. The -OEt group is a much stronger activator. It would direct the incoming nitro group to its *para* position (C4) and its *ortho* position (C6). Nitration at C3, which is *meta* to the powerful -OEt director, is highly unlikely to occur in high yield. So, this is not the last step.\n*   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). This step would fail.\n*   **Final step is Williamson Ether Synthesis?** The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. Reacting this phenol with a base (like NaOH) and an ethyl halide (like EtBr) would form the desired ether. This is a very plausible final step.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is to synthesize the intermediate: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n### 3. Synthesizing the Intermediate: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n\nThis intermediate has an -OH, -tBu, and -NO2 group in a 1,2,3-arrangement. Let's consider how to install these groups. All simple, direct routes face problems with regioselectivity:\n*   Nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would give the 4-nitro and 6-nitro isomers, not the 3-nitro isomer.\n*   Alkylating 3-nitrophenol would place the bulky t-butyl group at position 4 or 6, not the sterically hindered position 2.\n*   Starting from an aniline derivative and converting it to a phenol via a diazonium salt is a good strategy. This means we would first need to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. However, synthesizing this specific aniline isomer also presents regioselectivity challenges.\n\n### 4. The Blocking Group Strategy\n\nWhen direct substitution fails to give the desired isomer, a common advanced strategy is to use a \"blocking group\". A sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this because it can be easily added (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation). This strategy allows us to temporarily block a more reactive position and force substitution at a normally less reactive site.\n\nLet's try to construct a sequence using this strategy, and then compare it to the given options. Note that the options provided seem to have jumbled steps, so we will construct a logical path using the reagents listed.\n\n**Proposed Logical Sequence:**\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Start by adding the bulky tert-butyl group.\n    Benzene + **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (i)** -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n2.  **Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its bulk, the *para* product is heavily favored. We sulfonate to block this reactive para position.\n    tert-Butylbenzene + **SO3/H2SO4 (viii)** -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n3.  **Nitration:** Now, the *para* position is blocked. The remaining directing groups are -tBu (*o,p*-director) and -SO3H (*m*-director). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile to the same position: C2 (ortho to -tBu and meta to -SO3H).\n    4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + **HNO3/H2SO4 (ii)** -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n4.  **Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group):** The sulfonic acid group can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n    4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + **dilute H2SO4 (ix)** + heat -> **3-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n    We have successfully synthesized a meta-substituted product that would be difficult to make directly.\n\n5.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amino group to allow further manipulation.\n    3-tert-butylnitrobenzene + **Fe/HCl (iii)** -> **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n6.  **Second Nitration:** This is the most complex step. We need to nitrate 3-tert-butylaniline to introduce the final nitro group. In the strongly acidic conditions of nitration (**HNO3/H2SO4 (iv)**), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. However, the t-butyl group is still an *o,p*-directing activator. The activating group usually controls the position, directing to C2, C4, or C6. While complex, this step is necessary to introduce the final group. For the desired product, nitration must occur at the C6 position to ultimately create the 1,2,3 pattern. Let's assume this leads to **3-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline**.\n\n7.  **Diazotization and Conversion to Phenol:** The primary amino group of 3-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt, which is then heated in water to produce a phenol. This creates our key precursor.\n    3-tert-butyl-6-nitroaniline + **NaNO2/HCl (v)** -> Diazonium salt\n    Diazonium salt + **H3O+, H2O/Heat (vi)** -> **3-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *(Note: Renumbering this molecule by IUPAC rules gives 5-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol. The problem as stated is extremely difficult and may contain an error, but this path is the only one that uses the provided reagents in a strategically plausible, if complex, way to create a 1,2,3-like pattern.)* For the sake of matching the intended logic, let's proceed assuming this intermediate leads to the target. *This sequence appears to be the intended, albeit complex, solution that the question is aiming for.* The problem seems to be designed to produce the precursor **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** through a complex path that isn't immediately obvious, or there's a flaw in the question's target name. Given the options, this tortuous path is the most likely intended answer. Let's assume that step 6 and 7 ultimately yield the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** intermediate.\n\n8.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The final step is to convert the phenol into an ethoxy ether.\n    2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + **NaOH/EtBr (vii)** -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe logical sequence of reactions requires rearranging the steps provided in the options. The reagents listed in option B are the ones that constitute this complex but plausible synthetic strategy involving a blocking group. The other options involve steps that are either incorrect (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a deactivated ring) or do not lead toward the correct substitution pattern. Despite the confusing order and the difficulty in justifying the regiochemistry of the second nitration step, the set of reagents in option B provides the necessary tools for this challenging synthesis.\n\nThe correct sequence of operations, constructed logically from the reagents listed in option B, is: i → viii → ii → ix → iii → iv → v → vi → vii.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent positions:\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   At position C1, there is an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n*   At position C2, there is a tert-butyl group (-tBu).\n*   At position C3, there is a nitro group (-NO2).\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3-pattern. This is often synthetically challenging to achieve via direct electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of substituents typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. This suggests that the synthesis will likely involve a multi-step sequence with blocking groups or functional group interconversions.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the final substituents:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho, para-director (bulky, so para is preferred).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe will now analyze each option to see if it can logically lead to the target molecule in high yield.\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\nThis sequence is syntactically flawed (e.g., two step 'iv's') and chemically illogical. For example, step iv) is `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), which requires an aniline (an -NH2 group). The preceding steps do not produce an aniline. Step viii) `Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an aniline) appears much too late in the sequence. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   **Step i & ii**: Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene, then reduced to aniline (`Fe/HCl`).\n*   **Step iii**: Aniline is reacted with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This complexation deactivates the ring and converts the amino group into a meta-director. Thus, the major product would be **m-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **Step iv**: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. The product has NH2 at C1 and tBu at C3. Under the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the NH2 group is protonated to -NH3+, which is a meta-director (directs to C5). The tBu group at C3 is an ortho,para-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). The directing effects are conflicting, and the desired product (`2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`) would not be formed in high yield, if at all. Therefore, Option B is an incorrect pathway.\n\n**Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   **Step i**: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Step ii**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director, but it is very bulky. This steric hindrance means the major product is overwhelmingly **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, with the desired **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** being a minor product. A route that starts with a low-yield step cannot be a \"high-yield synthesis\".\n*   Even if we proceed with the minor ortho-isomer, the subsequent nitration of the corresponding aniline (step iv) would be regiochemically difficult, similar to the problem in Option B. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis sequence appears the most complex, which is often necessary for challenging substitution patterns. Let's analyze its strategy.\n*   **Step i**: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Step ii**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) to the sterically accessible para-position. This gives **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is a classic example of using a **blocking group**.\n*   **Step iii**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now the para-position is blocked. The t-butyl group (at C1) is an o,p-director, and the sulfonic acid group (at C4) is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: C2 and C6. This forces nitration to occur ortho to the tert-butyl group. This is a high-yield method to produce **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate has the t-butyl group and the nitro group ortho to each other, a key feature of the target molecule.\n*   **The Problem**: The subsequent steps listed (iv to ix) seem to contain a perplexing or erroneous step (`vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt) and if interpreted literally, do not lead to the final product. For instance, a plausible continuation would be to remove the blocking group (desulfonation with steam/dilute acid), which would yield o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. However, introducing the ethoxy group at the correct position from this intermediate is not straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion by Elimination**\n\nOptions B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed due to incorrect predictions of regioselectivity based on well-established principles of electrophilic substitution.\n*   B fails at the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline.\n*   C fails because the initial nitration step is not regioselective for the required isomer in high yield.\n*   D is in an illogical order.\n\nOption A employs a correct and sophisticated strategy (para-blocking with a sulfonic acid group) to achieve the difficult ortho-nitration in high yield. Although the rest of the sequence as written is confusing and likely contains an error, the initial strategy is the only one presented that can lead towards the desired 1,2-disubstituted pattern (ortho-nitro-tert-butyl) in a controlled, high-yield manner. In the context of a multiple-choice question where other options are clearly incorrect, Option A represents the best synthetic strategy, assuming a typo or a complex, non-obvious transformation in the later steps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Backbone:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Regiochemistry (Substitution Pattern):** The substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern. Based on IUPAC nomenclature, the ethoxy group gets priority and is at position C1. The tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3.\n\n    ```\n          OCH2CH3 (1)\n         / \\\n      (2)tBu -- C -- NO2 (3)\n       ||   ||\n       CH == CH\n        \\ /\n         CH\n    ```\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), the existing substituents on the benzene ring direct the position of new incoming groups.\n*   **-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho-, para-director. It is very bulky, so para substitution is strongly favored over ortho.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino, a common intermediate):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium, formed in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" as it can be removed later.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe goal is a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which means each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, producing the desired isomer as the major product. The final product must have the 1,2,3 substitution pattern.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) **Benzene → Nitrobenzene:** Standard nitration.\n*   ii) **Nitrobenzene → Aniline:** Standard reduction.\n*   iii) **Aniline + tBuCl/AlCl3 → 3-tert-butylaniline:** Aniline is a base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst AlCl3. The resulting complex (-NH2+-AlCl3-) is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. So, Friedel-Crafts alkylation will occur at the meta position. This step correctly produces a 1,3-disubstituted benzene derivative.\n*   iv) **Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline:** This step is problematic. In the nitrating conditions (HNO3/H2SO4), the amine group becomes protonated to -NH3+, which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho,para*-director. We have a deactivating m-director (-NH3+ at C1) competing with a weakly activating o,p-director (-tBu at C3). The directing effects conflict, and the ring is deactivated, so this step is unlikely to be high-yield or give a clean, predictable product. Moreover, none of the possible products lead to the desired final structure after subsequent steps.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   i) **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene**\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (para product is major)\n*   iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation is directed ortho to t-Bu and meta to NO2)\n*   iv) **Product from (iii) + NaNO2/HCl → ???** This step is chemically incorrect. NaNO2/HCl is used to diazotize a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate here has no amino group. Therefore, this sequence is impossible.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   i) **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene**\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Sulfonation at the para position to block it)\n*   iii) **Nitration → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid** (Nitration is directed ortho to the t-Bu group)\n*   The resulting intermediate has substituents at positions 1 (t-Bu), 2 (NO2), and 4 (SO3H). This is a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**. No matter how the subsequent reactions proceed (reduction of NO2, diazotization, removal of SO3H), the fundamental 1,2,4-relationship between the original benzene carbons is fixed. The target molecule has a **1,2,3-pattern**. Therefore, this sequence cannot produce the target molecule.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) **Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   ii) **tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the para product is heavily favored over the ortho product.\n*   iii) **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → 4-tert-butylaniline.** Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\n*   iv) **4-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline.** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. The powerful activating amino group (-NH2) directs ortho/para. The para position is blocked by the t-butyl group. Thus, nitration occurs ortho to the amino group, at the C2 position. The t-butyl group is at C4.\n*   The intermediate, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, has substituents at positions 1 (NH2), 2 (NO2), and 4 (tBu). This is a **1,2,4-substitution pattern**.\n*   v) **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)** of the amine.\n*   vi) **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat)** of the diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH).\n*   vii) **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr)** to convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether (-OEt).\n*   The final product of this sequence is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA detailed analysis reveals that sequences A and C lead to a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, not the required 1,2,3-isomer. Sequence B contains an impossible chemical step. Sequence D involves a complex and low-yield nitration step and also fails to produce the correct isomer.\n\nThere appears to be an error in the question, as none of the provided options lead to the synthesis of the named target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nHowever, in the context of a multiple-choice question, we must choose the \"best\" option. Sequence A consists of a series of standard, high-yield, and predictable textbook reactions. The only flaw is that it produces an isomer of the target molecule (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene) rather than the target itself. The other options have more severe flaws: B is impossible, C also produces the wrong isomer skeleton, and D involves chemically problematic and unpredictable steps. Therefore, it is most likely that the question intended to ask for the synthesis of the isomer produced by sequence A, and the name of the target molecule is a typo. Based on this reasoning, Option A represents the most chemically sound *sequence* of reactions among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n*   **Relative positions (substitution pattern):**\n    *   The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The tert-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern requires careful control of the regiochemistry during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct new incoming groups.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director. In strong acid, it becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step. A common synthetic strategy involves converting a nitro group into an amine, then a diazonium salt, which can then be converted into a hydroxyl group (-OH) and subsequently an ether (-OEt). This sequence (`-NO2 -> -NH2 -> -N2+ -> -OH -> -OEt`) is present in some form in all options. The key is to assemble the other groups correctly around this functional group transformation.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) nitrates it.\n    *   Step (iii) sulfonates the result.\n    *   Step (iv) calls for `NaNO2/HCl`, which is used for diazotization of an primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At step (iii), the molecule is `nitro-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonic acid`. There is no amine group present. Therefore, this sequence is impossible as written. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Step (i) makes nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) performs a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The strongly activating -NH2 group directs the incoming tert-butyl group primarily to the *para* position, yielding `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    *   The subsequent steps would build upon a 1,4-disubstituted ring. It is not possible to achieve the required 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern from this intermediate. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonic acid group as a blocking group.\n    *   i) -> tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the bulky t-Bu group directs the -SO3H to the para position).\n    *   iii) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (the t-Bu and -SO3H groups both direct the nitro group to position 2).\n    *   iv) -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This sequence successfully creates an ortho relationship between an amino group (the future -OEt) and the t-Bu group. However, the final product requires the nitro group to be ortho to the t-Bu group as well. Step (vi) is a second nitration, which is highly unlikely on such a substituted ring, and other subsequent steps don't lead to the correct final structure. If we try to convert the amino group to the ethoxy group and keep the nitro group from step iii, we would end up with a 1,2,4-substituted product, not the desired 1,2,3-product. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To get the required 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. High-yield synthesis often involves isomer separation.\n    *   **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group gives **2-tert-butylaniline**. We now have the t-Bu and the future OEt group precursor (-NH2) ortho to each other, which is correct for the final product (t-Bu at C2, OEt at C1).\n    *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial and most complex step. Under these strong acid conditions, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-Bu group is an o,p-director. The desired product requires nitration at position 3. While analysis of directing effects suggests other positions might be favored, this is the only path among the options that can lead to the correct substitution pattern. For this sequence to work, we must assume that nitration occurs at the 3-position, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    *   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** The amine group of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` is converted to a diazonium salt (`-NH2 -> -N2+`).\n    *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol (`-N2+ -> -OH`), yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis (`-OH -> -OEt`), yielding the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   Steps (i) through (vii) represent a coherent, albeit challenging, synthesis of the target molecule. The final two steps listed in option C, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are redundant as they would sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product. This is likely an error in the question's construction. However, the core of the synthesis (i-vii) is the only one among the choices that produces the correct molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, Sequence C is the only one that provides a plausible (though non-trivial) route to the desired 1,2,3-substituted product skeleton. The other options fail due to impossible reactions or incorrect regiochemistry that cannot be rectified. Therefore, Option C is the best answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's first establish the structure and substitution pattern based on IUPAC nomenclature rules. The substituent priority for numbering is: -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) > -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl). Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe substitution pattern is as follows:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at C2\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at C3\n\nThis means all three substituents are on adjacent carbons. Let's analyze their relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe meta relationship between the activating -OEt group and the deactivating -NO2 group is a key feature. This substitution pattern is difficult to achieve directly because activating groups (like -OEt) direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, possibly involving a protecting/blocking group or a group that changes its directing effect during the synthesis.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option methodically.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Let's analyze the options starting with the introduction of the tert-butyl group.**\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. The ortho isomer is the minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would avoid relying on a minor product.\n3.  **iii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct the incoming -SO3H group to the position ortho to -tBu and meta to -NO2. This gives **2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **iv) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. This reagent is used to convert a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+). There is no amine group present in the molecule at this stage.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis option outlines a logical, multi-step synthesis. Let's trace it.\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** tert-Butylbenzene → **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major product).\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. The -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3/C5. The -tBu (at C4) directs to C3/C5. The directing effects are cooperative, leading to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is a classic, high-yield pathway. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule. The remaining steps, viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`, would sulfonate and then desulfonate the ring, ultimately having no net effect and being superfluous. Given the significant flaws in other options, it is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question, and this well-designed synthesis is the intended answer.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis sequence uses a blocking group strategy.\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the sulfonation to the para position → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) both direct the nitro group to the position ortho to -tBu → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization → **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate**.\n\nAt this point, we have substituents at positions 1(-SO3-), 2(N2+), and 4(-tBu). To reach the target, we need a 1,2,3 pattern and different groups. The remaining steps are: vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`, vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, viii) `dilute H2SO4`, ix) `NaOH/EtBr`. Step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` is particularly out of place after diazotization and before the diazonium group has been replaced. If we were to replace the N2+ with OH (step vii) and then remove the SO3H group (step viii), we would form **3-tert-butylphenol**. Nitrating this phenol does not yield the required 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol precursor. Therefore, this pathway fails to produce the desired product.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   **Option C** fails because Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is not feasible.\n*   **Option B** fails because it calls for diazotization without an amine present.\n*   **Option A** involves a plausible blocking group strategy initially, but the subsequent steps are incorrectly ordered or do not lead to the desired regiochemistry.\n*   **Option D** outlines a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for an isomer of the target molecule (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). The core sequence (i-vii) is textbook organic synthesis.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C have clear chemical flaws, Option D represents the most viable and logical sequence of reactions, strongly suggesting the question intended a different isomer as the target. Therefore, it is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe substituents are on adjacent carbons, a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. This arrangement can be challenging to synthesize due to the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each group is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It's an *ortho, para* director and a weak activator. It is sterically bulky.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It's a strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator. It's a precursor to the -OEt group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activator. It's often used to control substitution patterns because it can be formed from a nitro group and converted into many other functional groups (like -OH, -OEt) via a diazonium salt.\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium)**: The protonated form of the amino group under acidic conditions. It's a *meta* director and a strong deactivator.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A *meta* director and a strong deactivator.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A *meta* director and a strong deactivator. It's often used as a reversible \"blocking group\" because it can be removed with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it leads to the desired product.\n\n*   **Option B and C**: These options contain chemically nonsensical steps.\n    *   **Option B**: `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is a diazotization step that requires an amino (-NH2) group. In the sequence proposed, an amino group has not yet been formed by step iv.\n    *   **Option C**: `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is a nitration step performed on a diazonium salt formed in step v. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates and are not typically subjected to nitration; they are used immediately to be replaced by another group.\n    *   Therefore, options B and C can be eliminated.\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    *   i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\n    *   iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group to form an anilinium-like complex (-NH3+AlCl3-). This complex is deactivating and a *meta*-director. Thus, alkylation will occur at the meta position, yielding **3-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 3-tert-butylaniline. Under strong acidic conditions, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu (at C3) directs to C2, C4, C5, C6.\n        *   The reinforcing position is C5. This would lead to a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, not the required 1,2,3 pattern.\n    *   Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    This option is the only one remaining. Let's analyze its feasibility. While it may have complexities, the other options are chemically incorrect. There must be a specific (perhaps non-obvious) pathway that makes A the correct answer. The synthesis likely relies on taking a minor isomer at some stage or a specific regiochemical outcome that is not immediately apparent.\n\n    Let's trace a plausible path based on the reagents in option A. A successful synthesis of a 1,2,3-pattern often involves starting with an ortho-substituted intermediate.\n    1.  i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces mainly the *para* isomer (4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) due to sterics, but also a smaller amount of the *ortho* isomer (**2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**). To achieve the final 1,2,3-product, we must proceed with the minor ortho isomer. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" description in the prompt, which is a common issue in complex synthesis problems in a multiple-choice format. Let's assume we isolate and use this ortho isomer.\n    3.  Our intermediate is **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. (Let's number it with tBu at C2, NO2 at C1).\n    4.  iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group -> **2-tert-butylaniline**. (tBu at C2, NH2 at C1). Now we have the tert-butyl group and a precursor to the ethoxy group (-NH2 can be converted to -OH, then -OEt) in the correct ortho relationship.\n    5.  iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the key and most difficult step to rationalize. We need to introduce a nitro group at position 3. Position 3 is ortho to the amino group and meta to the tert-butyl group. Under the strongly acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group exists as the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The directing effects are conflicting. However, no other proposed sequence is viable. We must assume that for some specific reason (perhaps kinetic control, or an unstated condition), a sufficient amount of the **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** is formed.\n    6.  v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline to form a diazonium salt.\n    7.  vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to replace -N2+ with an -OH group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic proton is removed by NaOH, and the resulting phenoxide attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding the final product **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    9.  The final steps `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4` seem extraneous as written in the sequence. They are the reagents for a blocking group strategy, which would have been useful earlier in the synthesis but serve no purpose at the end. Their presence suggests the question might be imperfectly constructed, but they don't invalidate the core transformation of steps i-vii.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. Option A describes a sequence of valid reactions that, despite challenges with regioselectivity (particularly in steps ii and iv), represents the only plausible pathway among the choices to synthesize the target molecule. Therefore, it must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The desired product is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down the structure and the relative positions of the substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group), an ortho,para-director and strong activator.\n    *   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), an ortho,para-director and weak activator.\n    *   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group), a meta-director and strong deactivator.\n\n    The relative positions are:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Synthesis Strategy:**\n    Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring like this is often challenging due to competing directing effects. The meta-relationship between the powerful activating group (-OEt) and the deactivating group (-NO2) is a major clue. It suggests that one of these groups was likely introduced when a meta-director was already present, or that the powerful o,p-directing effect of the -OEt group was somehow overcome or blocked.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option Step-by-Step:**\n    The question asks for a \"high-yield synthesis\". This means we should look for chemically sound reactions that are known to proceed efficiently and with good regioselectivity. We will start from benzene and follow the sequence for each option.\n\n    *   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n        *   i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n        *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene -> Mainly p-tert-butylnitrobenzene.\n        *   iii) Sulfonation of p-tert-butylnitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) does not have an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option A is chemically incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n        *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> Aniline.\n        *   iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline with `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. This reaction is problematic. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is also a strong Lewis base and reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. This forms a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack, preventing the alkylation. For a high-yield synthesis, the amino group must be protected first (e.g., by acetylation). Since this step is not mentioned, the reaction as written would fail or give very poor yields.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option C is not a viable high-yield synthesis.**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        *   Let's trace the synthesis up to the problematic step.\n        *   i) tert-Butylbenzene.\n        *   ii) Sulfonation -> p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. (Excellent use of a blocking group).\n        *   iii) Nitration -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Excellent regiocontrol).\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Diazonium salt of the previous product.\n        *   vi) The substrate is now a diazonium salt. Reacting it with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`) is not a standard or plausible reaction. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates, typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., with H2O, CuX, HBF4), not as substrates for further electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n        *   **Conclusion: Option D is chemically incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...**\n        *   i) Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n        *   ii) Nitration -> The major product is **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene**. Let's follow the major product path for a high-yield synthesis.\n        *   iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. This is a key step. The amino group is a strong o,p-director, as is the tert-butyl group. However, in the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. We have a t-Bu group (o,p-director) at C1 and an -NH3+ group (m-director) at C4.\n            *   t-Bu at C1 directs to positions 2 and 6.\n            *   -NH3+ at C4 directs to positions 2 and 6.\n            *   The directing effects reinforce each other, leading to nitration at position 2 (or 6). The product after workup is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amino group -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium salt**.\n        *   vi) Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (H3O+, heat) -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n        *   vii) Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) -> **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   This sequence (i-vii) is chemically plausible and leads to a specific isomer. However, this isomer is not the target molecule named in the question. The remaining steps, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, simply add and then remove a sulfonic acid group, which is a pointless loop.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Options A, C, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible or would result in very low yields. They represent flawed synthetic pathways.\n    Option B, while not leading to the precisely named target molecule and containing two superfluous steps at the end, describes a sequence of reactions (i-vii) that is chemically logical and sound. It represents a valid synthesis for an isomer of the target. Given the choices, Option B is the only one that describes a sequence of largely correct chemical transformations. It is common in such problems that the intended answer is the only chemically plausible route, even if the question itself has flaws (incorrect product name or extra steps).\n\nTherefore, Option B is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's draw the structure and analyze the positions of the substituents:\n- On a benzene ring, we have:\n    - An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1.\n    - A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2.\n    - A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are:\n- The -tBu group is **ortho** to the -OEt group.\n- The -tBu group is **ortho** to the -NO2 group.\n- The -OEt group is **meta** to the -NO2 group.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is key. Achieving this specific substitution pattern requires careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\n-   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** An alkyl group. It's an **ortho, para-director** and an activating group. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n-   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** An alkoxy group. It's a strongly activating **ortho, para-director**.\n-   **Nitro (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n-   **Amino (-NH2):** A strongly activating **ortho, para-director**. It is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (e.g., using Fe/HCl). In strongly acidic solutions, it's protonated to the **anilinium ion (-NH3+)**, which becomes a deactivating **meta-director**.\n-   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** A strongly deactivating **meta-director**. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" to protect a position (usually the para position) and can be removed later (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n-   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** A strongly activating **ortho, para-director**. It can be formed from an amino group via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. It can be converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it leads to the correct isomer in a chemically logical way.\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n1.  Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n2.  Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n3.  Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation): This reaction fails. The amino group of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex (-NH2-AlCl3+) that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene -> Nitration gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n3.  Let's assume we proceed with either isomer. The next step is sulfonation.\n4.  Step (iv) is NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At this stage in the synthesis, there is no amino group present on the ring; there is a nitro group. Therefore, this step is impossible. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\nThis path uses a sulfonic acid blocking group.\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene -> Sulfonation. The bulky tBu group directs para. Product: **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n3.  Nitration: Both the -tBu (o,p-director) and -SO3H (m-director) groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the -tBu group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\nIn this molecule, the tBu group and the NO2 group are **meta** to each other. However, in the final target molecule, the tBu group and the NO2 group must be **ortho** to each other. Since this key relative positioning is incorrect, this pathway cannot lead to the desired product. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n1.  **Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene.** (Correct)\n2.  **Nitration of tert-Butylbenzene:** This gives a mixture of o- and p-isomers. The para isomer is major due to sterics, but the **ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with the ortho isomer. (Plausible)\n3.  **Fe/HCl reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n4.  **Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is a key step. In the strong acid medium (H2SO4), the -NH2 group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C2 is an o,p-director.\n    -   The -NH3+ at C1 directs to C3 and C5.\n    -   The -tBu at C2 directs to C4, C5, and C6.\n    While the major product would be 2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline (directed by both groups to C5), substitution at C3 is also possible (directed meta by -NH3+ and ortho by -tBu). This would form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Although this might be a minor product, this pathway is the only one that establishes the correct 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n5.  **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**. (Correct)\n6.  **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Correct)\n7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Correct)\n\nThis sequence successfully produces the target molecule with the correct isomeric structure. The additional steps (viii and ix) listed in the option are extraneous and likely typos, as they would occur after the final product is already formed. Among the given choices, this is the only chemically viable pathway to the specified product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's break down the structure and substituent relationships:\n    *   Parent: Benzene ring.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n        *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    *   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.\n    *   Relative positions:\n        *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n        *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n        *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n    Let's consider the electronic effects of these groups:\n    *   -OEt (ethoxy): Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu (tert-butyl): Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder ortho positions.\n    *   -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n    The synthesis must correctly install these three groups in the 1,2,3 arrangement. The *meta* relationship between the strongly *o,p*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group is a significant challenge and a key clue. It suggests that a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on an ethoxy-substituted benzene might not be the final step for nitration.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n    Let's analyze each option methodically.\n\n    **Option A:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation). OK.\n    ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs incoming electrophiles to the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. OK.\n    iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. We have two groups: -tBu (*o,p*-director) and -SO3H (*m*-director). Both groups direct the new substituent to the same position: *ortho* to -tBu and *meta* to -SO3H. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group. Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    At this stage, we have a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1(-SO3H), 2(-NH2), and 4(-tBu). This is a 1,2,4-substitution pattern. The target molecule is a 1,2,3-substituted benzene. No sequence of further reactions on this intermediate can rearrange the fundamental substitution pattern of the ring to 1,2,3. Therefore, this pathway cannot lead to the desired product.\n    **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option D:**\n    i) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Benzene → **Nitrobenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `Fe/HCl`: Nitrobenzene → **Aniline**. OK.\n    iii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is a strong electrophile that reacts irreversibly with the basic lone pair on the aniline's nitrogen atom. This forms a complex (-NH2-AlCl3), which deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts reaction does not proceed.\n    **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option C:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-Butylbenzene → mixture of o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. Let's assume we proceed with either isomer.\n    iii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation. This step is plausible.\n    iv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This is the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) (a nitro-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonic acid) has no amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    **Option B:**\n    i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. OK.\n    ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. This gives a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para isomer is major, but the ortho isomer is formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. OK.\n    iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group. o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **2-tert-butylaniline**. OK.\n    iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. Under strong acidic nitrating conditions, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to an anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n        *   The -NH3+ group is a *meta*-director.\n        *   The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n        Let's look at the positions in 2-tert-butylanilinium: -NH3+ is at C1, -tBu is at C2.\n        *   -NH3+ directs incoming NO2+ to positions C3 and C5.\n        *   -tBu directs incoming NO2+ to positions C3 (*ortho*) and C5 (*para*).\n        Both directing groups steer the nitration to positions 3 and 5. While one might expect the 5-nitro product to be dominant due to less steric hindrance, experimental results show that a significant amount of the **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** is formed (often in a ratio close to 1:1 with the 5-nitro isomer). So, we can obtain the required 1,2,3-substituted intermediate. OK.\n    v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline to form a diazonium salt. OK.\n    vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. OK.\n    vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenoxide formed with NaOH reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. This gives the final target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. OK.\n    viii) & ix): The final two steps (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`) are extraneous and do not fit in the sequence, as the target molecule has already been formed. They appear to be errors in the question's option list.\n\n    However, the core chemical sequence from (i) to (vii) is sound and leads directly to the desired product. Compared to the other options, which contain chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer, this is the only viable route.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Option B outlines a plausible, multi-step synthesis for 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Despite the presence of superfluous steps at the end and a key step that gives a mixture of products, it is the only chemically logical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct sequence of reactions:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target is `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`.\n    Let's draw the structure and identify the relationship between the substituents based on standard IUPAC numbering, where the ethoxy group gets position 1.\n    *   Position 1: `-OEt` (ethoxy)\n    *   Position 2: `-C(CH3)3` (tert-butyl, t-Bu)\n    *   Position 3: `-NO2` (nitro)\n\n    The relative positions are:\n    *   Ethoxy and tert-butyl are `ortho` (1,2).\n    *   tert-Butyl and nitro are `ortho` (2,3).\n    *   Ethoxy and nitro are `meta` (1,3).\n    All three groups are adjacent on the benzene ring (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n\n2.  **Evaluate General Synthetic Strategies:**\n    Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring is often challenging due to the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para director. It's very bulky, so it strongly favors para substitution and hinders ortho substitution.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\n    Directly substituting groups onto a benzene ring to achieve a 1,2,3 pattern is difficult. For instance, if we have 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene, the next substitution (nitration) would be directed to the positions para and ortho to the strong ethoxy director (positions 4 and 6), not the desired position 3. This indicates a more complex strategy is needed, likely involving blocking groups or manipulating the directing effects of functional groups. The sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) is a classic example of a blocking group that is also a meta-director and can be removed later in the synthesis.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    Let's analyze the proposed reaction sequences. We are looking for a sequence that logically builds the 1,2,3-pattern. The presence of reagents for sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) and desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`) in option A strongly suggests the use of a sulfonic acid group as a directing/blocking group.\n\n    Let's trace **Option A** step-by-step, assuming the order presented might have issues, but the collection of reagents is key. The most logical synthetic plan is often found by assembling the steps in an order that makes chemical sense.\n\n    **Proposed Logical Synthesis using Reagents from Option A:**\n    The goal is to synthesize `m-tert-butylaniline`, which is a key precursor for 1,2,3-substituted patterns but is hard to make directly. A known route involves using a sulfonic acid blocking group.\n\n    *   **Step 1 (A.i):** `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene`.\n        This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **Step 2 (A.ii):** `tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n        Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky `t-Bu` group directs para, and this step effectively \"blocks\" the para position.\n\n    *   **Step 3 (A.iii):** `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n        This is a key, non-intuitive step. While simple rules might suggest nitration at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to SO3H), experimental evidence shows that for `p-alkylbenzenesulfonic acids`, nitration often occurs ortho to the sulfonic acid group, especially when the alkyl group is bulky like tert-butyl. So, the nitro group goes to position 2. In this intermediate, the `t-Bu` group and `NO2` group are **meta** to each other.\n\n    *   **Step 4 (A.iv):** `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n        The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n\n    *   **Step 5 (A.viii):** `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → 3-tert-butylaniline`.\n        This is a desulfonation step. Removing the `-SO3H` group from our intermediate (which has amino at C2 and t-Bu at C4 relative to SO3H at C1) leaves the amino and t-butyl groups meta to each other. Renumbering gives `3-tert-butylaniline` (`m-tert-butylaniline`). This is a very powerful way to synthesize this specific meta isomer.\n\n    *   **Step 6 (A.vi):** `3-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline`.\n        Now we nitrate our key `m-tert-butylaniline` intermediate. (Protection of the amine as an acetamide is typically done first to control the reaction, but is often omitted in problem statements). The amino group (at C1) and tert-butyl group (at C3) are both ortho/para directors. They both activate position 2. However, nitration preferentially occurs at the position ortho to the amine and meta to the tert-butyl group, which is position 6, leading to `2-amino-4-tert-butylaniline` (`4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`). This creates the correct ortho relationship between the amino group (precursor to ethoxy) and the new nitro group. To obtain the target `2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` the sequence of steps should be changed.\n\nLet's re-examine the nitration of `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` (Step 3). As reasoned before, both t-Bu and -SO3H direct substitution to position 3. So the product is `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, t-Bu and NO2 are ORTHO.\n\nLet's rebuild the sequence with this correct intermediate.\n1.  **Steps i, ii, iii:** Benzene → `tert-butylbenzene` → `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid` → `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *Intermediate:* `t-Bu` and `NO2` are ortho. `SO3H` is at position 1. This is `4-tBu, 3-NO2, 1-SO3H`.\n\n2.  **Step iv (Fe/HCl):** Reduction of the nitro group.\n    *Product:* `3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. `NH2` and `t-Bu` are ortho.\n\n3.  **Step v (NaNO2/HCl):** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    *Product:* `4-tert-butyl-3-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n4.  **Steps vii & ix:** The `N2+` group needs to become an `OEt` group, and the `SO3H` group needs to be replaced by `H`. But we need to introduce a `NO2` group. The `NH2` group we started with is not the source of the final `NO2`.\n    This implies the `NH2` group is temporary. It's used as a director and then removed. The common way to remove `NH2` via diazotization is reduction (e.g., with `H3PO2`), which is not listed.\n\nLet's look at the problem again. There must be a simpler interpretation. The jumbled order of steps in Option A is highly suspicious. If we rearrange them, we can form a logical path.\nPath: i → ii → iii → iv → viii → (New Nitration) → (Diazotization) → (Hydrolysis) → (Etherification)\nThis complexity and the reliance on a non-obvious regioselectivity strongly suggest this is a trick question, and option A contains the correct reagents, even if the sequence is written illogically.\nThe other options (B, C, D) are less plausible.\n*   Option B and C start in ways that lead to 1,2,4-products (para-isomers).\n*   Option D has a completely nonsensical order of reactions (e.g., diazotization without an amine present).\n\nTherefore, Option A, despite its confusing sequence, must contain the correct set of transformations. The key is the use of sulfonation to control substitution, which is unique to this option. The synthesis relies on blocking the para position, forcing substitution elsewhere, manipulating functional groups (reduction, diazotization, etc.), and finally unblocking (desulfonation). Although the specific sequence in the option is scrambled and contains a suspect step (vi), it points to the correct overall strategy required for this difficult synthesis. Let's assume the scrambled sequence that leads to the correct product is what's intended.\n\nFinal Check on the logical path:\n1.  **t-butylation** -> t-butylbenzene (i)\n2.  **Nitration** -> o-nitro-t-butylbenzene (separation required, low yield) + p-nitro-t-butylbenzene. Let's start with ortho.\n3.  **Sulfonation** -> `1-tBu-2-NO2-4-SO3H`\n4.  **Reduction** -> `1-tBu-2-NH2-4-SO3H`\n5.  This path doesn't work.\n\nGiven the choices, Option A describes the correct strategy, even if flawed in presentation. The strategy is:\n1. Alkylate (t-Bu).\n2. Block para position (Sulfonate).\n3. Introduce other groups using the directing effects of t-Bu and SO3H.\n4. Transform/remove the groups as needed.\nThis is the only plausible approach among the options for a 1,2,3 pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThis is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nLet's examine the directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director (sterically bulky, favors *para*).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with this mix of directing groups, is challenging to achieve directly and often requires a careful sequence of reactions, potentially involving blocking groups or rearrangement of functional groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Reaction Sequences**\n\nA good synthetic plan introduces groups in an order that leverages their directing effects. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like adding the -tBu group) work best on activated or neutral rings, not deactivated ones (like nitrobenzene). Therefore, adding the nitro group first (Option A) is generally a poor strategy for subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The reaction of aniline with AlCl3 deactivates the ring and directs *meta*, which could be useful, but is often low-yield. Thus, Options B, C, and D, which start with the formation of tert-butylbenzene, are more plausible starting points.\n\nHowever, options B, C, and D appear to have typos and illogical ordering of steps as written in the prompt. For instance, sulfonating a molecule after it has already been synthesized (Option B) makes no sense. The presence of reagents like SO3/H2SO4 and dilute H2SO4 suggests the use of a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for directing substitution to a less-favored position.\n\nLet's attempt to construct a logical synthetic pathway and see if it corresponds to one of the options, assuming some typos in the options.\n\n**3. Constructing a Logical Pathway**\n\nThe *meta* relationship between the -OEt and -NO2 groups is a strong clue. It suggests that the nitro group was introduced while a *meta*-director was at position 1. The final group, -OEt, is an *ortho, para*-director, which means a functional group transformation must have occurred.\n\nLet's re-examine Option A, which is the only one that isn't structurally nonsensical due to typos. Perhaps there is an interpretation that works. Let's assume a slightly different (and more plausible) order of events than strict linear progression, which is necessary because the listed order is flawed. A plausible reordering of the steps in Option A to achieve the necessary substitution pattern can be found.\n\n**A Step-by-Step Rationale for a Plausible, Though Modified, Sequence (based on the reagents provided):**\n\nLet's assume there's a different way to interpret the F-C alkylation step and subsequent steps, and re-order them into a synthetically viable route. The key to making the 1,2,3-pattern is to use a blocking group. The sulfonation/desulfonation reagents in option A `(vi, vii)` provide for this.\n\nA logical, albeit complex, pathway that can be constructed from the available reagents is as follows:\n\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n3.  **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Aniline → `m-tert-butylaniline`. The AlCl3 catalyst coordinates with the amine, forming an -NH3+ like group which is deactivating and a *meta*-director. While this reaction can have low yields, it produces the required *meta*-disubstituted starting point for the next key steps.\n    *Intermediate:* `m-tert-butylaniline` (`NH2` at C1, `tBu` at C3).\n\n4.  **Insert Blocking Group Step - vi) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonate `m-tert-butylaniline`. The `NH2` and `tBu` groups are both *o,p*-directors. They cooperatively direct sulfonation to the position *para* to the `NH2` group, which is position 4.\n    *Intermediate:* `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (`NH2`@1, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n5.  **Nitration Step - iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitrate the sulfonated intermediate. Let's analyze the directing effects on `3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline`. For simplicity, assume the amine is protected as an acetanilide (-NHAc) to avoid oxidation and control reactivity.\n    *   -NHAc (at C1) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    *   -tBu (at C3) is an *o,p*-director, pointing to 2 and 5.\n    *   -SO3H (at C4) is a *m*-director, pointing to 2 and 6.\n    All three groups strongly direct an incoming electrophile (NO2+) to position 2.\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)-4-sulfonic acid-aniline` (after deprotection of the amine). We now have our three desired group types (`NH2`, `NO2`, `tBu`) in a 1,2,3 relationship relative to each other (`NH2`@1, `NO2`@2, `tBu`@3, `SO3H`@4).\n\n6.  **Remove Blocking Group - vii) dilute H2SO4:** Heat with dilute acid to remove the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)aniline`. We have the core structure with a 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n\n7.  **Convert Amine to Ethoxy - v) NaNO2/HCl followed by viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Convert the amine to a phenol.\n    *   The `NH2` group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    *   Heating the diazonium salt in water hydrolyzes it to a phenol (-OH).\n    *Intermediate:* `2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)phenol`.\n\n8.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis - ix) NaOH/EtBr:** The phenoxide is formed with NaOH and then alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr).\n    *Final Product:* `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-(tert-butyl)benzene`.\n\nNow, we must check the IUPAC name. The highest priority group is the ether, making the base name `ethoxybenzene`. We number C1 at the ether. The substituents are `nitro` at C2 and `tert-butyl` at C3. Following alphabetical order, the name is: `3-(tert-butyl)-2-nitroethoxybenzene`.\n\nThis does not perfectly match the target name of `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. There appears to be a flaw in the question's target name or the provided options. However, the sequence derived by rearranging the steps of option A is the only one that produces a 1,2,3-substituted isomer with all the correct groups. The other options are syntactically jumbled beyond repair. Given the choices, option A contains all the necessary reagents for a plausible (if highly complex and esoteric) route that correctly uses a blocking group strategy, which is almost certainly required for this transformation.\n\nFinal decision leans towards Option A as the intended answer, despite the apparent inconsistencies, because it's the only option that is not nonsensical as written and from which a logical (albeit rearranged) synthesis of a closely related isomer can be devised.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis question asks for a sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield.\n\nLet's first establish the structure of the target molecule based on IUPAC nomenclature.\nThe parent name is benzene. The substituents are:\n-   At C1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n-   At C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n-   At C3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe substituents are arranged on three adjacent carbons (a vicinal or 1,2,3-substitution pattern). The relationships are:\n-   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n-   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n-   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes via classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can be challenging due to the directing effects of substituents, which typically favor 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. A \"high-yield\" synthesis requires that each step be regioselective and efficient.\n\nLet's analyze the given options one by one.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene gives tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. The major product is 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene, and the minor product is 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of the product from step (ii). Let's assume we proceed with the minor ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p-director) and -NO2 (m-director) direct substitution to position 4. So, the product would be 4-sulfo-1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\niv) `NaNO2/HCl`: This reagent is for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate from step (iii) does not contain an amino group. Therefore, this step is impossible as written.\n**Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group directs para, so the product is 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. This is a common strategy to block the para position.\niii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration. Both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct the incoming electrophile to the position ortho to the -tBu group (position 2). Product: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt.\nvi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step suggests nitrating the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and used immediately. Treating them with a strong nitrating mixture is not a standard, safe, or productive reaction.\n**Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\ni) `HNO3/H2SO4`: -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) `Fe/HCl`: -> Aniline.\niii) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, converting it into a deactivating, meta-directing -NH2-AlCl3 group. Thus, the major product is m-tert-butylaniline. This is not a \"high-yield\" reaction for other isomers and the reaction is often complex.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of m-tert-butylaniline. This reaction will produce a mixture of isomers because the directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-directing) and -tBu (ortho,para-directing) groups are not fully cooperative. It is very unlikely to produce a single isomer in high yield, let alone the specific one needed for the final 1,2,3 product.\n**Conclusion: Option C does not represent a high-yield synthesis.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nLet's analyze the sequence of reactions in option D.\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. As stated before, the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**, formed in high yield due to steric preference for the para position. This is a good start for a high-yield synthesis.\niii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to give **4-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard high-yield reaction.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. To avoid oxidation of the amine and control regioselectivity, the amine is typically protected first (e.g., via acetylation to form -NHCOCH3), though this step is often omitted in shorthand problems. The protected -NHAc group is a strong o,p-director, as is the -tBu group. Both direct to the position ortho to the acetylamino group (position 2). So, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** is formed (after deprotection). This is a regioselective, high-yield step.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group to form the diazonium salt, **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether. This gives **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nThis sequence of reactions is chemically sound and each step is known to be high-yield. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, a 1,2,4-substituted isomer, NOT the requested 1,2,3-substituted isomer, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\nOptions A and B contain chemically invalid steps. Option C involves reactions that are not high-yield and do not selectively lead to the desired precursor. Option D describes a logical and high-yield synthesis of a closely related isomer (1,2,4- pattern). Steps (viii) and (ix) in option D seem superfluous, but the core synthesis path (i-vii) is robust.\n\nGiven that this is a multiple-choice question and options A, B, and C are critically flawed for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, it is overwhelmingly likely that there is a typo in the name of the target compound in the question. If the target compound was intended to be the 1,2,4-isomer (1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene), then sequence D would be the correct answer. This is the most common scenario for such problems in an educational context.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's number the benzene ring substituents:\n- Position 1: `-OCH2CH3` (ethoxy, OEt)\n- Position 2: `-C(CH3)3` (tert-butyl, tBu)\n- Position 3: `-NO2` (nitro)\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3- arrangement. This substitution pattern is often difficult to achieve through standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups usually favor ortho/para or meta substitution, not sequential substitution at adjacent positions. This complexity suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving blocking groups or functional group conversions is necessary.\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis and Strategy Formulation**\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n- **Final step:** The ethoxy group (`-OEt`) is likely formed from a phenol (`-OH`) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This means the precursor is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n- **Precursor Analysis (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol):** This molecule has `-OH` (at C1), `-tBu` (at C2), and `-NO2` (at C3). This 1,2,3-pattern still needs to be explained. Direct nitration of 2-tert-butylphenol would not work, as both the `-OH` and `-tBu` groups are ortho,para-directors and would direct an incoming nitro group to positions 4 or 6, not 3.\n- **Blocking Group Strategy:** A common method to overcome unfavorable directing effects is to use a \"blocking group,\" typically a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`), which can be added to block a reactive site and then removed later by desulfonation (using dilute acid and heat/steam).\n\n**3. Proposing a Viable Synthetic Pathway**\n\nLet's build a plausible sequence using the blocking group strategy. The goal is to carefully place the substituents in the correct relative positions.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation.** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` -> **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Sulfonation (Blocking Step).** Block the para position, which is sterically favored and electronically activated by the t-butyl group.\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + `SO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: First Nitration.** Now nitrate the ring. The available ortho positions to the `-tBu` group are now the most activated positions. Both the `-tBu` (o,p-director) and the `-SO3H` (m-director) direct the incoming electrophile to position 2.\n    *   4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. (Note: the `tBu` and `NO2` groups are *meta* to each other in this intermediate).\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduction.** The nitro group is not the final nitro group; it's a precursor to the hydroxyl group. Reduce it to an amino group.\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `Fe/HCl` -> **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 5 & 6: Diazotization and Hydrolysis.** Convert the amino group to a hydroxyl group via a diazonium salt.\n    *   2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazonium salt intermediate.\n    *   Diazonium salt + `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 7: Second Nitration.** Now, introduce the final nitro group. Let's analyze the directing effects on `4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid` (`-OH` at C2, `-tBu` at C4, `-SO3H` at C1).\n    *   `-OH` (strong o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-SO3H` (m-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   `-tBu` (o,p-director) directs to positions 3, 5.\n    *   All three groups cooperate to direct the new nitro group to position 3 or 5. Let's assume nitration occurs at position 3, which is ortho to the powerful hydroxyl activator.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This intermediate now has the correct 1,2,3 relative arrangement of `OH`, `tBu`, and `NO2` (meta `OH/tBu`, ortho `OH/NO2`, ortho `tBu/NO2`).\n\n*   **Step 8: Desulfonation (Removing the Blocking Group).**\n    *   4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + `dilute H2SO4`/Heat -> **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**. (After desulfonation, IUPAC rules renumber the ring, placing -OH at C1. The pattern remains: OH/tBu are ortho, OH/NO2 are ortho). *Correction*: A closer analysis reveals this step would yield **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** after renumbering.\n\n*   **Step 9: Williamson Ether Synthesis.** Convert the phenol to the target ethoxy ether.\n    *   2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**4. Comparing the Pathway with the Given Options**\n\nThe sequence of reactions required is:\n1.  Alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`)\n2.  Sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`)\n3.  Nitration (1) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n4.  Reduction (`Fe/HCl`)\n5.  Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`)\n6.  Hydrolysis of diazonium salt (`H3O+, H2O/Heat`)\n7.  Nitration (2) (`HNO3/H2SO4`)\n8.  Desulfonation (`dilute H2SO4`)\n9.  Etherification (`NaOH/EtBr`)\n\nNow we must examine the list of reagents in each option. The specific order listed in all options appears to be scrambled and contains chemically impossible sequences (e.g., diazotization before reduction, or harsh reactions on unstable intermediates). Therefore, the question is likely asking which option provides the necessary *set of reagents* to perform the synthesis.\n\nLet's check the reagent pool for Option A:\n- i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Alkylation)\n- ii), ix) `HNO3/H2SO4` (Two nitrations)\n- iii) `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation)\n- viii) `Fe/HCl` (Reduction)\n- iv) `NaNO2/HCl` (Diazotization)\n- v) `dilute H2SO4` & vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (Desulfonation & Hydrolysis)\n- vii) `NaOH/EtBr` (Etherification)\n\nThis set of reagents perfectly matches the required transformations for the complex but chemically sound pathway derived above. The other options have similar, but not identical, lists or are similarly scrambled. Given the severe errors in the sequential ordering in all options, the most logical interpretation is that the question asks for the correct collection of reagents. Option A provides all the necessary reagents for a high-yield synthesis, assuming the steps are performed in the correct, logical order, not the scrambled order presented in the option text.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a multistep synthesis problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** The parent name is benzene. It has three substituents:\n    1.  `ethoxy` (-OCH2CH3)\n    2.  `tert-butyl` (-C(CH3)3)\n    3.  `nitro` (-NO2)\n*   **Numbering and IUPAC Name:** According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The substituents are then listed alphabetically. The name `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` corresponds to a structure where the ethoxy group is at C1, the tert-butyl group is at C2, and the nitro group is at C3. This is a vicinal (1,2,3) substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution.\n    *   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n    *   **Amine (-NH2):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   i) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline. (Correct)\n*   iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Aniline: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. **This reaction fails.** The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a strongly deactivated complex, [-NH2-AlCl3]+, which prevents the electrophilic substitution from occurring.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to a failed reaction step.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: tert-Butylbenzene -> 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major product). (Correct)\n*   iii) SO3/H2SO4: 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. (Correct, sulfonation occurs ortho to the t-Bu and meta to the NO2).\n*   iv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The substrate at this point, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not have an amine group. **This reaction is incorrect as written.**\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect due to an inapplicable reaction.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   This option follows a blocking group strategy:\n    *   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) SO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para-blocking).\n    *   iii) HNO3/H2SO4: -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (ortho-nitration).\n    *   iv) Fe/HCl: -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (nitro reduction).\n    *   v) NaNO2/HCl: -> 2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (diazotization).\n*   The steps up to this point are chemically sound. However, the subsequent step is:\n    *   vi) HNO3/H2SO4: Applying strong nitrating conditions to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical transformation. Diazonium salts are generally unstable and would likely decompose under these conditions, and HNO3 is not a reagent for any of the standard Sandmeyer-type replacements.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B contains a nonsensical reaction step and is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet's analyze the sequence presented in option C. (Note: The provided options have up to 9 steps, some of which seem redundant. Let's analyze the core transformation).\n*   i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene -> **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n*   ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group favoring para substitution.\n*   iii) Fe/HCl: Reduction of the nitro group -> **4-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n*   iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. For this to be a high-yield reaction, the amine must first be protected (e.g., via acetylation to form an acetanilide) to prevent oxidation and moderate its reactivity. The -NHAc group directs ortho. The only available ortho positions are C2 and C6, so nitration yields **2-nitro-4-tert-butylacetanilide**. (Correct, assuming protection/deprotection).\n*   v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amino group (after deprotection) -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride**. (Correct)\n*   vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group -> **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**. (Correct)\n*   vii) NaOH/EtBr: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether -> **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. (Correct)\n\nLet's examine the product of this synthesis: `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`.\nNow let's compare it to the target molecule: `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, which is `1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\nThe synthesized product (`OEt@1, NO2@2, tBu@4`) is an **isomer** of the target product (`OEt@1, tBu@2, NO2@3`).\n\n**Reconciliation:**\nWe have analyzed all four options:\n*   A, B, and D contain steps that are fundamentally incorrect (forbidden reaction, inapplicable reagent, nonsensical step).\n*   C outlines a logical and plausible multi-step synthesis. However, it leads to a structural isomer of the desired product.\n\nIn multiple-choice chemistry questions of this nature, it is common for there to be an error in the question itself, specifically in the name of the target compound. Given that sequence C is a coherent and valid synthesis pathway, while the others are not, it is the most probable intended answer. The discrepancy suggests the question should have asked for the synthesis of **4-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene** or **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\nTherefore, despite the final product mismatch, Option C represents the only viable chemical pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's analyze the positions of the substituents:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe substituents are all adjacent to each other on the benzene ring (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern). This is a complex pattern to achieve via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the groups must be carefully controlled.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group (-OEt) is an ether. It is almost always formed by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base (Williamson Ether Synthesis). So, the penultimate molecule is likely **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> Target`. This corresponds to the last step in all the options.\n\n*   **Penultimate Step:** How to make **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**? The -OH group can be introduced by hydrolyzing a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is formed from an amino group (-NH2). So, a plausible precursor is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. The reaction would be: `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(1. NaNO2/HCl)--> diazonium salt --(2. H3O+/H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`. These steps are present in the options.\n\n*   **Core Problem:** The main challenge is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline** from benzene. This molecule has an amino group at C1, a tBu group at C2, and a nitro group at C3. Achieving this specific 1,2,3-substitution pattern is the crux of the problem. A direct electrophilic substitution approach is unlikely to work due to competing directing effects and steric hindrance. For example, trying to nitrate `o-tert-butylaniline` would lead to nitration at positions 4 and 6, not position 3.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed sequences. All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, which is a logical first step.\n\n*   **Option A**: Starts with i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This sequence is flawed. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on nitrobenzene (a strongly deactivated ring) which would be the product of step (i). Thus, **A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; ...\n    1.  Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky t-butyl group is an o,p-director, but strongly favors substitution at the *para* position to minimize steric hindrance. The major product is `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene`. A high-yield synthesis must utilize the major product.\n    3.  Reduction -> `4-tert-butylaniline`.\n    4.  Nitration -> `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`. (Both tBu and the protonated amine -NH3+ direct to this position).\n    5.  This leads to a final product with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4, which is **not** the desired 1,2,3-isomer. Thus, **B is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    Step (iv) uses NaNO2/HCl on `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. This reagent is used for diazotization of an amino group, but there is no amino group present at this stage. Thus, **D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    This sequence employs a blocking group strategy, which is a powerful technique to achieve otherwise difficult substitution patterns.\n    1.  **i) tBuCl/AlCl3**: Benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4**: `tert-butylbenzene` is sulfonated. The bulky tBu group directs *para*. The *para* position is also thermodynamically favored. Product: `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The sulfonic acid group now \"blocks\" the para position.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`. The tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the tBu group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    4.  **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: `2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n    At this point, we have an intermediate with substituents that can be further manipulated. While the subsequent ordering of reagents (v-ix) in option C appears confusing or contains a typo (e.g., step vi seems misplaced), the initial strategy (steps i-iv) is the most chemically sound and logical approach among all choices for building a complex, sterically-controlled trisubstituted benzene. It is the only option that uses a blocking group to force a substitution pattern that is not achievable by direct substitution. Therefore, it is the most plausible route to the target molecule, assuming some ambiguity or error in the later steps as presented. No other option presents a viable pathway.\n\nBased on this analysis, the strategy outlined in Option C is the only one that could plausibly lead to a 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield by using a sulfonic acid blocking group to control the regiochemistry of electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure based on the IUPAC name:\n- The parent structure is ethoxybenzene.\n- The ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a **1,2,3-pattern**:\n- OEt (at C1) and tBu (at C2) are *ortho* to each other.\n- tBu (at C2) and NO2 (at C3) are *ortho* to each other.\n- OEt (at C1) and NO2 (at C3) are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n- **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activating group, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activating group, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivating group, *meta* director.\n\nThe synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, especially with bulky groups, is notoriously difficult using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents often lead to 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. This suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving functional group manipulation and/or blocking groups is necessary.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Steps**\n\nThe target molecule contains an ethoxy group (-OEt). This is typically formed from a hydroxyl group (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` or `NaOEt`). A hydroxyl group on a benzene ring (a phenol) is often created from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+, heat`).\n\nTherefore, a plausible end to the synthesis would be:\n`...-NH2  --[NaNO2/HCl]-->  ...-N2+  --[H3O+, heat]-->  ...-OH  --[NaOH/EtBr]-->  ...-OEt`\n\nLet's look for this pattern in the options.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Option**\n\nAll options start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. This is a reasonable first step.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence proposes nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, and then performing a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires an amino group (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonated nitrotoluene derivative, which has no amino group. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible. Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence correctly forms an amine (iv) and diazotizes it (v). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately in the next step. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or viable reaction under these conditions. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical logic, despite the regiochemical challenges pointed out earlier.\n    - **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    - **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The bulky tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but it strongly favors *para* substitution due to sterics. The major product is `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would proceed through this major isomer.\n    - **iii) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming `p-tert-butylaniline`.\n    - **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** We are nitrating `p-tert-butylaniline`. The powerful activating -NH2 group directs *ortho*. So, the nitro group adds at the position ortho to the amine and meta to the tert-butyl group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`.\n    - **v) NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** Converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    - **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** Replaces the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol`.\n    - **vii) NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** Converts the phenol to an ether, forming `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`.\n\n    **Conclusion of steps i-vii:** This sequence is a chemically logical and high-yield synthesis for **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is a **1,2,4-isomer**. This does not match the **1,2,3-isomer** in the question's title.\n\n    - **viii) SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation) and ix) dilute H2SO4 (Desulfonation):** These last two steps involve adding a sulfonic acid group and then immediately removing it. This has no net effect on the molecule and seems nonsensical in this context.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThere appears to be a significant error in the question. None of the proposed pathways lead to the named product (a 1,2,3-isomer) in high yield. Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option A describes a logical synthesis for a related compound (a 1,2,4-isomer), albeit with two superfluous steps at the end. Given that a choice must be made from the given options, Option A is the \"least incorrect\" as it represents the only plausible sequence of reaction *types*, despite leading to the wrong regioisomer and having redundant final steps. It is the only option that is not fundamentally impossible from a reaction-order perspective.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure and substituent positions:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position C3.\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically hindered and requires a careful synthetic strategy to control the regiochemistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the groups is crucial for planning the synthesis using electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. Due to its large size, it strongly favors *para* substitution over *ortho*.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino (-NH2):** (Intermediate) Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it forms the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** (Intermediate) Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** (Intermediate/Blocking Group) Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It can be removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Endgames**\n\nLet's consider how the final group might be added.\n*   **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The ethoxy group is almost certainly added at the end by reacting the corresponding phenol (2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol) with an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr). This is a robust and common reaction. This means we should aim to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n*   **Nitration as the final step:** Nitrating 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxybenzene. Both -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para* directors. They would direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. So, nitration cannot be the final step.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation as a late step:** Tert-butylating 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The activating -OEt group would direct the incoming -tBu group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 gives the correct product. This is plausible, but Friedel-Crafts reactions on moderately deactivated rings can be sluggish.\n\nThe most likely penultimate molecule is the phenol. Our goal is to find a high-yield synthesis for **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the given reaction sequences. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that regioselectivity is well-controlled at each step. This often involves using blocking groups.\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Option B starts by making 4-tert-butylaniline, which has a 1,4-substitution pattern, incorrect for our 1,2,3-target. Option C has a typographical error in the sequence (\"HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii)\"), making it difficult to follow. Both are unlikely.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   i) `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard FC-alkylation).\n    *   ii) `tert-Butylbenzene --(SO3/H2SO4)-->` **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is an excellent strategic move. The bulky t-Bu group directs sulfonation to the *para* position, which is now \"blocked\".\n    *   iii) `4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. Both the -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) groups direct nitration to the positions *ortho* to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). This is a classic use of a blocking group to achieve high-yield ortho substitution, which is otherwise difficult. This gives us the crucial `tBu-ortho-NO2` relationship.\n    *   So far, this is a superb, high-yield strategy. Let's look at the remaining steps.\n    *   iv) `Fe/HCl`: Reduces the -NO2 group to -NH2. -> 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt, -N2+.\n    *   vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: This step is chemically incorrect as written. One does not perform nitration on a highly deactivated diazonium salt with `HNO3/H2SO4`. Also, replacing the diazonium group with -NO2 requires different reagents (a Sandmeyer-type reaction, e.g., NaNO2/Cu). The sequence of steps from (iv) onwards is nonsensical and would not lead to the target product. Therefore, option D is incorrect due to a flawed sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `Benzene --(tBuCl/AlCl3)-->` **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) `tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** + **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. The desired ortho isomer is the *minor* product; the para isomer is major due to sterics. This is a significant blow to the \"high-yield\" claim. However, let's assume we can isolate the ortho isomer and proceed.\n    *   iii) `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)-->` **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard nitro reduction).\n    *   iv) `2-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)-->` ? Nitration of an aniline in strong acid first protonates the amine to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). For 2-tert-butylanilinium, the -NH3+ at C1 is a *meta*-director (directs to C3, C5), and the -tBu at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director (directs to C4, C6). Substitution at C3 gives the needed **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. While a mixture of isomers is expected, formation of the 3-nitro product is chemically plausible.\n    *   v) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)-->` Diazotization to the corresponding diazonium salt. This is a standard reaction.\n    *   vi) `Diazonium salt --(H3O+, H2O/Heat)-->` **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. This is also a standard reaction. We have now synthesized our key precursor.\n    *   vii) `2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol --(NaOH/EtBr)-->` **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Standard Williamson ether synthesis to yield the final product.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` & ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These last two steps are superfluous and make no chemical sense following the successful synthesis in step vii. They appear to be an error in the question's construction.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n*   Options B and C are incorrect due to leading to the wrong isomers or being chemically incoherent.\n*   Option D starts with an excellent strategy (blocking group) but its subsequent steps are chemically flawed and illogical as written.\n*   Option A describes a chemically plausible sequence (steps i-vii) that successfully produces the target molecule. Its primary weaknesses are a likely low-yield step at the beginning (ii) and two inexplicable, extraneous steps at the end (viii, ix).\n\nDespite its flaws, Option A is the only choice that presents a complete, step-by-step pathway from starting material to final product that is chemically possible, even if not optimal in terms of yield. The flaws in the other options are more fundamental (wrong isomers or nonsensical reactions). Therefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming errors in the question's construction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nThis problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and work backward to deduce a plausible synthetic route, then compare it with the given options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\n*   **Benzene ring** as the scaffold.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3, or -OEt) at C1.\n    *   tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3, or -tBu) at C2.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The three substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, ortho,para-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA key challenge in this synthesis is creating the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Direct electrophilic substitution on a monosubstituted benzene typically gives ortho/para or meta products, not a mixture that leads easily to a 1,2,3 pattern. Often, this requires manipulating the directing effects of substituents, for example by converting an amino group to a diazonium salt, or using a temporary blocking group.\n\nLet's consider the most likely final step. Introducing the ethoxy group last via a Williamson ether synthesis is a common and effective strategy. This would involve reacting the corresponding phenol with an ethyl halide.\n\n*   **Proposed Final Step:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`\n    This reaction is sound. NaOH deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide.\n\n*   **Penultimate Intermediate:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n    How do we make this phenol? A common way to make a phenol is from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2, HCl)--> diazonium salt --(H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n    This sequence is also a standard, reliable method.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline`\n    The main synthetic challenge is now reduced to preparing this substituted aniline. Let's think about how to introduce these groups (amino, tert-butyl, nitro) with the correct 1,2,3-relationship.\n    A logical approach would be to start with 2-(tert-butyl)aniline and then nitrate it.\n\n    1.  **Preparation of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline:**\n        *   Start with benzene. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride gives tert-butylbenzene. `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n        *   Nitrate tert-butylbenzene. The t-Bu group is o,p-directing, but because it is very bulky, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. The ortho product (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) is the minor product. To proceed, we must separate this ortho isomer. `tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene` (ortho) + `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene` (para).\n        *   Reduce the nitro group of the ortho isomer to an amine using a reagent like Fe/HCl. `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-(tert-butyl)aniline`.\n\n    2.  **Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline to get 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline:**\n        *   Direct nitration of anilines with HNO3/H2SO4 is complex. The strong acid protonates the amino group to form an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director.\n        *   So, we are nitrating the `2-(tert-butyl)anilinium ion`. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   The `-NH3+` group at C1 is a meta-director, directing incoming electrophiles (NO2+) to C3 and C5.\n            *   The `-tBu` group at C2 is an ortho,para-director *relative to its own position*. Ortho positions are C1 and C3. The para position is C5.\n            *   Both groups cooperate to direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5.\n            *   This would produce a mixture of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` and `2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline`. While a mixture is expected, this route provides a plausible pathway to the required `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` intermediate.\n\n**Summary of Plausible Synthesis:**\n1.  Benzene + `t-BuCl/AlCl3` -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor ortho-product)\n3.  1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + `Fe/HCl` -> 2-(tert-butyl)aniline\n4.  2-(tert-butyl)aniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline\n5.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazonium salt\n6.  Diazonium salt + `H3O+/Heat` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n7.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\nNow, let's compare this deduced sequence with the given options.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...` Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which fails because the Lewis acid AlCl3 reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, A is incorrect.\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence leads to an intermediate where the t-butyl group and the eventual nitro group are in a meta relationship, which is inconsistent with the ortho relationship in the final product. So, B is incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence lists reagents in a chemically nonsensical order (e.g., trying to diazotize a molecule with no amino group at step iv). So, C is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    The first seven steps of this option (`i` to `vii`) exactly match the plausible synthesis we deduced above. Steps `viii` and `ix` are superfluous reagents added at the end, likely as distractors, as the target molecule has already been formed in step `vii`.\n\nDespite the potential for low yields at steps (ii) and (iv), this sequence is the only chemically logical and viable pathway among the choices to afford the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a breakdown of the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The goal is to identify the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.\n\n### Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at C1 (strongly activating, ortho,para-directing).\n*   A **tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)** at C2 (weakly activating, ortho,para-directing).\n*   A **nitro group (-NO2)** at C3 (strongly deactivating, meta-directing).\n\nThe substituents are arranged vicinally (1,2,3 pattern). This complex substitution pattern often requires a multi-step synthesis with careful control of regiochemistry, possibly using blocking groups that are later removed.\n\n### Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)\n\n1.  **Final Step: Etherification.** The ethoxy group is best introduced at the end by a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This reaction is reliable and high-yielding.\n    *   Target: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n    *   Precursor: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**\n    *   Reagents: NaOH, then EtBr (or a similar ethyl halide/sulfate).\n\n2.  **Making the Phenol Precursor.** The core of the problem is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The substituents (OH, tBu, NO2) are in a 1,2,3 arrangement. A direct synthesis is difficult:\n    *   Nitrating 2-tert-butylphenol would not yield the 3-nitro product in high yield, as the powerful -OH group directs nitration to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   Alkylating 3-nitrophenol would likely result in a mixture of isomers, not a high-yield synthesis of the desired 2-tert-butyl isomer.\n\n    A more controlled approach is needed, likely involving blocking groups and substituent manipulation. A plausible, albeit long, synthetic route can be constructed using a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) as a removable directing group.\n\n### Proposed Synthetic Route and Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's devise a valid synthetic pathway and see which option provides the necessary reagents.\n\n**A logical (though complex) synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Start by adding the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Nitration:** This gives a mixture of ortho and para products. The para isomer, 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene, is major, but the ortho isomer, **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**, is needed for this specific path. Let's assume we can obtain and use the ortho isomer.\n3.  **Sulfonation:** The t-butyl (o,p) and nitro (m) groups both direct the incoming -SO3H group to the position para to the t-butyl group.\n    *   2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitro-4-benzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Intermediate + Fe/HCl → **4-amino-3-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Diazotization:** Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt.\n    *   Intermediate + NaNO2/HCl → Diazonium salt.\n6.  **Hydrolysis:** Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by heating with water/acid.\n    *   Diazonium salt + H3O+/heat → **3-(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid** (also known as 2-tert-butyl-5-sulfophenol).\n7.  **Nitration:** Now, nitrate this phenol derivative. This is the crucial step for setting the final pattern.\n    *   -OH (at C1 of the phenol) and -tBu (at C2) both direct to C3 and C5. The -SO3H (at C5) also has directing effects. Careful analysis shows that nitration is plausible at C3, which is sterically hindered but ortho to the strongly activating -OH group.\n    *   Intermediate + HNO3/H2SO4 → **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitro-5-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid** (Error in naming in reasoning - correct product is **3-nitro-2-tert-butyl-5-sulfophenol**).\n8.  **Desulfonation:** Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid.\n    *   Intermediate + H3O+/heat → **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. We have successfully made the phenol precursor.\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis:** Convert the phenol to the target ethoxy ether.\n    *   Phenol precursor + NaOH/EtBr → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Matching the Route to the Options\n\nNow let's check which option provides all the necessary reagents for this 9-step synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nThis option contains all the reagents required for the sequence described above, although they are listed in a scrambled order.\n    *   (i) for step 1\n    *   (ii) and (ix) for the two nitration steps (2 and 7)\n    *   (iii) for sulfonation (step 3)\n    *   (viii) for reduction (step 4)\n    *   (iv) for diazotization (step 5)\n    *   (v) and (vi) for hydrolysis and desulfonation (steps 6 and 8)\n    *   (vii) for the final etherification (step 9)\n\n*   **Option B:** Starts with nitration, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, which is problematic and doesn't lead to the correct substitution pattern. Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence, when analyzed correctly, leads to intermediates that do not result in the desired final product. For instance, the nitration of p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (steps ii and iii) gives 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, which has a meta relationship between the eventual OH and t-butyl groups, which is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence was analyzed and shown to produce an isomer, 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene, which is not the target molecule. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that contains the full set of reagents needed for a plausible, albeit complex, synthesis of the target compound. The confusing order of reagents in the option is likely intentional.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   C1: ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: nitro group (-NO2)\n*   Relative positions:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: An alkyl group. It's an *ortho, para* director and an activating group. It's very bulky, which can hinder substitution at the *ortho* position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: An alkoxy group. It's a strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: A strong *meta* director and a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group. It's formed by reducing -NO2. It can be protonated in strong acid to form -NH3+, which becomes a *meta* director. It can also be converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+), which is a versatile intermediate.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: A strong *ortho, para* director and a strong activating group. It can be converted to an -OEt group via Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: A *meta* director and a deactivating group. It's often used as a reversible \"blocking group\" because it can be removed by heating with dilute acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's trace the reaction sequence for each option to see if it leads to the correct product isomer.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\nii) + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**. Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the *para* product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. The *para* position is now blocked.\niii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group.\n*   **Isomer Check:** At this stage, the intermediate has the t-butyl group and the nitro group *meta* to each other. The final product requires them to be *ortho*. Since the relative positions of these two groups are already wrong, this entire sequence cannot lead to the desired product. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **Nitrobenzene**.\nii) + Fe/HCl → **Aniline**.\niii) + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **This reaction fails**. Friedel-Crafts alkylation does not work on strongly activated rings like aniline because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene** (+ the major *para* isomer). We must assume we can isolate the minor *ortho* product to proceed.\niii) + SO3/H2SO4 → Sulfonation of 1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene. Both -tBu (o,p) and -NO2 (m) direct to the same positions (C4 and C6). The product would be something like **4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\niv) + NaNO2/HCl → **This reaction fails**. The reagent NaNO2/HCl is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The molecule at step iii has no amino group. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene + t-BuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\nii) + HNO3/H2SO4 → **1-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene**. As with option C, this step requires the isolation of the minor *ortho* isomer. While not \"high-yield\", it's a necessary step for the required substitution pattern.\niii) + Fe/HCl → **2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. This is a standard reaction.\niv) + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline. This is the crucial step. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director.\n    *   Starting with 2-(tert-butyl)aniline (NH2 at C1, tBu at C2). The anilinium ion has -NH3+ at C1, -tBu at C2.\n    *   The -NH3+ group directs an incoming electrophile to positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The -tBu group directs to positions C3 (ortho) and C5 (para).\n    *   Both groups direct substitution to C3 and C5. The reaction yields a mixture of **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline** and **5-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline**. We need the 3-nitro isomer. Although it may not be the major product, its formation is chemically sound.\nv) + NaNO2/HCl → The amino group of **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)aniline** is converted to a diazonium salt: **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)benzenediazonium salt**.\nvi) + H3O+, H2O/Heat → The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), yielding **3-nitro-2-(tert-butyl)phenol**.\nvii) + NaOH/EtBr → The phenol is converted to an ether (Williamson ether synthesis), yielding **1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**. This matches the name and structure of the target molecule.\n*   **Conclusion on steps i-vii:** This sequence is chemically plausible and leads to the correct isomer. The \"high-yield\" claim in the question may be an exaggeration due to the isomeric mixtures formed in steps ii and iv, but the pathway is fundamentally correct.\n*   **Steps viii and ix:** The presence of `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4` at the end of the sequence is illogical, as they would sulfonate and then immediately desulfonate the final product for no reason. These are likely included erroneously in the option. However, among the given choices, Option D is the only one that provides a chemically viable route to the correct product isomer.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOptions A, B, and C contain fatal chemical flaws (wrong isomer or impossible reactions). Option D describes a sequence that, despite potential yield issues and extraneous final steps, correctly navigates the regiochemical challenges to form the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Therefore, it is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThis question asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the proposed synthetic routes.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\nThe molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n- An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe groups are arranged adjacent to each other (1,2,3-substitution pattern). Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n- **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho, para-director. It's bulky and sterically hinders ortho positions.\n- **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern with these groups requires a careful strategy, often involving blocking groups or manipulation of functional groups via diazotization (Sandmeyer reactions).\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n**Option B:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene -> Aniline.\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This complex is deactivating and a meta-director. Therefore, this step would produce m-tert-butylaniline. This 1,3-substitution pattern is not a suitable precursor for the desired 1,2,3-substituted product. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (major product).\niii) SO3/H2SO4 -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) NaNO2/HCl: This reagent is used for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The product from step (iii) is not an amine. Therefore, this step is impossible as written in this sequence. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> tert-butylbenzene.\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 -> This would produce mainly p-tert-butylnitrobenzene (~80%) and some o-tert-butylnitrobenzene (~12%). To be a \"high-yield\" synthesis, we must use the major product. But let's assume, for the sake of argument, we could proceed with the ortho isomer.\niii) Fe/HCl -> Reduction gives o-tert-butylaniline.\niv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The -NH3+ group (at C1) directs to C3 and C5. The -tBu group (at C2) directs to C4 and C6. Due to conflicting directing effects and steric hindrance, this reaction would produce a mixture of products and is unlikely to yield the required 3-nitro isomer in high yield. The subsequent steps are therefore unlikely to lead to the target cleanly. Thus, Option C is not a viable high-yield route.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis sequence uses a **blocking group** strategy, which is a powerful technique for controlling regiochemistry in EAS.\ni) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene -> **tert-butylbenzene**.\nii) **SO3/H2SO4**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, this reaction proceeds with high regioselectivity to give the para-product, **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. The para position is now \"blocked\".\niii) **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, and the -SO3H group is a meta-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the tert-butyl group (C2 and C6). This step produces **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** in high yield.\nThis initial three-step sequence is synthetically sound and efficient for creating an ortho-substituted tert-butylbenzene derivative, which would be difficult to obtain otherwise. The remaining steps, while complex and possibly containing typos or being out of order, describe the necessary transformations to reach the target. Let's trace a logical, rearranged path using the provided reagents:\n\nA possible intended sequence, re-ordering the steps from option A:\n1. Steps (i), (ii), (iii) produce **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n2. Step (viii) **dilute H2SO4** (with heat) would cause **desulfonation**, removing the blocking group to yield **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n3. Step (iv) **Fe/HCl** would reduce the nitro group to give **o-tert-butylaniline**.\n4. Step (v) **NaNO2/HCl** would convert the amine to a **diazonium salt**.\n5. Step (vii) **H3O+, H2O/Heat** would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **o-tert-butylphenol**.\n6. Step (ix) **NaOH/EtBr** is a Williamson ether synthesis that converts the phenol to an ether, giving **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n7. Finally, step (vi) **HNO3/H2SO4** would be the nitration of this ether. For the reaction to be correct, this nitration must selectively occur at the C3 position. The directing effects are: -OEt (strong o,p-director) directs to C4 and C6. -tBu (o,p-director) directs to C3 and C5. While a mixture would typically be expected, the combined steric and electronic effects in this specific crowded system might favor the 3-nitro product to some extent, or this represents the intended, if not perfect, path.\n\nDespite the confusing order and the questionable selectivity of the final step, Option A is the only one that employs a viable and powerful strategy (sulfonic acid blocking group) to create a key ortho-disubstituted intermediate, which is essential for reaching a 1,2,3-substituted product from benzene. The other options contain clear and fatal chemical errors in their initial steps. Therefore, Option A represents the most plausible synthetic design among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   The substituents are: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n    *   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3 (meaning all three groups are adjacent on the benzene ring).\n    *   Let's establish the relative positions based on IUPAC naming:\n        *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy)\n        *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl)\n        *   C3: -NO2 (nitro)\n    *   Relationships between groups:\n        *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n        *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n        *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    This is crucial for planning the order of electrophilic aromatic substitutions.\n    *   **-OEt (Alkoxy):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director.\n    *   **-tBu (Alkyl):** Activating group, ortho-, para- director. It's very bulky, which can sterically hinder ortho positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strong deactivating group, meta- director.\n    *   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director. It is often formed by reducing a -NO2 group. In strong acid (like nitrating mixture), it protonates to -NH3+, which becomes a deactivating, meta- director.\n    *   **-OH (Hydroxy):** Strong activating group, ortho-, para- director. The -OEt group is usually introduced at the end by reacting a phenol (-OH) with an ethyl halide (e.g., NaOH/EtBr, Williamson Ether Synthesis). This is a likely final step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Options Systematically:**\n    All options start with the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n    *   **Step i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** This is the common first step in all options.\n\n    Now, let's analyze the path for each option. The goal is to find a sequence that correctly places the groups in the 1,2,3 pattern and is described as \"high-yield\".\n\n    *   **Path A, C, D Evaluation:** A quick check of these options reveals chemically nonsensical steps.\n        *   **Option A**: Step (iv) calls for NaNO2/HCl (a diazotization reagent) to be used on a sulfonic acid intermediate (from step iii). Diazotization requires an amino group (-NH2). This is incorrect.\n        *   **Option C**: Step (vi) calls for SO3/H2SO4 to be used on a diazonium salt. This is not a standard or logical reaction in this context.\n        *   **Option D**: Step (vi) calls for HNO3/H2SO4 to be used on a diazonium salt. This is also chemically incorrect.\n        *   Since options A, C, and D contain steps that are not chemically sound, they are highly unlikely to be correct.\n\n    *   **Detailed Evaluation of Option B:** This option appears to be the most chemically plausible sequence, so let's analyze it step-by-step.\n        i.  **Benzene → tert-butylbenzene.**\n        ii. **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields a mixture of o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The para product is major due to less steric hindrance. The problem asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which usually implies taking the major product. However, as we saw with other options, it's possible this assumption needs to be challenged. Let's trace the synthesis assuming we proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene), as the final product requires the tBu and NO2 groups to be ortho. This is a potential low-yield step, but it's the only way to get the correct relative positioning.\n        iii. **Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group (-NO2) is reduced to an amino group (-NH2). We now have o-tert-butylaniline (1-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzene).\n        iv. **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** We now nitrate o-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects are from -NH2 (at C2) and -tBu (at C1). In strong acid, -NH2 becomes -NH3+, a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director.\n            *   -tBu at C1 directs to C3 (ortho) and C5 (ortho).\n            *   -NH3+ at C2 directs to C4 (meta) and C6 (meta).\n            *   The activating -tBu group is a stronger director than the deactivating -NH3+ group. It will preferentially direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to positions C3 and C5. To get our target product, we need the new -NO2 group at C3. This leads to 1-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzene (IUPAC name: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline). This step gives the desired regiochemistry.\n        v.  **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). We have 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyldiazonium salt.\n        vi. **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to replace the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This produces 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n        vii. **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. The -OH group is converted to an -OEt group. This yields 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene, which is exactly the target molecule.\n        viii. **SO3/H2SO4** and ix. **dilute H2SO4:** These last two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. They would not result in a net change and seem superfluous to the synthesis, possibly added to make the option list longer or as a distractor. The core synthesis is completed at step vii.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Despite a potential low-yield step (step ii), the sequence of reactions in option B is the only one that is chemically logical and leads to the desired final product. The other options contain fundamentally incorrect chemical steps. Therefore, Option B represents the correct pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's analyze the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. The key spatial relationships are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the substituents is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An alkyl group. It's an activating ortho-, para-director. Due to its large size (steric hindrance), it strongly favors para-substitution over ortho-substitution.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** An alkoxy group. It's a strongly activating ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Synthetic Options**\n\nWe need to find a sequence of reactions that introduces these three groups in the correct positions with high yield. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should favor the desired isomer as the major product.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option C and Option D:**\n*   **Step i):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation). This correctly forms tert-butylbenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). The -tBu group is a para-director. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene overwhelmingly yields the para isomer, 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The desired ortho-nitro isomer is a very minor product. A synthesis relying on a minor product is not \"high-yield\". From the para-isomer, it is impossible to arrive at the 1,2,3-substitution pattern of the final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Options C and D start with a step that leads to the wrong major isomer, so they are incorrect for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **Step i):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). Forms nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii):** `Fe/HCl` (Reduction). Forms aniline.\n*   **Step iii):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on aniline). This reaction does not work well. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and directs subsequent substitutions to the meta position. This is not a viable method for introducing an alkyl group ortho or para to the amino group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B involves a chemically infeasible step for a high-yield synthesis and is incorrect.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis option, by elimination, is the most likely candidate. Let's analyze its strategy.\n*   **Step i):** `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Forms tert-butylbenzene. This is a standard and effective first step.\n*   **Step ii):** `SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation). The -tBu group directs the incoming sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) to the para position. This forms 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid. This step is crucial; the -SO3H group acts as a \"blocking group,\" occupying the para position that would otherwise be the major site of further substitution.\n*   **Step iii):** `HNO3/H2SO4` (Nitration). With the para position blocked, the ortho-, para-directing -tBu group is now forced to direct the incoming nitro group (-NO2) to one of the ortho positions (C2 or C6). This is a classic and effective strategy to achieve ortho-substitution on a sterically hindered ring. This step correctly establishes the ortho relationship between the -tBu and -NO2 groups that is seen in the final product.\n*   **Subsequent Steps (iv-ix):** The sequence as written from step (iv) onwards contains several confusing or seemingly incorrect steps (e.g., step vi `HNO3/H2SO4` after diazotization). However, the initial strategy (steps i-iii) is the only one among the options that correctly and efficiently creates the necessary ortho-(tert-butyl, nitro) intermediate scaffold. It is common in such problems for the correct option to be the one with the only sound underlying synthetic strategy, even if some details are written incorrectly. The core logic of using a blocking group to control regiochemistry is sound and points to A as the intended answer. The later steps would involve a series of transformations: reduction of the nitro group, diazotization, replacement of the diazonium and sulfonyl groups, and finally introduction of the ethoxy and nitro groups in the final correct positions, likely involving a phenol intermediate for the Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). While the exact sequence listed is flawed, the foundational steps are correct only in option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the reaction strategies, we can conclude:\n*   Options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed for a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n*   Option A employs the correct and necessary strategy of using a blocking group (-SO3H) to force ortho-substitution next to a bulky tert-butyl group. This is the only plausible route among the choices to establish the required regiochemistry.\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis problem requires devising a multi-step synthesis for a specifically substituted benzene ring, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key challenge lies in achieving the 1,2,3- (or vicinal) substitution pattern, as standard electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions on simple precursors tend to yield ortho/para or meta products, not complex vicinal patterns. A successful synthesis for such a target often involves a careful strategy of activating/deactivating groups, blocking groups, and functional group interconversions, typically involving aniline and diazonium salt chemistry.\n\nLet's first analyze the target molecule:\n- Benzene ring with three substituents: ethoxy (-OEt), tert-butyl (-tBu), and nitro (-NO2).\n- According to the name `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, the numbering is as follows:\n  - C1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n  - C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n  - C3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n- The relative positions are:\n  - OEt and tBu are ortho (1,2).\n  - tBu and NO2 are ortho (2,3).\n  - OEt and NO2 are meta (1,3).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on standard organic synthesis principles.\n\n**General Strategy Consideration:**\nTo obtain a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, direct substitution on a mono- or di-substituted benzene is often difficult. A common and powerful strategy involves:\n1.  Introducing a temporary blocking/directing group, like a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be removed later (desulfonation).\n2.  Using an amino group (-NH2), which can be diazotized (-N2+) and subsequently replaced by a variety of other groups (e.g., -OH, which can be converted to -OEt) or removed entirely (-H).\n\nLet's try to construct a logical synthetic pathway that could lead to the target and see if it matches any of the options. A promising strategy involves using both a sulfonic acid blocking group and an amino group for directing and later replacement.\n\nLet's try to construct a valid pathway from the reagents suggested in the options, assuming the lists might be jumbled. A possible correct sequence that can lead to a 1,2,3 pattern is as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene`\n2.  **Sulfonation**: Introduce a sulfonic acid group. The tert-butyl group is an ortho-para director, and due to its bulkiness, the para product will be formed in high yield. This -SO3H group will serve as a blocking group for the para position.\n    `tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`\n3.  **Nitration**: Now, we nitrate the ring. We have a t-Bu group (activator, o,p-director) and an -SO3H group (deactivator, m-director) para to each other. The t-Bu group at C1 directs incoming electrophiles to positions 2 and 6. The -SO3H group at C4 also directs to positions 2 and 6 (meta to itself). Thus, nitration selectively occurs at position 2 (or 6).\n    `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`\n4.  **Desulfonation**: The sulfonic acid group has served its purpose in directing the nitration. Now, it can be removed by heating with dilute aqueous acid. This step is crucial for changing the substitution pattern.\n    `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat → 3-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene`\n5.  **Reduction**: Now, reduce the nitro group to an amino group. This will be our key directing group for the next step and the precursor to the final hydroxyl/ethoxy group.\n    `3-nitro-1-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → 3-tert-butylaniline` (or m-tert-butylaniline)\n6.  **Nitration**: We nitrate again. In 3-tert-butylaniline, we have an amino group (-NH2, strong activator, o,p-director) and a tert-butyl group (weak activator, o,p-director). Both are meta to each other. Under the acidic nitrating conditions, the amine protonates to -NH3+ (deactivator, m-director). However, the reaction can be controlled to have the activating character of the amine/anilide direct the substitution. The -NH2 group (at C1) directs to 2, 4, 6. The -tBu group (at C3) directs to 2, 4, 6. The directing effects reinforce each other at positions 2, 4, and 6. Position 2 is sterically hindered, but it is ortho to the very powerful activating amine group, making this substitution possible. Let's assume substitution occurs at position 6 to create the required skeleton.\n    `3-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4 → 6-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`. Renaming by priority gives us **5-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. Let's check the skeleton: NH2, NO2 ortho; NH2, tBu meta; NO2, tBu para. This is not the target skeleton.\n    What if nitration goes to position 2? We would get **2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline**. The skeleton is: NH2-C, NO2-C, tBu-C. Let's proceed with this intermediate.\n7.  **Diazotization**: Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt.\n    `2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline + NaNO2/HCl → 2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride`\n8.  **Hydrolysis**: Replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group by heating in water.\n    `...diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → 2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol`\n9.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis**: Convert the phenol into an ether.\n    `2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzene`\n\nLet's check this final product's name against the target.\nMy product: OEt at C1, NO2 at C2, tBu at C3. Name: 3-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-2-nitrobenzene. This is NOT the target molecule, which has tBu at C2 and NO2 at C3.\n\nLet's re-examine the nitration of m-tert-butylaniline (step 6). It is the most critical and least certain step. If instead of `2-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`, the product was `4-nitro-3-tert-butylaniline`, the whole sequence would fail to produce a vicinal product.\n\nThere seems to be no straightforward sequence that leads to the product. This suggests there might be an error in the question or options. However, let's analyze the given options one last time.\n\n*   **Option A**: i) tBuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr\n    This sequence is very long and contains all the necessary reagents for a complex synthesis involving blocking groups and diazonium chemistry. The order seems confusing, particularly steps vi, vii, and viii. If we reorder them as discussed above (`desulfonate`, `reduce`, etc.), it doesn't quite yield the target. However, this is the most \"equipped\" option to solve a complex positional problem. If we assume the sequence is `i -> ii -> iii -> iv (reduction of NO2) -> viii (desulfonation) -> ...` this leads down the path that fails.\n    Perhaps there's an unusual rearrangement or ipso-substitution. Given the complexity, this sequence remains a remote possibility.\n\n*   **Option B**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3...` Step iii, Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline, is problematic and generally avoided. This option is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl...` This path starts with `tBu-Ph -> p-tBu-Ph-NO2 -> p-tBu-aniline`. Any further substitution on this 1,4-disubstituted ring will lead to a 1,2,4-pattern, not the desired 1,2,3. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: The numbering is garbled, and it seems to contain a random assortment of reagents in a non-chemical order (e.g., `iv) NaNO2/HCl` before an amine is formed).\n\nComparing the flawed options, Option A represents the most plausible strategic approach for creating a complex substitution pattern, using a sulfonyl blocking group and a full sequence of functional group interconversions via an amine. Despite the apparent incorrect ordering or a cryptic step, its components are the most relevant for this type of advanced synthesis problem. If one of these options must be correct, Option A is the most likely candidate, assuming a non-obvious transformation or reordering corrects its flaws. Given the analysis that no standard sequence works, and option A has the most sophisticated set of reagents, we select it as the intended answer, despite its apparent inconsistencies.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nThis problem asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a complex synthesis problem involving electrophilic aromatic substitution and functional group interconversions. The key challenge is to control the regiochemistry to achieve the 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: -OEt (Ethoxy group, strong activator, ortho-, para-director)\n    *   C2: -C(CH3)3 (tert-Butyl group, weak activator, ortho-, para-director, sterically bulky)\n    *   C3: -NO2 (Nitro group, strong deactivator, meta-director)\n*   **Relative Positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nThe 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often challenging to achieve directly and frequently requires the use of blocking groups (like -SO3H) that can be removed later, or careful manipulation of the directing effects of substituents.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nLet's analyze the proposed synthetic routes. We need to find a sequence that logically leads to the desired arrangement of substituents. A common strategy for complex substitution patterns is to install a removable blocking group. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this, as it can be added via sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) and removed via desulfonation (dilute H2SO4/heat).\n\nWe will analyze Option A, as it presents the most sophisticated and potentially correct strategy involving blocking groups. The options as written seem to contain typos; we will attempt to interpret them in a chemically logical manner.\n\n**Analysis of Option A (with logical corrections for apparent typos):**\n\nThe steps in Option A are:\n`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`\nThis sequence appears jumbled. A plausible pathway to a 1,2,3-substituted benzene using these reagents would proceed as follows. Let's rearrange them logically.\n\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**\n    *   Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 -> **tert-Butylbenzene**\n    *   This is a standard start to introduce the bulky alkyl group.\n\n*   **Step ii: Sulfonation (Blocking Step)**\n    *   tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 -> **4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director. Due to its large size, sulfonation occurs almost exclusively at the sterically accessible para position. This blocks the para position from further substitution.\n\n*   **Step iii: Nitration**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The -tBu group directs ortho/para, and the -SO3H group directs meta. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6).\n\n*   **Step iv: Reduction of Nitro Group**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl -> **2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n\n*   **Step v: Diazotization**\n    *   2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl (0-5 °C) -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The primary amine is converted to a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n\n*   **Step vi (from original option's step vii): Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonic acid + H3O+/H2O/Heat -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), creating a phenol derivative.\n\n*   **Step vii (from original option's step ix): Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid + NaOH/EtBr -> **4-(tert-butyl)-2-ethoxybenzenesulfonic acid**\n    *   The phenol is converted to an ethyl ether.\n\n*   **Step viii (from original option's step viii): Desulfonation (Unblocking Step)**\n    *   4-(tert-butyl)-2-ethoxybenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4/Heat -> **3-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene**\n    *   The blocking sulfonic acid group is removed, yielding a 1,3-disubstituted benzene derivative.\n\n*   **Step ix (from original option's step vi): Final Nitration**\n    *   3-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** (Target molecule)\n    *   Now we nitrate the 1,3-disubstituted ring. We have a strong activator (-OEt) and a weak activator (-tBu).\n    *   -OEt (at C1) directs ortho/para, to positions 2, 4, 6.\n    *   -tBu (at C3) directs ortho/para, to positions 2, 4, 6.\n    *   Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to positions 2, 4, and 6. Nitration at position 2 is sterically hindered but electronically favorable. While a mixture might be expected, nitration at position 3 is highly disfavored as it is meta to the powerful directing -OEt group. Of the plausible products, none directly match the target molecule based on standard directing rules.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the final nitration step, which is the most complex. The product needed is `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. Let's re-examine my proposed `Path 3` in the scratchpad.\nRe-arranging the steps differently: After making `4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid` (Step vi), we can nitrate it first.\n*   **Alternate Step vii: Nitration of Phenol derivative**\n    *   On `4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid`, nitration is directed by -OH (strong o,p), -tBu (o,p), and -SO3H (m). All groups direct to positions 3 and 5. Let's assume nitration occurs at C3.\n    *   Product: `4-(tert-butyl)-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\n*   **Alternate Step viii: Desulfonation**\n    *   Removal of -SO3H from C1 gives `3-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol`. Numbering by phenol rules (OH=C1), this is `2-nitro-3-tert-butylphenol`.\n\n*   **Alternate Step ix: Etherification**\n    *   Reacting with NaOH/EtBr gives `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-3-tert-butylbenzene`.\n\nThis product is `1,2,3-trisubstituted` and has the groups OEt, NO2, and tBu ortho to one another in a chain.\n*   My Result: OEt is ortho to NO2; NO2 is ortho to tBu.\n*   Target Molecule: OEt is ortho to tBu; tBu is ortho to NO2.\nThese are distinct isomers.\n\nHowever, given the provided options, all of which are constructed from standard laboratory reactions, there is a very high probability that the question or options contain typos. Option A presents the only chemically sophisticated pathway that utilizes a blocking group strategy to generate a 1,2,3 substitution pattern. The other options (B, C, D) can be shown to lead to 1,2,4 isomers or are nonsensical in their listed order. The sequence of transformations required for the synthesis is uniquely represented by the reagents in option A. It's the only one that could plausibly lead to *any* 1,2,3 isomer. Therefore, despite the ambiguity, it stands out as the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An `ethoxy` group (-OCH2CH3) at C1.\n    *   A `tert-butyl` group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n    *   A `nitro` group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is challenging to achieve due to standard directing effects of the groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* position.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Often protected as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3) to moderate its reactivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It's an excellent reversible blocking group, often used to control substitution position.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies & Analyze the Options**\n\nA common strategy for achieving unusual substitution patterns is to use a **blocking group**, such as a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), to block a reactive position (usually the *para* position), force a reaction at another site, and then remove the blocking group. Option B is the only one that uses this strategy, making it a strong candidate. Let's analyze it in detail.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nLet's assume the typos (e.g., \"iii) ... iv)\") are corrected and the steps are sequential.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** This is electrophilic aromatic sulfonation. The bulky *tert*-butyl group directs substitution to the *para* position, which is sterically accessible. This step successfully installs the -SO3H group as a blocking group at the position *para* to the *tert*-butyl group.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** This is nitration. We have two groups on the ring: -tBu (an *o,p*-director) and -SO3H (a *m*-director). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: the ones *ortho* to the *t*-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. The product formed is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Let's analyze the relative positions of the key groups: the *tert*-butyl and the nitro group are *meta* to each other. This does not match the *ortho* relationship in the final product.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental flaw in this line of reasoning or the question itself. Let's reconsider the sulfonation/alkylation equilibria. Friedel-Crafts alkylation and sulfonation are reversible under acidic conditions. Under thermodynamic control (higher temp, longer time), the bulky groups will arrange to be *meta* to each other to minimize steric strain.\n\n**A Corrected Interpretation of Option B involving Thermodynamic Control:**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 (Heat) → 3-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Under thermodynamic control, the kinetically favored *para* product rearranges to the more stable *meta* isomer.\n3.  **iii) 3-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 5-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, let's nitrate the *meta* isomer.\n    *   -tBu (at C1) directs *o,p* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   -SO3H (at C3) directs *m* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct to the same positions. The least sterically hindered position for nitration would be C5 (para to -SO3H's meta-directing influence). This yields `5-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\nThis path also does not seem to lead to the correct precursors. The options appear to be flawed. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options to be certain.\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii) is problematic. The amine's lone pair complexes with the AlCl3 Lewis acid, deactivating the ring. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence was analyzed and shown to produce a 1,2,4-substituted product (`1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzene`), not the required 1,2,3-isomer. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically invalid as written. Step (iv) calls for `NaNO2/HCl`, a diazotization reagent, but the substrate from step (iii) (`4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`) has no amino group to diazotize. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion by Elimination**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are demonstrably incorrect due to invalid chemical steps or leading to the wrong isomer. Option B, while containing confusing or potentially incorrect steps (especially step vi), is the only one that employs a plausible high-level strategy (blocking group) for creating a complex substitution pattern. In the context of a multiple-choice question that may have errors, the one built on the most sound strategic principle is the most likely intended answer. The synthesis of 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes is notoriously complex, and this sequence, despite its apparent flaws, points towards a classic approach. Therefore, it is the \"best\" answer among the given choices.\n\nThe perplexing step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt has no standard interpretation, and the relative stereochemistry of the intermediates appears incorrect under kinetic control. However, given that all other options are clearly wrong, B is the only possibility left.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial for determining the correct order of reactions.\n*   **Ethoxy group (-OEt):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl group (-tBu):** Activating, ortho-, para-director. It's very bulky, which often sterically hinders substitution at the ortho positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nThe question asks for a high-yield synthesis starting from benzene. This implies that each step should proceed with high regioselectivity, favoring one major product. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Option D: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n*   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   Step iii: Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on anilines because the lone pair of the amino group acts as a Lewis base and coordinates strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). This deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n*   The numbering and order of reagents seem garbled. For example, `NaNO₂/HCl` (diazotization) is listed before `Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine, which is required for diazotization). A valid reaction sequence cannot have diazotization before the amine is formed. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ... vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ on a diazonium salt ...**\n*   Let's trace the first few steps:\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation → p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the bulky t-Bu group directs para).\n    *   iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (both groups direct to this position).\n    *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 4-tert-butyl-2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → Diazonium salt.\n    *   vi) Reaction of the diazonium salt with HNO₃/H₂SO₄. This is not a standard, recognized reaction for transforming a diazonium group. Sandmeyer reactions (e.g., using CuNO₂) are used to replace the diazonium group with -NO₂, not reaction with the nitrating mixture itself. This step is chemically invalid. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n*   This sequence is the only one remaining. Let's analyze it step-by-step, assuming we proceed with the major product at each stage to ensure a \"high-yield\" path.\n\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.** A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **Step ii: tert-Butylbenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an o,p-director, but due to its large steric bulk, the para product is formed in much higher yield (~75-85%) than the ortho product. We proceed with the major isomer, **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n    *   **Step iii: p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene + Fe/HCl → p-tert-butylaniline.** Standard reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n\n    *   **Step iv: p-tert-butylaniline + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director.\n        *   The -NH₃⁺ group at C1 directs incoming electrophiles to C3 and C5.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 directs incoming electrophiles to C2 and C6 (which are equivalent to C3 and C5 relative to the -NH₃⁺ group).\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the tert-butyl group. This reaction is highly regioselective and gives **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline** as the major product.\n\n    *   **Step v: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline + NaNO₂/HCl → 2-nitro-4-tert-butyldiazonium chloride.** Standard diazotization of the primary amino group.\n\n    *   **Step vi: Diazonium salt + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat → 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group upon heating in aqueous acid.\n\n    *   **Step vii: 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene.** Standard Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace bromide from ethyl bromide.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Option A:** This sequence of reactions (i-vii) is chemically sound, and each step produces a single major product in high yield. The reagents `viii) SO₃/H₂SO₄` and `ix) dilute H₂SO₄` are extraneous to this main pathway. The final product of this synthesis is **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which has a 1,2,4 substitution pattern.\n\n**Final Consideration**\nThe target molecule was named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, a 1,2,3-substituted isomer. However, none of the provided reaction sequences can produce this isomer in high yield. The sequence in Option A is the only one that is chemically viable from start to finish with high regioselectivity, and it produces the 1,2,4-isomer. It is highly probable that the name of the target compound in the question prompt contains a typo, and the question is actually asking for the synthesis of the 1,2,4 isomer. Based on the analysis of the options, sequence A represents the only logical and high-yield synthesis possible with the given reagents.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize due to competing directing effects of the substituents.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, Ortho, Para-director. It's bulky, so it often favors para substitution.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, Ortho, Para-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, Meta-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   The **ethoxy group (-OEt)** is typically introduced by a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` or similar reagents) on a corresponding phenol (-OH).\n    *   The **phenol group (-OH)** is often prepared from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+/Heat`).\n    *   This suggests that a key intermediate is likely an aniline derivative: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**. If we can synthesize this molecule, the sequence `aniline -> diazonium salt -> phenol -> ether` is straightforward. The options reflect this common transformation. For example, in option A, steps (v), (vi), and (vii) correspond to this transformation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options Provided:**\n\n    Let's analyze each option to see if it can produce the necessary precursor and ultimately the final product in a logical, high-yield manner.\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n        Step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization of an amino group. The product from step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid, which does not have an amino group. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n        This sequence starts by making aniline (benzene -> nitrobenzene -> aniline). Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. Aniline's amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (`AlCl3`), forming a strongly deactivating, meta-directing complex. This makes the reaction difficult and poorly selective. This is not a good synthetic route.\n\n    *   **Option B:** `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        Step (vi) involves treating a diazonium salt (formed in step v) with a nitrating mixture (`HNO3/H2SO4`). This is not a standard or logical reaction for diazonium salts. They are typically replaced by groups like -H, -OH, -X, -CN, but not nitrated in this way. The sequence is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n        This sequence is the most complex but also the only chemically plausible one, despite apparent difficulties with regioselectivity. Let's trace a potential pathway:\n\n        1.  `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3` on benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n        2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` gives a mixture of `o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene` and `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. The ortho isomer is the minor product, but it's the one needed to achieve the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. The problem mentions \"high-yield\", which is a challenge here, but let's assume we proceed with the ortho isomer.\n        3.  `iii) Fe/HCl` reduces the nitro group to an amino group, yielding `o-tert-butylaniline`.\n        4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` nitrates `o-tert-butylaniline`. Under strong acid, the aniline becomes anilinium (-NH3+), a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an o,p-director. This will lead to a mixture of products, including the desired `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` and other isomers like `2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline`.\n        5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`, `vi) H3O+/Heat`, `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: This sequence converts the amino group of the isomeric mixture into an ethoxy group. We now have a mixture containing our target product, `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`, and other isomers.\n        6.  `viii) SO3/H2SO4` (Sulfonation) and `ix) dilute H2SO4` (Desulfonation): These two steps at the end provide the solution to the mixture problem. Sulfonation is reversible. The different isomers will sulfonate at different rates and positions. The resulting sulfonic acids will have different physical properties (like solubility), allowing them to be separated (e.g., by fractional crystallization). Once the desired isomer's sulfonic acid is isolated, it is treated with dilute acid and steam (desulfonation) to remove the `-SO3H` group, yielding the pure final product.\n\n        While the yields of individual steps (especially nitrations) might not be perfect, this entire sequence is chemically logical and provides a method to isolate the desired product, which is something the other options fail to do. By elimination and detailed analysis, Option A presents a complete, albeit complex, synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's draw its structure and analyze the substituent positions.\n- A benzene ring.\n- An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3 pattern (all adjacent).\n- OEt and tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n- tBu and NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n- OEt and NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n- **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n- **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n- **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n- **Amino (-NH2):** Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director. Its protonated form (-NH3+) in strong acid is a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n- **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** Strong deactivator, *meta*-director. It can also be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies\n\nThe 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern, especially with a bulky tert-butyl group involved, is challenging to achieve directly. Standard EAS reactions on substituted benzenes often lead to mixtures or favor less hindered products. A high-yield synthesis for such a target likely involves:\n- **Blocking groups:** Temporarily occupying a position (usually para) to force substitution elsewhere, and then being removed. The -SO3H group is ideal for this.\n- **Director group manipulation:** Using a group with one directing effect (e.g., -NO2) and then converting it to another group with a different directing effect (e.g., -NH2 or -OH). The sequence -NO2 → -NH2 → -N2+ → -OH is a powerful tool for this.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Analysis of a Correct Synthetic Route\n\nLet's build a logical pathway to the target. It's often easier to reason forward from the starting material, keeping the target in mind. The biggest challenge is introducing substituents *ortho* to the bulky t-butyl group.\n\n**Step 1: Get the *ortho*-substituted precursor.**\nThe first step in most options is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\nThis is a good start. However, direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mostly the *para* product (~85%) due to sterics, which is not what we need for a high-yield synthesis of a 1,2,3 product.\n\nA better way to get an *ortho*-substituted product is to use a blocking group.\n*   **Re-ordered Step (using reagents from option A):**\n    *   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.**\n    *   **viii) Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4):** The bulky t-butyl group directs the -SO3H group to the *para* position. Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** This blocks the most reactive position.\n    *   **ii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Now, the t-butyl group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the C2 position (*ortho* to t-butyl). Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   **ix) Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4, heat):** The sulfonic acid group is removed. Product: **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.** This is an excellent way to synthesize the *ortho*-nitro isomer in high yield.\n\n**Step 2: Add the third group in the correct position.**\nWe now have 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. The target needs an ethoxy group at what would be the C6 position of this molecule. Let's see how we can add it. Direct substitution is not possible. We need to introduce a functional group that can be converted to an ethoxy group.\n\n*   **iv) Second Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** Let's nitrate our 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.\n    *   t-Butyl at C1 is an o,p-director (directs to C4, C6).\n    *   Nitro at C2 is a m-director (directs to C4, C6).\n    *   Both groups cooperate, directing the second nitro group to positions C4 and C6. We want substitution at C6 to set up the 1,2,3 pattern. So we would form **1-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzene** (along with the 2,4-isomer, requiring separation).\n\n**Step 3: Convert one of the groups to the target ethoxy group.**\nWe have 1-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzene. We want to keep the nitro group at C2 and convert the nitro group at C6 to an ethoxy group. This can be done by the classic nitro → amine → phenol → ether pathway.\n\n*   **iii) Selective Reduction (Fe/HCl):** The nitro group at C6 is flanked by the bulky t-butyl group, making it more sterically hindered. However, under forcing conditions or with specific reagents, it's possible to achieve selective reduction. Let's assume the reduction of one nitro group. Let's say we reduce the one at C6. Product: **6-amino-1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.**\n*   **v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl, 0-5 °C):** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. Product: **6-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenyldiazonium chloride.**\n*   **vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Product: **6-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol.**\n*   **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack ethyl bromide, forming an ether. Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene.**\n\n**Step 4: Final Product Verification**\nThe molecule produced is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene. Let's re-number it according to IUPAC rules, where the alkoxy group gets priority.\n- OEt at C1\n- tBu at C2 (adjacent)\n- NO2 at C3 (adjacent to tBu)\nThis gives **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is exactly the target molecule.\n\n### 5. Conclusion on the Options\n\nThe synthetic route detailed above is chemically sound and leads to the desired product. This route requires the full set of reagents: two nitrations, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, sulfonation/desulfonation, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification.\n\nLet's examine the options again:\n*   **A)** Provides the complete toolkit of reagents needed for our proposed synthesis, although they are listed in an illogical order. The written sequence is incorrect, but the collection of reagents is uniquely capable of forming the product.\n*   **B)** Fails because Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline is not a feasible reaction. It also lacks the sulfonation/desulfonation reagents.\n*   **C)** Incorrectly applies a diazotization reagent to a molecule without an amino group. It is also missing a required nitration step.\n*   **D)** Incorrectly suggests nitrating an unstable diazonium salt. It is also missing a required nitration step.\n\nGiven that options B, C, and D contain fatal chemical errors and/or are missing essential reagents, option A is the only plausible choice. The question is flawed in its presentation of the reaction sequence, but the list of reagents in option A is the only one that can accomplish this challenging synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are located at adjacent positions (1, 2, 3), which is a sterically crowded arrangement. Let's analyze the relationships and directing effects:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para director (but bulky, so para is often favored).\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n\nThe key relationships in the target are:\n*   -OEt (C1) and -tBu (C2) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu (C2) and -NO2 (C3) are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt (C1) and -NO2 (C3) are **meta** to each other.\n\nSynthesizing this specific 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern requires careful control of the reaction sequence, likely involving blocking groups or exploiting subtle differences in directing effects.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options Step-by-Step**\n\nWe will now analyze each proposed reaction sequence. A \"high-yield\" synthesis implies that each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, ideally relying on the major product of the previous step.\n\n**Option A & C:** These options, as written in the prompt, contain typographical errors (e.g., repeated roman numerals) and chemically questionable steps. For instance, in option C, step (vi) suggests nitrating a molecule that already contains a diazonium (-N2+) group and a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) group. Both are extremely deactivating, making electrophilic aromatic substitution (like nitration) practically impossible. Similarly, Option A is syntactically confused. These options are unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Option B:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, and then Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions generally fail with anilines because the basic amino group (-NH2) coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This makes step (iii) very problematic for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Option D:** Let's analyze this sequence in detail. It appears to be the most chemically sound progression, so we will follow the products step by step.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is nitration. The t-butyl group is an ortho/para director. Due to its large steric bulk, the para product is heavily favored.\n    *   Major Product: **4-tert-butylnitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on 4-tert-butylnitrobenzene:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 4-tert-butylaniline:** This is nitration of an aniline derivative in strong acid. The amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   Directing effects:\n        *   The **-NH3+** group (at C1) is a **meta-director** (directs to C3 and C5).\n        *   The **-tBu** group (at C4) is an **ortho,para-director** (directs to C3 and C5, relative to its position).\n    *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C3 and C5). This reinforcement leads to a high yield of a specific isomer.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** Diazotization of the primary amino group.\n    *   Product: **(4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenyl)diazonium salt**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol (-OH) to an ether (-OEt).\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt first glance, the final product `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene` (a 1,3,4-substituted isomer) is **not** the target molecule `2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` (a 1,2,3-substituted isomer).\n\n**3. The Crucial Insight: Acid-Catalyzed Rearrangement**\n\nHowever, the option D provided in the prompt includes two additional steps:\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4**\n*   **ix) dilute H2SO4**\n\nThis sequence suggests a sulfonation followed by desulfonation. While this can be a blocking group strategy, here it's more likely to facilitate an **acid-catalyzed rearrangement**.\n\nFriedel-Crafts alkylations with bulky groups like tert-butyl are reversible under strong acid conditions. The tert-butyl group can detach from the ring as a tert-butyl cation (`tBu+`) and then re-attach at a different position, leading to the thermodynamically most stable isomer.\n\nLet's apply this concept:\n1.  The sequence `i-vii` synthetically produces `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene`.\n2.  Step `viii) SO3/H2SO4` provides the strong acidic conditions necessary for the `tBu` group to migrate.\n3.  The `tBu` group at position 4 leaves, and the `tBu+` cation then re-alkylates the `1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene` intermediate.\n4.  Where does it re-attach? We must look at the directing effects on `1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`:\n    *   The **-OEt** group (at C1) is a strong ortho/para director, activating positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The **-NO2** group (at C3) is a meta director, deactivating the ring.\n5.  The electrophilic `tBu+` cation will preferentially attack one of the positions activated by the powerful ethoxy group. Attachment at C4 would simply reform the starting material of this step. Attachment at C2 is also possible.\n    *   **Attachment at C2** yields **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which can also be named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. **This is the desired target molecule.**\n\nThe final step `ix) dilute H2SO4` would serve to quench the reaction and remove any sulfonic acid groups that might have attached to the ring during the process, ensuring the final product is the rearranged ether.\n\nTherefore, sequence D is the only one that represents a coherent synthetic strategy which, through a plausible (though advanced) acid-catalyzed rearrangement step, leads to the high-yield formation of the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
