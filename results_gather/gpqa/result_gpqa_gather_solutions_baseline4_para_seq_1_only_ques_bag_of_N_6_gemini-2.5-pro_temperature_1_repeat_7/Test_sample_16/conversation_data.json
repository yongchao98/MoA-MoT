This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant (K_d). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [CaY]²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium will be 'x'.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for K_d:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation:** The formation constant K_f is very large, which means the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:** Now, we solve the simplified equation for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C. The calculation was confirmed by the python code output (`6.32e-07`).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the equilibrium of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex can dissociate into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction for this dissociation is:\n\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the Formation Constant (K_f)**\n\nWe are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set Up an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex and assume that some amount, 'x', dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is 'x'.\n\n**4. Solve for 'x'**\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the equation with the approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x':\n\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x', which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches the result from the code execution (`6.3e-07`).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical system and the question:** We have a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻, with an initial stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M. The question asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n\n2.  **Write down the relevant chemical reaction:** The system will reach equilibrium through the dissociation of the complex into its constituent ions. The reaction is:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Relate the given constant to the reaction:** We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻  ⇌  [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n    K_f = [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    The reaction we are analyzing is the dissociation, which is the reverse of the formation. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** This table helps track the concentrations of all species as the system moves from the initial state to equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed at equilibrium.\n    *   **Reaction:**      [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺  +  EDTA⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M            0 M       0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x              +x        +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**  (0.02 - x) M       x M       x M\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:** Use the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of K_d.\n    K_d = ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) / [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ]\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The dissociation constant K_d is very small (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹), which indicates that the reaction barely proceeds to the right. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation becomes:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺].\n    x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculation was confirmed using the python script, which gave an output of 6.32e-07.\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value, 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium in question is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions.

Therefore, we can assume that x is much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nSolve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nSolve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The output `Exact calculation for x: 6.32e-07` shows that the value is identical to the simplified one, at least to three significant figures.\n    *   This confirms that the approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` was valid because 'x' is indeed much smaller than 0.02.\n\n2.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is calculated to be $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    *   This value corresponds to option C, which is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Formulation**: The reasoning is sound, and the calculation has been verified. I am ready to provide the final answer. The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a 0.02 M solution of Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry**: We are given a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $CaY^{2-}$ (where Y represents the EDTA ligand). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium is described by the dissociation of the complex:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate to the Formation Constant ($K_f$)**: The problem provides the formation constant ($K_{Ca-EDTA}$ or $K_f$), which is for the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table**: To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of $CaY^{2-}$ that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n    *   The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M.\n    *   Initially, there are no free $Ca^{2+}$ or $Y^{4-}$ ions.\n    *   As the complex dissociates, the concentration of reactants decreases by 'x' and the products increase by 'x'.\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression**: Now we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve**: The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the right for the formation reaction, meaning the complex is very stable and dissociates very little. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the following approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation now becomes much simpler:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The equilibrium expression for formation is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table**: We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations at equilibrium. We start with 0.02 M of the complex.

This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n6.  **Solving for x**: The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Finally, we take the square root to find x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\ M$\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option D.

The reaction for the formation of the complex is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibrium Constant:** The stability or formation constant ($K_f$, also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given by:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    Since we are starting with the complex and it is dissociating, we are looking at the reverse reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.

This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is the dissociation:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant (K_d). The dissociation constant is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species      | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [CaY]²⁻      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium will be 'x'.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for K_d:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation:** The formation constant K_f is very large, which means the dissociation constant K_d is very small (2 x 10⁻¹¹). This indicates that the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by assuming:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:** Now, we solve the simplified equation for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C. The calculation was confirmed by the python code output (`6.32e-07`).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the equilibrium of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex can dissociate into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($EDTA^{4-}$). The reaction for this dissociation is:\n\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the Formation Constant (K_f)**\n\nWe are given the formation constant ($K_f$), which describes the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n\n$Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\nThe expression for the formation constant is:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set Up an ICE Table**\n\nTo find the equilibrium concentrations, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table. We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex and assume that some amount, 'x', dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, at equilibrium is 'x'.\n\n**4. Solve for 'x'**\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n\n$K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the equation with the approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x':\n\n$x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x \\approx \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to 'x', which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches the result from the code execution (`6.3e-07`).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 1.0x10^-2 M\nD) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical system and the question:** We have a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻, with an initial stoichiometric concentration of 0.02 M. The question asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺].\n\n2.  **Write down the relevant chemical reaction:** The system will reach equilibrium through the dissociation of the complex into its constituent ions. The reaction is:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Relate the given constant to the reaction:** We are given the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻  ⇌  [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n    K_f = [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ] / ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    The reaction we are analyzing is the dissociation, which is the reverse of the formation. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** This table helps track the concentrations of all species as the system moves from the initial state to equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed at equilibrium.\n    *   **Reaction:**      [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻  ⇌  Ca²⁺  +  EDTA⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M            0 M       0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x              +x        +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**  (0.02 - x) M       x M       x M\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:** Use the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table and the value of K_d.\n    K_d = ( [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] ) / [ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ]\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:** The dissociation constant K_d is very small (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹), which indicates that the reaction barely proceeds to the right. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation becomes:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n7.  **Calculate x:** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺].\n    x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculation was confirmed using the python script, which gave an output of 6.32e-07.\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\n    The calculated value, 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium in question is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n$[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions.

Therefore, we can assume that x is much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). This allows us to simplify the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nSolve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nSolve for x by taking the square root:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x, which is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The output `Exact calculation for x: 6.32e-07` shows that the value is identical to the simplified one, at least to three significant figures.\n    *   This confirms that the approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` was valid because 'x' is indeed much smaller than 0.02.\n\n2.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is calculated to be $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    *   This value corresponds to option C, which is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Formulation**: The reasoning is sound, and the calculation has been verified. I am ready to provide the final answer. The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a 0.02 M solution of Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry**: We are given a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $CaY^{2-}$ (where Y represents the EDTA ligand). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium is described by the dissociation of the complex:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate to the Formation Constant ($K_f$)**: The problem provides the formation constant ($K_{Ca-EDTA}$ or $K_f$), which is for the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table**: To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of $CaY^{2-}$ that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n    *   The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M.\n    *   Initially, there are no free $Ca^{2+}$ or $Y^{4-}$ ions.\n    *   As the complex dissociates, the concentration of reactants decreases by 'x' and the products increase by 'x'.\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression**: Now we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve**: The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the right for the formation reaction, meaning the complex is very stable and dissociates very little. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the following approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation now becomes much simpler:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

This complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The reaction for the formation of the complex is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibrium Constant:** The stability or formation constant ($K_f$, also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given by:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    Since we are starting with the complex and it is dissociating, we are looking at the reverse reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :------------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Substitute Equilibrium Concentrations into the $K_f$ Expression:**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for x:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions at equilibrium:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that forms at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of $EDTA^{4-}$ formed will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex that dissociates will be 'x'.\n\n| Species            | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :----------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the Kf expression:**\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve:** The formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$). This means the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction (i.e., very little of the complex will dissociate). Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.
