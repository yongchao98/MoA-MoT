    "The Python script successfully traced the multi-step organic synthesis.\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene was nitrated to form nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Bromination:** The nitro group directed the incoming bromine to the meta position, forming 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n3.  **Reduction:** The nitro group was reduced to an amino group, yielding 3-bromoaniline.\n4.  **Diazotization:** The amino group was converted into a diazonium salt, 3-bromobenzenediazonium.\n5.  **Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction:** This diazonium salt was coupled with anisole. The methoxy group of anisole is an ortho, para-director, and the coupling occurred at the less sterically hindered para position.\n\nThe final product was correctly identified as 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
