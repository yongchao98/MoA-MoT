    "The Python script successfully derived the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\nThe derivation started with the given information that the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`. Using the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax, `plx = 1/r`, and applying the chain rule for distributions, `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`, the script transformed the variables.\n\nThe calculation proceeded as follows:\n1.  `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` was converted to be in terms of `r`: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`.\n2.  The derivative `d(plx)/dr` was calculated as `-1/r^2`. Its absolute value is `1/r^2`.\n3.  These were combined: `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`.\n4.  The final simplified relationship is `dN/dr ∝ r^3`.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
