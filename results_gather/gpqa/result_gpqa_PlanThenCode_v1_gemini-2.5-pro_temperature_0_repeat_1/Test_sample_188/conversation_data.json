Based on physics principles, populate the dictionary: Magnons, Phonons, and Pions are all Goldstone/pseudo-Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions are topological solitons, which are a different class of excitation.\n    4.

    "The code successfully analyzed the nature of the four listed particles. It correctly identified that Magnons, Phonons, and Pions are all considered Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons, which are the characteristic excitations resulting from spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. In contrast, it correctly identified that a Skyrmion is a topological soliton, a stable, particle-like configuration whose existence is protected by the topology of the field, not by being a Goldstone boson of a broken symmetry. Therefore, the Skyrmion is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
