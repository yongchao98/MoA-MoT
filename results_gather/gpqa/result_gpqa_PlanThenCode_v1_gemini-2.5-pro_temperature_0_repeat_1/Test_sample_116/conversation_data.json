    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Define optical isomerism as a property of chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n2.  Analyze compound 1, a substituted biphenyl, for atropisomerism (axial chirality) caused by sterically hindered rotation around the central single bond.\n3.  Analyze compound 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, for a chiral carbon center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n4.  Analyze compound 3, benzophenone, for any elements of chirality, noting its symmetry.\n5.  Analyze compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, for any elements of chirality, noting its symmetry and that it is a geometric isomer.\n6.

    "The code successfully analyzed four organic compounds for optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate** was identified as having optical isomerism due to atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality caused by restricted rotation around the central single bond.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** was identified as having optical isomerism because it contains a chiral carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups.\n3.  **benzophenone** was identified as achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate** was identified as achiral due to its planar structure and having both a plane and a center of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n\nThe analysis correctly concludes that only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
