    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  State the problem, which is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`, where `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`.\n2.  Apply the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n3.  Define the terms for the surface integral over the sphere of radius `R`. The vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r_hat` and the differential surface element is `dS = dS * r_hat`.\n4.  Evaluate the dot product `f ⋅ dS` on the surface of the sphere. Since both vectors are purely radial, the dot product simplifies to the product of their magnitudes.\n5.  Set up and evaluate the resulting surface integral. The term `1/R^2` is constant and can be taken out of the integral, leaving the integral of `dS` over the sphere, which is the total surface area.\n6.  Calculate the final result by multiplying the field's magnitude on the surface by the total surface area of the sphere and print the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_divergence_theorem_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the analytical solution to the problem using the Divergence Theorem.\n    It prints the steps of the derivation to arrive at the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Problem: Evaluate the volume integral of ∇ ⋅ f for a sphere of radius R,\")\n    print(\"where the vector field f = (1/r^2) * r_hat (r_hat is the radial unit vector).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"PLAN STEP 1 & 2: Apply the Divergence Theorem.\")\n    print(\"The Divergence Theorem states: ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)\")\n    print(\"We will solve the surface integral on the right, over the surface of the sphere.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"PLAN STEP 3: Define the terms for the surface integral.\")\n    print(\"The surface S is a sphere of constant radius R.\")\n    print(\"On this surface, the vector field is f = (1/R^2) * r_hat.\")\n    print(\"The differential surface area vector is dS = dS * r_hat, pointing radially outward.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"PLAN STEP 4: Evaluate the dot product f ⋅ dS.\")\n    print(\"f ⋅ dS = ( (1/R^2) * r_hat ) ⋅ ( dS * r_hat )\")\n    print(\"Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself (r_hat ⋅ r_hat) is 1, this simplifies to:\")\n    print(\"f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * dS\\n\")\n\n    print(\"PLAN STEP 5: Evaluate the surface integral ∮_S (f ⋅ dS).\")\n    print(\"∮_S (1/R^2) dS\")\n    print(\"Since R is a constant radius, 1/R^2 can be moved outside the integral:\")\n    print(\"= (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS\")\n    print(\"The integral ∮_S dS is the total surface area of the sphere.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"PLAN STEP 6: Calculate the final result.\")\n    print(\"The surface area of a sphere is 4 * π * R^2.\")\n    print(\"So, the integral = (1/R^2) * (4 * π * R^2)\")\n    print(\"The R^2 terms cancel out, leaving:\")\n    \n    # The calculation is symbolic, but we can represent it.\n    # Let's use a variable for pi for clarity.\n    pi = math.pi\n    final_answer_value = 4 * pi\n    \n    print(f\"Final Answer = 4 * π ≈ {final_answer_value:.4f}\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this result to the given options, the correct choice is A.\")\n\nsolve_divergence_theorem_problem()\n```",
    "The Python code successfully solves the problem by applying the Divergence Theorem. The theorem converts the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field `f` into a surface integral of `f` over the boundary of the volume, which is a sphere of radius R.\n\nThe code correctly evaluates this surface integral. On the surface of the sphere, the magnitude of the field `f` is constant at `1/R^2`. The surface integral is then calculated by multiplying this constant magnitude by the total surface area of the sphere, which is `4 * π * R^2`. The `R^2` terms cancel out, yielding a final result of `4π`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
