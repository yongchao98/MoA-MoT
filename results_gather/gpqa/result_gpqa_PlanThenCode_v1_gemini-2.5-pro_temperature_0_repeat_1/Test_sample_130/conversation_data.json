    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of a chemical reaction and its resulting products' spectroscopic data.\n\n### PLAN\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** Deduce the structures of the diene and dienophile from the reaction description and the initial NMR data for the anhydride.\n2.  **Determine Reaction and Products:** Recognize the reaction as a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, which produces two stereoisomeric products: *endo* and *exo*.\n3.  **Establish Major/Minor Products:** Analyze the steric hindrance caused by the four methyl groups on the diene. Conclude that due to significant steric clash, the *exo* isomer will be the major product, contrary to the usual Alder endo rule.\n4.  **Assign ¹H NMR Signals:** Assign the proton resonances described in the options to the specific protons in the product structure based on typical chemical shifts, multiplicity, and integration.\n5.  **Analyze NOESY Data:** Determine which protons are close in space in the major (*exo*) product but far apart in the minor (*endo*) product. A Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) cross-peak connects protons that are spatially close (< 5 Å).\n6.  **Select the Correct Answer:** Match the predicted NOE for the major (*exo*) product with the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step logical deduction to solve the provided chemistry problem.\n    The output explains the reasoning behind identifying the reactants, the reaction products,\n    and the interpretation of the NOESY NMR data to arrive at the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the reactants\n    # The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride with a single 1H NMR peak at 7 ppm\n    # and two 13C NMR peaks is maleic anhydride.

    "The analysis correctly identifies the reactants as maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which undergo a Diels-Alder reaction. Due to significant steric hindrance from the four methyl groups on the diene, the *exo* isomer is the major product, while the *endo* isomer is the minor product.\n\nIn the major (*exo*) product, the anhydride ring is positioned on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond of the bicyclic system. This spatial arrangement brings the two protons on the anhydride ring (a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the six protons of the two methyl groups attached to the double bond (a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). This proximity results in a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.\n\nIn the minor (*endo*) product, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, far from these methyl groups, so this cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Therefore, the cross-peak unique to the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>"
