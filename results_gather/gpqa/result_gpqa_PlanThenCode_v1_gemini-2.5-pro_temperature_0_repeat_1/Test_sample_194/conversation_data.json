    "PLAN:\n1.  Establish the geometric relationship for a transit: the impact parameter `b` is related to the semi-major axis `a`, orbital inclination `i`, and stellar radius `R_star` by the formula `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`.\n2.  For the first planet, use its given impact parameter (`b1 = 0.2`) to find the value of `a1 * cos(i)` in terms of the star's radius.\n3.  Determine the condition for the second planet to have the maximum possible period while still exhibiting a transit. This occurs at the largest possible semi-major axis (`a2_max`), which corresponds to a grazing transit where the planet's center passes over the star's limb. This limiting impact parameter is `b2_max = 1`.\n4.  Use this limiting impact parameter to find the value of `a2_max * cos(i)` in terms of the star's radius.\n5.  Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a2_max / a1`). Since both planets share the same orbital plane (same `i`) and orbit the same star (same `R_star`), these terms will cancel out.\n6.  Apply Kepler's Third Law (`P² ∝ a³`) to relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes of the two planets. Use this law and the calculated ratio of the semi-major axes to find the maximum period for the second planet (`P2_max`).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN\n# 1. Define the relationship between semi-major axis (a), inclination (i), \n#    impact parameter (b), and stellar radius (R_star).\n# 2. Use the given data for Planet 1 to establish a baseline.\n# 3. Determine the maximum impact parameter for Planet 2 to be considered transiting.\n#    The maximum period corresponds to the widest orbit, which means the largest\n#    impact parameter, b_max = 1 (center of planet grazes the star's limb).\n# 4. Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets.\n# 5. Use Kepler's Third Law to find the maximum period for Planet 2.\n\n# Given values\nP1 = 3.0  # days, orbital period of planet 1\nb1 = 0.2  # unitless, impact parameter of planet 1\n\n# The problem states that for a planet to exhibit a transit, its center must pass\n# in front of the stellar disk. The limiting case for this is when the center of the\n# planet grazes the limb of the star, which corresponds to an impact parameter of 1.\nb2_max = 1.0\n\n# The impact parameter b is defined as b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star,\n# where 'a' is the semi-major axis, 'i' is the orbital inclination,\n# and 'R_star' is the stellar radius.\n\n# For planet 1:\n# a1 * cos(i) = b1 * R_star\n\n# For planet 2 at its maximum period (and thus maximum semi-major axis):\n# a2_max * cos(i) = b2_max * R_star\n\n# We can find the ratio of the semi-major axes. The terms cos(i) and R_star\n# are the same for both and will cancel out.\n# (a2_max * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = (b2_max * R_star) / (b1 * R_star)\n# a2_max / a1 = b2_max / b1\naxis_ratio = b2_max / b1\n\n# According to Kepler's Third Law, (P^2) / (a^3) is constant for all planets\n# orbiting the same star.\n# (P2_max^2 / a2_max^3) = (P1^2 / a1^3)\n# P2_max^2 = P1^2 * (a2_max / a1)^3\n# P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)\n\n# Calculate the maximum period for planet 2\nP2_max = P1 * (axis_ratio)**(3.0/2.0)\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the semi-major axes (a2_max / a1) is: {axis_ratio}\")\nprint(f\"The maximum orbital period of the second planet is: {P2_max:.1f} days\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option A.\")\n\n```",
    "The code calculates the maximum orbital period for a second planet that can still exhibit both transit and occultation events. The key insight is that the maximum period corresponds to the widest possible orbit, which is limited by the geometry of the transit. For a transit/occultation to occur, the center of the planet must pass across the disk of the star. The limiting case for this is a \"grazing\" transit where the planet's center passes exactly over the star's limb, corresponding to an impact parameter (`b`) of 1.\n\nThe code first establishes the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets by using the ratio of their impact parameters (`a2/a1 = b2/b1`). With the first planet's impact parameter `b1 = 0.2` and the second planet's maximum impact parameter `b2_max = 1`, the ratio of the semi-major axes is `1 / 0.2 = 5`.\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law (`P² ∝ a³`), the relationship between the periods and semi-major axes is `P2 = P1 * (a2/a1)^(3/2)`. Plugging in the known values (`P1 = 3` days and `a2/a1 = 5`), the maximum period for the second planet is calculated to be `3 * 5^(1.5)`, which is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<A>>>"
