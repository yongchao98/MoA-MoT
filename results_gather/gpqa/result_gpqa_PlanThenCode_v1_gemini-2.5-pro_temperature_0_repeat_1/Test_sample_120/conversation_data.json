    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:** Identify the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. Identify the reagent, Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n2.  **Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):** Apply the given rule that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. The epoxide is between C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of Attack:** Apply the rule that the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the point of attack (SN2 mechanism). This means the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n4.  **Deduce the Product Structure:** The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, forming an alcohol at C1 after an acidic workup. This results in a tetramethylcyclohexanol derivative.\n5.  **Determine the Product's IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry:** Re-number the resulting cyclohexanol according to IUPAC rules (C1 is the carbon with the -OH group) to find the correct substituent locants. Trace the stereochemical outcome at all chiral centers based on the initial configuration and the inversion at the reaction site (C6).\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:** Compare the deduced product name and stereochemistry with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the stereochemical outcome of the given organic reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
