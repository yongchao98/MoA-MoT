    "The code successfully determined the nature of the observed absorption line by first calculating the cosmological redshift of the source. Given a distance of 2.1 Gpc, the redshift was calculated to be approximately z = 0.49.\n\nUsing this redshift, the observed energy of the absorption line (3.9 µeV) was corrected to its rest-frame energy, which was found to be approximately 5.81 µeV.\n\nThis calculated rest-frame energy is an excellent match for the well-known energy of the 21-cm hyperfine transition line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), which is approximately 5.87 µeV. The 21-cm line is the characteristic spectral signature of the cold atomic interstellar medium. Therefore, the observation is most likely of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
