    "The analysis correctly identifies the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A:** Lithium borohydride (`LiBH4`) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces the ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains intact. The subsequent acid workup (`H+`) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product. Since the reaction does not affect the stereocenter, the (R)-product must originate from the (R)-starting material. Therefore, A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** Borane (`BH3`) is a strong reducing agent that preferentially reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched. The acid workup then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification to form the same lactone product. As with the first reaction, the stereocenter is not altered. Thus, the (S)-product must come from the (S)-starting material. Therefore, B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
