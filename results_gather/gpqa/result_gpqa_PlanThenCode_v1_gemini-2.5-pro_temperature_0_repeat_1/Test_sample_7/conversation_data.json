  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a plan to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n*   **PLAN:**\n    1.  Represent the experimental resistance data for each mutant in a Python dictionary.\n    2.  Analyze the role of gene G2 by examining the phenotypes of the `g2`, `g1g2`, and `g2g3` mutants. This will test for epistasis, where the `g2` mutation's effect might mask the effects of `g1` and `g3`, suggesting it is an upstream regulator like a transcription factor.\n    3.  Analyze the interaction between genes G1 and G3 by comparing the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant to the individual `g1` and `g3` mutants. This will check for synergistic effects, which are characteristic of gene redundancy.\n    4.  Define a helper function to systematically check for epistasis between any two genes based on the provided data.\n    5.  Evaluate each of the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) by comparing their claims against the results from the data analysis.\n    6.

    "Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn from the experimental data:\n\n1.  **G2 is an upstream regulator (likely the transcription factor):** The phenotype of the `g2` mutant (0% resistance) completely masks the phenotypes of the `g1` and `g3` mutants in the `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants (which also show 0% resistance). This is a clear case of epistasis, indicating G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway.\n\n2.  **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:** The individual loss of resistance for `g1` (25%) and `g3` (50%) is significantly less than the loss of resistance in the `g1g3` double mutant (90%). This synergistic effect, where the double mutant has a much more severe phenotype than the sum of the single mutants, is a classic indicator of gene redundancy. This suggests G1 and G3 perform overlapping functions.\n\nComparing these findings to the given options, Option A is the most accurate. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and the redundant nature of G1 and G3. While its claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is incorrect, it captures the two primary conclusions from the data better than any other option.\n\n<<<A>>>"
