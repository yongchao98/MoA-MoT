For each option (A, B, C, D), evaluate the technique described and its relevance to measuring mitochondrial function.\n3.  Option A (JC-1 dye) measures mitochondrial membrane potential, a key indicator of mitochondrial health. This is relevant.\n4.  Option B combines mitochondrial isolation with a glucose uptake assay.

    "The analysis of the experimental options reveals that options A, C, and D are all valid methods for assessing mitochondrial function. Option A measures mitochondrial membrane potential, Option C measures mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and Option D measures cellular ATP levels, which are primarily generated by mitochondria.\n\nOption B, however, describes a flawed experiment. While differential centrifugation correctly isolates mitochondria, the subsequent Glucose Uptake Assay measures the transport of glucose across the cell's plasma membrane. This process is irrelevant to the function of the already-isolated mitochondria. Therefore, this experiment would not provide any useful information about the drug's effect on mitochondrial activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
