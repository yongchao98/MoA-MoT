    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Analyze the effect of placing a charge `+q` inside the cavity of a conductor. This involves understanding charge induction.\n2.  A charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface (the cavity wall) to shield the conductor material from the field of `+q`.\n3.  Since the conductor was initially neutral, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n4.  The electric field outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges (`+q` in the cavity, `-q` on the inner surface, `+q` on the outer surface).\n5.  Due to electrostatic shielding, the net field from the charge `+q` inside and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero everywhere outside the cavity. Therefore, the external field is determined solely by the `+q` charge on the outer surface.\n6.  For a spherical conductor, the charge `+q` on the outer surface distributes uniformly. The electric field produced by a uniformly charged spherical shell at an external point is identical to that of a point charge of the same magnitude located at the center of the sphere. The distance from the center to point P is `L`. Thus, the field is `E = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / L²)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_electrostatics_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given electrostatics problem by explaining the physics principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the electric field outside a conductor with an internal cavity and charge.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Charge Induction\n    print(\"1.

    "The Python code successfully reasoned through the electrostatics problem. It correctly applied the principles of charge induction and electrostatic shielding.\n\n1.  A charge `+q` placed inside the cavity induces a charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  To maintain the conductor's initial neutrality, a charge `+q` appears on the outer surface.\n3.  Due to electrostatic shielding, the electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge on its outer surface. The internal charges (`+q` in the cavity and `-q` on the inner wall) have no net effect on the external field.\n4.  The `+q` charge on the outer surface distributes itself uniformly because the outer surface is a sphere.\n5.  The electric field from a uniformly charged spherical shell at an external point (distance `L` from the center) is identical to the field of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the sphere.\n6.  Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge at distance `L`, which is $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
