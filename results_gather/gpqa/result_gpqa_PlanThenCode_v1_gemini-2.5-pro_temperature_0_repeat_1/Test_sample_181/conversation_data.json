    "This is a conceptual question about the physical model behind the Mott-Gurney equation.

    "The Python script successfully analyzed the validity conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation. It broke down the core assumptions of the model: it must be a single-carrier, trap-free device with Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) and negligible diffusion current.\n\nThe script then evaluated each option:\n*   **Option A** was found to be a perfect match for all the required assumptions.\n*   **Option B** was incorrect because the model is for single-carrier, not two-carrier, devices.\n*   **Option C** was incorrect because a Schottky contact limits injection, whereas an Ohmic contact is required for the space-charge-limited regime.\n*   **Option D** was incorrect because the model assumes drift current is dominant, not negligible.\n\nThe analysis concluded that statement A is the only true statement.\n\n<<<A>>>"
