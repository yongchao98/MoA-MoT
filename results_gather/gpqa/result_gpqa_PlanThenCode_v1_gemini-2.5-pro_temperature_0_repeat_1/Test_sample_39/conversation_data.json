    "PLAN:\n1.  Define a function to analyze the chemist's statement.\n2.  Inside the function, establish that \"on top of each other\" is a common colloquialism in chemistry labs, typically referring to a failure to separate compounds during a purification process.\n3.  Consider the most common purification technique in synthetic organic chemistry: chromatography (like Thin Layer Chromatography or Column Chromatography).\n4.  Explain that chromatography separates compounds based on their polarity. Compounds with similar polarities travel at similar rates and are difficult to separate, appearing as overlapping spots or fractions.\n5.  Evaluate the given options (A, B, C, D) in this context and identify the one that directly relates to this separation principle.\n6.

    "The Python script analyzed the common laboratory phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other.\" It correctly identified this as jargon for a failed separation of chemical compounds. The script reasoned that the most common purification technique in synthetic organic chemistry is chromatography, which separates molecules based on their polarity. Therefore, if compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means they have very similar polarities and could not be resolved by the chromatographic method. The script evaluated all options and concluded that similar polarities (Option D) is the most fitting explanation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
