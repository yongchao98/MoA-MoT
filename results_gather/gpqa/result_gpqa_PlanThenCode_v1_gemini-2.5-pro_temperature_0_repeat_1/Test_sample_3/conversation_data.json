    "PLAN:\n1.  Define the four Maxwell's equations and the physical concepts they represent (e.g., divergence of B, curl of E).\n2.  Analyze the physical meaning of a magnetic monopole: it is a source or sink of magnetic field lines.\n3.  Determine how this new physical reality would alter the equations. The existence of a source means the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B) can no longer be zero.\n4.  Consider the consequences of a *moving* magnetic monopole. This would constitute a \"magnetic current,\" which would act as a source for a circulating electric field, thus modifying Faraday's Law (the curl of E).\n5.

    "The Python script correctly analyzed the physical implications of magnetic monopoles on Maxwell's equations.\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which is the mathematical way of saying there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated sources or sinks of magnetic field lines). If monopoles existed, this equation would have to be modified to include a magnetic charge density term (∇ ⋅ B = ρ_m), directly changing the law related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t):** This equation relates a changing magnetic field to a circulating electric field. To maintain symmetry with Ampere's Law (which includes electric currents), the existence of moving magnetic monopoles (a \"magnetic current,\" J_m) would require a new term in Faraday's Law, making it ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m. This modifies the law related to the **circulation (or curl) of the electric field**.\n\nThe script correctly identified these two changes and matched them to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
