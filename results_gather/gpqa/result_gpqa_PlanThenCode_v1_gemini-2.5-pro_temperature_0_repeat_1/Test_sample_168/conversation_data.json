    "Here is a plan to analyze the nuclear decay scenario:\n\n1.  **Establish Total Energy:** Define a constant representing the total energy (`Q_total`) released in the decay, which is determined by the mass difference between initial and final heavy nuclei and is the same for both decay modes.\n2.  **Analyze Original Decay (2V):** Model the endpoint of the E-particle energy spectrum. The endpoint (`Q_original`) occurs when the other light particles (the two V's) carry away the minimum possible kinetic energy. In a multi-particle emission, this minimum can be zero.\n3.  **Analyze Variant Decay (M):** Model the endpoint for the variant decay. The final state includes a single, massless particle `M`. Due to momentum conservation, this single particle `M` cannot have zero energy/momentum when the E particles have energy/momentum. Therefore, it must always carry away some non-zero energy.\n4.  **Calculate New Endpoint:** The new endpoint (`Q_variant`) will be the `Q_total` minus the minimum possible energy carried away by the particle `M`.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Compare `Q_original` and `Q_variant`. State the conclusion about the spectrum's nature (continuous vs. discrete) and the change in its endpoint, which will directly lead to the correct multiple-choice answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and compares two nuclear decay modes to determine the change\n    in the energy spectrum of emitted E particles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

    "The analysis shows that in both decay scenarios, the final state consists of multiple particles (2B, 2E, and either 2V or M). When energy is shared among three or more final-state particles, the energy spectrum of any one particle type (like E) is continuous. Therefore, the spectrum remains continuous.\n\nIn the original decay, the endpoint energy for the E particles occurs when the two V particles carry away the minimum possible energy, which can be zero. Thus, the E particles can have up to the total decay energy, `Q_total`.\n\nIn the variant decay, there is only one other light particle, M. Due to momentum conservation, if the E particles have momentum, the single M particle must also have momentum (and therefore energy) to balance it. M cannot be at rest. This means M must always carry away some non-zero amount of energy. Consequently, the maximum energy available for the E particles is less than `Q_total`.\n\nThe final result is that the spectrum remains continuous, but its endpoint decreases.\n\n<<<C>>>"
