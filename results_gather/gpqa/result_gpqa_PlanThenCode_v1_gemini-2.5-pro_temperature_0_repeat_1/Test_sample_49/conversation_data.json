    "Here is a plan to determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram:\n\n1.  **Identify the Loop Factor:** In the provided expression, locate the term that is characteristic of loop integrals in quantum field theory. This is the `1/(4pi)` term.\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formula:** Remember that in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram calculation contributes a factor of `1/(4pi)^2` to the amplitude after integration.\n3.  **Formulate an Equation:** Let `L` be the number of loops. The total loop factor will be `(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)`. Equate this to the factor found in the given expression, which is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n4.  **Solve for L:** Solve the equation `2L = 6` to find the value of `L`.\n5.  **Print the Result:** Display the reasoning and the final calculated number of loops.\n\n```python\n# The number of loops in a Feynman diagram calculation in 4D spacetime\n# is directly related to the power of the loop integration factor, 1/(4pi)^2.\n# Each loop contributes a power of 2 to the (4pi) term in the denominator.\n\n# The given expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2\n# The loop-dependent factor is 1/(4pi)^6.\n\n# We can establish the relationship:\n# (4pi)^(2 * L) = (4pi)^6\n# where L is the number of loops.\n\n# This simplifies to an equation for the exponents:\n# 2 * L = 6\n\n# Solving for L:\npower_of_4pi = 6\npower_per_loop = 2\nnumber_of_loops = power_of_4pi / power_per_loop\n\nprint(\"Step 1: The loop factor in the expression is 1/(4pi)^6.\")\nprint(\"Step 2: Each loop in 4D QFT contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2.\")\nprint(\"Step 3: We set up the equation: 2 * L = 6, where L is the number of loops.\")\nprint(f\"Step 4: Solving for L gives L = 6 / 2 = {int(number_of_loops)}.\")\nprint(f\"Conclusion: The Feynman diagram contained {int(number_of_loops)} loops.\")\n```",
    "The Python code successfully determined the number of loops in the Feynman diagram. It correctly identified that the loop-dependent factor in the given expression is `1/(4pi)^6`. By applying the standard principle from quantum field theory that each loop in a four-dimensional spacetime contributes a factor of `1/(4pi)^2`, the code established the equation `2 * L = 6`, where `L` is the number of loops. Solving this equation yielded the result that the diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
