  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The Python script successfully translated the provided DNA sequence. The analysis revealed that the sequence begins with the codons for the HA tag (MYPYDVPDYA) followed by a Lysine (K). However, the very next codon is `TGA`, which is a stop codon. This premature stop codon causes the ribosome to detach from the mRNA and cease protein synthesis, resulting in a truncated, non-functional peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This directly explains the observed lack of protein overexpression.\n\n<<<C>>>"
