    "PLAN:\n1.  State the formula for the geometric transit probability for a planet in a circular orbit, which is proportional to the stellar radius divided by the semi-major axis (`Prob ∝ R_s / a`).\n2.  Use Kepler's Third Law to establish the relationship between the semi-major axis (`a`), the stellar mass (`M_s`), and the orbital period (`P`), which is `a ∝ (M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n3.

    "The code successfully calculated the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2. The transit probability is proportional to the stellar radius (`R_s`) and inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (`a`). Using Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis can be expressed in terms of stellar mass (`M_s`) and orbital period (`P`), leading to the relationship `Prob ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`.\n\nGiven the relationships `R_s1 = R_s2`, `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, and `P1 = P2 / 3`, the ratio of probabilities `Prob_1 / Prob_2` was calculated. The result shows that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred observation target.\n\n<<<D>>>"
