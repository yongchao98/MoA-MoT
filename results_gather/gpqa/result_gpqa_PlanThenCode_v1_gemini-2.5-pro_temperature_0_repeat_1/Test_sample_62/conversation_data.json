    "PLAN:\n1.  Define the necessary physical constants (reduced Planck constant, speed of light, atomic mass unit in kg) and the given parameters for the molecule (masses, bond length, angular frequency).\n2.  Convert all input parameters to their base SI units (kilograms for mass, meters for length).\n3.  Calculate the reduced mass (μ) of the diatomic molecule using the formula: μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).\n4.  Calculate the moment of inertia (I) of the molecule, which is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, using the formula: I = μ * R².\n5.  Determine the energy difference (ΔE) for the transition. The molecule starts in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The next lowest energy state accessible by photon absorption follows the selection rules Δv=+1 and ΔJ=+1, leading to the final state (v=1, J=1). The energy of this transition is given by ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I.\n6.  Calculate the momentum (p) of the absorbed photon using the energy-momentum relation for a photon, p = ΔE / c, and print the final value to compare with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1.

    "The Python script calculated the momentum of a photon required to excite a diatomic molecule from its fundamental rovibrational state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest accessible state (v=1, J=1).\n\nThe calculation proceeded as follows:\n1.  The reduced mass (μ) of the molecule was calculated to be approximately 3.02 x 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n2.  The moment of inertia (I) was then found to be approximately 1.21 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n3.  The energy difference (ΔE) for the transition from the ground state (E₀₀) to the first excited state (E₁₁) was calculated. This energy difference, ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I, was determined to be 4.23 x 10⁻²⁰ J.\n4.  Finally, the momentum of the photon (p) was calculated using the energy-momentum relation for a photon, p = ΔE/c.\n\nThe resulting momentum was p ≈ 1.4092 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
