    "Here is a plan to determine the number of optically active compounds:\n\n1.  Define a list of the given compounds.\n2.  For each compound, analyze its molecular structure to determine if it is chiral. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters).\n3.  Key indicators of chirality include the presence of stereocenters (e.g., a carbon bonded to four different groups) without any internal planes or centers of symmetry.\n4.  The presence of stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or a specific enantiomeric name indicates chirality, unless the compound is meso (e.g., an R,S diastereomer with symmetry).\n5.  Maintain a count of the compounds identified as optically active.\n6.  Print the analysis for each compound, the final count, and the corresponding multiple-choice answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of chemical compounds to determine how many are optically active\n    and prints the reasoning and final count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # PLAN\n    # 1.
