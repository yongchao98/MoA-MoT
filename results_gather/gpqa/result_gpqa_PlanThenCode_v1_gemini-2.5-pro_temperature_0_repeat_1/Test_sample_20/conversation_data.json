The function will check for the presence of alpha-hydrogens, which are required for keto-enol tautomerism. It will print which compound lacks them.\n3.  Define a function to analyze optical isomerism for the second pair of compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate).\n4.  The function will check for the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), which is a requirement for optical isomerism.

    "The code successfully analyzed the properties of the four compounds.\n\nFor the first part (A), it determined that tautomerism requires alpha-hydrogens. Benzoquinone lacks these hydrogens, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione possesses them. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.\n\nFor the second part (B), it determined that optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3), making it chiral. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral. Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThe final result is A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
