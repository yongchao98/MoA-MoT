    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the complete code and the final answer.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  Import the `math` module for necessary mathematical functions like `sqrt`, `acos`, and `degrees`.\n2.  Define the given Lorentz factors for the electron (`gamma_e = 4`) and the positron (`gamma_p = 2`).\n3.  Apply the principle of conservation of energy. The total initial energy (`E_e + E_p`) must equal the total final energy (`2 * E_photon`). This allows us to calculate the energy of a single photon. We will work in units where the electron rest mass (`m_e`) and the speed of light (`c`) are equal to 1.\n4.  Apply the principle of conservation of momentum along the horizontal axis. The initial momentum (`p_e - p_p`) must equal the final momentum (`2 * p_photon * cos(theta)`), where `theta` is the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis.\n5.  Solve the momentum conservation equation for `cos(theta)`.\n6.  Calculate the angle `theta` using the arccosine function. The total angle between the two photons is `2 * theta`.

    "The Python code successfully calculated the angle between the two photons resulting from an electron-positron annihilation. By applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic mechanics, the code first determined the energy of each photon. Then, using the initial momenta of the electron and positron, it calculated the horizontal component of the final momentum. This allowed for the determination of the angle `theta` each photon makes with the horizontal axis. The total angle between the two photons is `2 * theta`. The script calculated this angle to be 138.19 degrees, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
