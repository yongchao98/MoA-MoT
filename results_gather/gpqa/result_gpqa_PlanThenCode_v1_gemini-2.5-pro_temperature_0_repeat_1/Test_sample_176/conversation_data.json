    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the relevant physical laws: Wien's Displacement Law for temperature and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for luminosity.\n2.  Use Wien's Law to establish the relationship between the surface temperatures of the two stars, given that their peak emission wavelengths are identical.\n3.  Write the formula for the luminosity of each star using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which relates luminosity to radius and temperature.\n4.  Create a ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 (L1 / L2).\n5.  Substitute the known relationships for the radii (R1 = 1.5 * R2) and the derived relationship for the temperatures into the luminosity ratio.\n6.  Calculate the final value of the ratio and print the result.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the relationship between the radii.\n# The problem states R1 = 1.5 * R2.\n# We can represent this as a ratio.\nradius_ratio = 1.5  # R1 / R2\n\n# 2. Determine the relationship between the temperatures.\n# According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak wavelength (lambda_max) is\n# inversely proportional to the surface temperature (T).\n# lambda_max = b / T, where b is a constant.\n# Since lambda_max_1 = lambda_max_2, it follows that T1 = T2.\n# Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is 1.\ntemperature_ratio = 1.0 # T1 / T2\n\n# 3. & 4. Use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law to find the luminosity ratio.\n# The luminosity (L) of a star is given by L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4.\n# The ratio L1 / L2 is:\n# L1 / L2 = (4*pi*R1^2*sigma*T1^4) / (4*pi*R2^2*sigma*T2^4)\n# The constants (4, pi, sigma) cancel out, leaving:\n# L1 / L2 = (R1^2 * T1^4) / (R2^2 * T2^4)\n# This can be rewritten as:\n# L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n\n# 5. & 6. Substitute the known ratios and calculate the final answer.\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio)**2 * (temperature_ratio)**4\nprint(f\"The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of: {luminosity_ratio}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n\n```",
    "The code successfully calculated the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars.\n\nAccording to Wien's Displacement Law, since the stars have the same peak emission wavelength, their surface temperatures must be identical. The luminosity of a star, treated as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that luminosity is proportional to the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power (L ∝ R²T⁴).\n\nBecause the temperatures are the same, the temperature term cancels out in the ratio of the luminosities. The problem is reduced to the square of the ratio of their radii. Given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, the luminosity of Star_1 is 1.5² = 2.25 times greater than that of Star_2. The information regarding mass and radial velocity is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe calculated factor is 2.25, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
