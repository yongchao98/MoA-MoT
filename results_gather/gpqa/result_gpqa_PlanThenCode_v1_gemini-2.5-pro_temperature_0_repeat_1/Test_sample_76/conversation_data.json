    "Based on the analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction A:** The reaction of (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene with BuLi and then H+ is a [1,2]-Stevens rearrangement. The strong base (BuLi) deprotonates the benzylic carbon, forming an ylide. The adjacent allyl group then migrates to this carbanion, and subsequent protonation yields the alcohol product, 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol.\n\n*   **Reaction B:** The thermal reaction of the complex 1,5-diene is a Cope rearrangement. This is a type of isomerization, meaning the product must have the same molecular formula and degree of saturation as the starting material. Since the starting material is a 'hexahydro' compound, the product must also be a 'hexahydro' compound. This eliminates options C and D, which list a 'tetrahydro' product.\n\nCombining these findings, the major product for A is 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol, and the major product for B is the hexahydrofluorene derivative. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
