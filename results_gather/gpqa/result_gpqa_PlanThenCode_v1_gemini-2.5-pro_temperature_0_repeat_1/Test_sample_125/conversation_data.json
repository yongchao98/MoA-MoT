    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** Determine the product(s) of the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH. A new stereocenter is formed, so we must identify the stereochemical relationship between the products.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** Determine the product(s) of the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4. Two new stereocenters are formed, so we must identify all possible stereoisomers (enantiomers and meso compounds).\n3.  **List All Products:** Combine the products from both reactions to get a complete list of all unique chemical compounds in the final mixture.\n4.  **Normal-Phase HPLC Analysis:** Count the number of expected peaks on a normal-phase (achiral) column. Remember that enantiomers are not separable on an achiral column, but diastereomers are.\n5.  **Chiral HPLC Analysis:** Count the number of expected peaks on a chiral column. A chiral column can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Compare the calculated peak counts with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes two chemical reactions and predicts the number of peaks in normal-phase and chiral HPLC.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Reaction Products and HPLC Peaks ---\")\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the reactions\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analysis of Reaction I\")\n    print(\"(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced by LAH.\")\n    print(\"The starting material has one chiral center at C5 (S-configuration).\")\n    print(\"The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\")\n    print(\"This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\")\n    print(\"These two products are diastereomers.
