    "The Python code was designed to calculate the area of a surface defined by the metric `ds^2 = \\frac{32}{(4-x^2-y^2)}(dx^2 + dy^2)` over the domain `x^2 + y^2 < 4`.\n\nThe area element was determined to be `dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} dx dy`. To compute the total area, this element was integrated over the disk of radius 2. By converting to polar coordinates, the integral becomes:\n\n`A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} d\\rho d\\theta`\n\nThis is an improper integral because the function `\\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2}` approaches infinity as `\\rho` approaches the upper limit of integration, 2. The evaluation of this integral shows that it diverges. The `sympy` output `Integral(oo + 16*I*pi, (theta, 0, 2*pi))` confirms this, as the `oo` term signifies infinity. Therefore, the area of the specified pseudosphere is infinite.\n\n<<<B>>>"
