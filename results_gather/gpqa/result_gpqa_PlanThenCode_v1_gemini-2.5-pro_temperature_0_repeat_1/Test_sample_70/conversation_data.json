    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Establish the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`). For planets around the same star with the same albedo, T_eq is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance (1/sqrt(a)).\n2.  Use Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³) to relate the orbital distance (`a`) to the orbital period (`P`). This gives a relationship where `a` is proportional to P^(2/3).\n3.  Combine the relationships from steps 1 and 2 to find how the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) depends on the orbital period (P). This will show that T_eq is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n4.  Formulate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2, T_eq(4)/T_eq(2), in terms of their orbital periods, P_4 and P_2. The ratio will be (P_4/P_2)^(-1/3), which is equivalent to (P_2/P_4)^(1/3).\n5.  Substitute the given period ratio values (P_2 = 2, P_4 = 3.5) into the formula.\n6.  Calculate the final numerical value for the temperature ratio and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of orbital periods is given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5\n# Let P_n be the orbital period of Planet_n.\n# We can assign relative period values based on the ratio.\nP_2 = 2.0\nP_4 = 3.5\n\n# The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis (a) by:\n# T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n# Kepler's Third Law states that P^2 ∝ a^3, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).\n# Substituting the relation for 'a' into the T_eq equation:\n# T_eq ∝ (1 / P^(2/3))^(1/2)\n# T_eq ∝ (P^(-2/3))^(1/2)\n# T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n# Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n# T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3)\n# This is equivalent to (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3).\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods P_2 / P_4\nperiod_ratio = P_2 / P_4\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio ** (1/3)\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet_4 / Planet_2) is: {temperature_ratio:.2f}\")\n```",
    "The Python code successfully calculated the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\nThe calculation was based on the following physical principles:\n1.  A planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance from the star (a): T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n2.  Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) to the distance: P² ∝ a³, which means a ∝ P^(2/3).\n3.  Combining these, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the orbital period to the power of -1/3: T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).\n\nTherefore, the ratio T_eq(4)/T_eq(2) is equal to (P_4/P_2)^(-1/3), or (P_2/P_4)^(1/3). Using the given relative periods of P_2 = 2 and P_4 = 3.5, the code computed (2/3.5)^(1/3), which resulted in approximately 0.83. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
