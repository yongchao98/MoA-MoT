  "question": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\n\nA) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nB) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\nC) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\nD) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

Analyze the resulting DNA sequence after the stop cassette is excised, specifically the sequence remaining between the receptor ORF and the eGFP ORF.\n4.

    "The Python code analyzed the fate of the receptor-eGFP construct after Cre-mediated recombination. The key finding is that when the `lox2272-stop-lox2272` cassette is excised by Cre recombinase, a single 34 base pair lox2272 site is left behind between the receptor's coding sequence and the eGFP's coding sequence. Because 34 is not divisible by 3, this insertion causes a frameshift mutation. This frameshift alters the reading frame for the eGFP portion of the transcript, leading to the production of a non-functional, non-fluorescent protein, which explains the lack of a green signal. The other options are less likely: the promoter is strong, the biological relationship is irrelevant to expression, and a protein trafficking issue would likely result in a mislocalized green signal, not a complete absence of it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
