    "PLAN:\n1.  Define the necessary physical constants: the rest mass energies of a proton and a neutron, and the speed of the nucleus as a fraction of the speed of light (c).\n2.  Identify the composition of the nucleus X (Lithium with 3 neutrons) as having 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n3.  Calculate the total rest mass energy (E₀) of the nucleus by summing the rest mass energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. This is a common simplification that ignores binding energy.\n4.

    "The code successfully calculated the total relativistic energy of the specified Lithium nucleus (3 protons, 3 neutrons) traveling at 0.96 times the speed of light.\n\nFirst, the rest mass energy of the nucleus was determined by summing the rest mass energies of its constituent 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Then, the Lorentz factor (γ) was calculated for the given velocity. Finally, the total relativistic energy was found by multiplying the rest mass energy by the Lorentz factor. The result was converted from MeV to GeV.\n\nThe calculated energy is 20.1197 GeV, which is closest to option D (20.132 GeV). The minor difference can be attributed to the precision of the physical constants used or the simplification of ignoring nuclear binding energy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
