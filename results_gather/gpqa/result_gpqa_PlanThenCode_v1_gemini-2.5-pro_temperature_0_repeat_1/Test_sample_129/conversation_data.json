    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line, which is given as 1216 Angstroms.\n2.  Determine the minimum observable wavelength for a ground-based optical telescope. This is limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which becomes opaque to ultraviolet light below approximately 3500 Angstroms.\n3.  Use the cosmological redshift formula, `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`, which relates the observed wavelength (`λ_observed`), the rest-frame wavelength (`λ_rest`), and the redshift (`z`).\n4.  Rearrange the formula to solve for the minimum redshift (`z_min`) required to shift the 1216 Å line to the minimum observable wavelength of 3500 Å. The formula becomes `z_min = (λ_observed_min / λ_rest) - 1`.\n5.  Calculate the value of `z_min`.\n6.  Compare the calculated redshift with the given multiple-choice options to find the closest estimate.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN Step 1 & 2: Define physical constants\n# The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line.\nlambda_rest = 1216.0  # in Angstroms\n\n# The minimum observable wavelength for a ground-based optical telescope due to\n# the atmospheric cutoff in the near-ultraviolet.\nlambda_observed_min = 3500.0  # in Angstroms\n\nprint(\"--- Estimating the Minimum Redshift for Ground-Based Lyman-Alpha Observation ---\")\nprint(f\"Rest-frame wavelength of Lyman-alpha (λ_rest): {lambda_rest} Å\")\nprint(f\"Minimum observable wavelength from ground (λ_observed_min): ~{lambda_observed_min} Å\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# PLAN Step 3 & 4: Use the redshift formula and solve for z_min\nprint(\"The cosmological redshift formula is: λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\")\nprint(\"To find the lower limit on redshift, we solve for z using the minimum observable wavelength:\")\nprint(\"z_min = (λ_observed_min / λ_rest) - 1\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# PLAN Step 5: Calculate the numerical value\nz_min = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# PLAN Step 6: Print the result and compare with options\nprint(f\"Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"z_min = ({lambda_observed_min} / {lambda_rest}) - 1\")\nprint(f\"z_min = {z_min:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the calculated value to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 2.4\")\nprint(\"B) 1.9\")\nprint(\"C) 3\")\nprint(\"D) 1.2\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated minimum redshift of {z_min:.3f} is closest to 1.9.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct option is B.\")\n\n```",
    "The code estimated the minimum redshift required for the Lyman-alpha line (rest wavelength 1216 Å) to be observable by a ground-based optical telescope. The calculation was based on the atmospheric cutoff, which prevents wavelengths shorter than approximately 3500 Å from reaching the ground.\n\nUsing the cosmological redshift formula, `z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1`, the minimum redshift was calculated as `z_min = (3500 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.878`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the value 1.878 is closest to 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
