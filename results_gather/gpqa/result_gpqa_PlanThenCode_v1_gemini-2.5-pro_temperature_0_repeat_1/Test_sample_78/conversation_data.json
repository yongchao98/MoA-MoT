    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  **Analyze Product NMR Data:** Interpret the 1H and 13C NMR spectra to determine the functional groups and connectivity of the product molecule (C11H12O).\n2.  **Deduce Product Structure:** Combine the NMR fragments (ketone, p-substituted aromatic ring, two methyl groups, and a disubstituted double bond) to build the exact structure of the product.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction:** Identify the reaction type. The use of a base (DABCO) and heat on an epoxide suggests a base-catalyzed rearrangement.\n4.  **Evaluate Starting Material Options:** Examine the four possible structures for Compound X.\n5.  **Connect Reactant to Product:** Determine which of the proposed starting materials (Compound X) has the correct molecular formula and carbon skeleton to rearrange into the deduced product under the given reaction conditions.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemical identification problem by analyzing NMR data\n    and reaction conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze NMR data to deduce the product structure.\n    # The analysis is performed based on chemical principles.\n\n    # 13C NMR Analysis:\n    # - 197.7 ppm: Ketone C=O.\n    # - 126-145 ppm range (6 signals, two with 2C intensity): Aromatic ring, likely para-substituted.\n    # - 21.3 ppm & 28.4 ppm: Two aliphatic carbons, likely methyl groups.\n    # Total carbons: 1 (C=O) + 6 (Aromatic) + 2 (Aliphatic) + 2 (unaccounted, must be C=C) = 11C.\n\n    # 1H NMR Analysis:\n    # - 7.71 (2H, d) & 7.08 (2H, d): Classic AA'BB' pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    # - 2.31 (3H, s): A methyl group singlet, likely attached to the aromatic ring (p-tolyl group).\n    # - 2.28 (3H, s): A second methyl group singlet, not coupled to any protons.
