    "*   PLAN\n1.  Define the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s.\n2.  Define the lifetimes for the two quantum states, Δt1 and Δt2.\n3.  Apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ) to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, which is the limiting factor for resolution.\n4.  Establish the condition for the energy levels to be clearly resolved: the energy difference between them (|E1 - E2|) must be significantly greater than the larger of the two energy uncertainties.\n5.  Print the calculated minimum energy separation required for resolution.\n6.

    "Based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the energy uncertainty (ΔE) of a quantum state is inversely proportional to its lifetime (Δt), given by ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt.\n\nThe code first calculates the energy uncertainty for each state:\n*   For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁹ s, the energy uncertainty is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁸ s, the energy uncertainty is ΔE₂ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nTo clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in their energy measurements. The limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy uncertainty, which corresponds to the state with the *shorter* lifetime. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than ΔE₁ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nComparing the given options to this requirement:\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two states.\n\n<<<A>>>"
