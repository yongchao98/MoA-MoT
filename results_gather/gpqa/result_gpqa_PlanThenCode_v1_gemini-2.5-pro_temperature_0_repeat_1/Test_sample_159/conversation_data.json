    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Recognize that as the number of sides N of a regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circle with radius `r = a`.\n2.  Identify the problem as Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture, which produces an Airy pattern.\n3.  Recall the formula for the angular positions of the minima in an Airy pattern, which depends on the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J_1(x)`. The formula is `θ_n = (z_n * λ) / (2 * π * a)`, where `z_n` is the n-th zero.\n4.  Define the values for the first (`z_1`) and second (`z_2`) non-zero zeros of the `J_1(x)` Bessel function.\n5.  Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`. This simplifies to `Δθ = (z_2 - z_1) * λ / (2 * π * a)`.\n6.  Compute the numerical coefficient for `λ / a` and compare it to the given options to determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1. As N -> infinity, an N-sided polygon with constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius r = a.\n# The problem is therefore about Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture.\n\n# 2. The diffraction pattern is an Airy pattern. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima)\n# are given by the formula involving the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J1(x).\n# Using the small angle approximation (theta ≈ sin(theta)), the formula is:\n# theta_n = z_n * lambda / (pi * D)\n# where D is the diameter of the aperture and z_n is the n-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# 3. In our case, the radius is 'a', so the diameter D = 2*a.\n# The formula becomes: theta_n = z_n * lambda / (2 * pi * a)\n\n# 4.

    "The code successfully solved the problem by modeling the N-sided polygon with an infinite number of sides as a circular aperture of radius `a`. The diffraction pattern produced is an Airy pattern. The angular positions of the minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J_1(x)`.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima (`θ_2 - θ_1`) was calculated using the formula `Δθ = (z_2 - z_1) * λ / (2 * π * a)`, where `z_1 ≈ 3.8317` and `z_2 ≈ 7.0156` are the first two non-zero roots of `J_1(x)`. The calculation yielded a coefficient of approximately 0.5067 for `λ / a`. Comparing this result to the given options, it most closely matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
