    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the given physical quantities: production energy ($E_X$), mass ($m_X$), and decay width ($\\Gamma_X$). Also, define the necessary physical constant, $\\hbar c$ (hbar-c).\n2.  Ensure all values are in a consistent system of units. We will use Giga-electron Volts (GeV) for energy/mass and meters (m) for distance. This requires converting the width from MeV to GeV.\n3.  Calculate the momentum of the particle, $p_X$, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $(p_X c)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2$.\n4.  Calculate the mean decay distance, $d$, using the formula $d = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$. This formula combines the proper lifetime ($\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma_X$) with the time dilation and velocity effects.\n5.  Print the final calculated distance in scientific notation to compare it with the provided multiple-choice options.\n6.  Identify and state which option (A, B, C, or D) matches the calculated result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the mean decay distance for the X meson resonance.\n\nFirst, it established the given physical parameters: an energy of 8 GeV, a mass of 1.2 GeV, and a decay width of 320 MeV. The decay width was converted to 0.32 GeV to maintain consistent units.\n\nNext, the momentum of the particle was calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, yielding $p_X c \\approx 7.9095$ GeV.\n\nFinally, the mean decay distance was computed using the formula $d = \\frac{p_X c}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$. The calculation resulted in a mean decay distance of approximately $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ meters.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options, it is clear that the calculated value is extremely close to option A, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The minor discrepancy is likely due to the precision of the physical constants used.\n\n<<<A>>>"
