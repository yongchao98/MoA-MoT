    "Here is a plan to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product:\n\n1.  **Determine Product 1:** Identify the reaction of acetic acid with bromine and pyridine as a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which brominates the alpha-carbon, forming bromoacetic acid.\n2.  **Determine Product 2:** Identify the reaction of Product 1 with ethanol and acid as a Fischer esterification, forming ethyl bromoacetate.\n3.  **Determine Product 3:** Identify the reaction of Product 2 with sodium cyanide as an SN2 substitution, forming ethyl cyanoacetate.\n4.  **Determine Final Product 4:** Analyze the reaction of Product 3 with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a double alkylation leading to an intramolecular cyclization, forming 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n5.  **Analyze Symmetry and Count Signals:** Examine the structure of Product 4 for symmetry. Identify the plane of symmetry and determine how many sets of chemically non-equivalent protons exist, remembering that diastereotopic protons (like axial and equatorial protons on a cyclohexane ring) are chemically distinct.\n6.  **Sum the Signals:** Add the number of signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring to find the total number of distinct 1H NMR signals.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically follows the logic to determine the number of\n    distinct 1H NMR signals for the final product of the reaction sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # PLAN STEP 1-4: Determine the structure of the final product.\n    # The reaction sequence is:\n    # 1.

    "The Python script successfully determined the final product of the reaction sequence to be 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. It then analyzed the structure for chemically distinct hydrogen atoms to predict the number of signals in a 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe analysis concluded:\n*   The ethoxycarbonyl group contributes 2 distinct signals (one for the -CH2- and one for the -CH3).\n*   The cyclohexane ring, due to its symmetry and the diastereotopic nature of its axial and equatorial protons, contributes 6 distinct signals (two each for the C2/C6, C3/C5, and C4 positions).\n*   The total number of distinct signals is the sum of these, 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n<<<B>>>"
