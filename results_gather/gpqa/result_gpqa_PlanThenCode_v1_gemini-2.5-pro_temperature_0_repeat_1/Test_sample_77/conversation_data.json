    "**PLAN**\n1.  State the theoretical formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) for a moving point charge, which are derived from Maxwell's equations.\n2.  Represent the four given multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) for easy reference.\n3.  Analyze the key component of the potentials, which is the relativistic denominator term that accounts for the retarded time and the charge's motion. The correct form is `(d*c - d·v)`.\n4.  Compare the theoretical formula's structure, particularly the numerator and the denominator, with each of the provided options.\n5.  Identify the option that correctly matches the established Liénard-Wiechert potential formulas.\n6.  Print the letter corresponding to the correct option and the formulas for clarity.\n\n```python\n# This script programmatically identifies the correct expressions for the\n# Liénard-Wiechert potentials from a list of options based on established theory.\n\n# 1. Theoretical background (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):\n# The scalar potential V and vector potential A for a point charge q moving\n# with velocity v are given by:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) * [q / (d - d·v/c)]_ret\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 / (4 * pi)) * [q*v / (d - d·v/c)]_ret\n# where all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time tr.\n# The vector d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the field point r,\n# and d is its magnitude.\n\n# 2. Simplify the denominator for comparison with the options:\n# The denominator term is d - d·v/c.\n# We can factor out 1/c: (1/c) * (d*c - d·v)\n# Substituting this back into the potential expressions gives:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_0)) * [q*c / (d*c - d·v)]_ret\n# A(r, t) = (mu_0 / (4 * pi)) * [q*c*v / (d*c - d·v)]_ret\n\n# 3. Represent the options provided in the question.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"V = qc/(4πε₀(dc + d·v)), A = μ₀qcv/(4π(dc + d·v))\",\n    \"B\": \"V = q/(4πε₀r), A = (v²/c²)V\",\n    \"C\": \"V = qc/(4πε₀(dc - d·v)), A = μ₀qcv/(4π(dc - d·v))\",\n    \"D\": \"V = q/(4πε₀r), A = (v/c²)V\"\n}\n\n# 4. Analysis of the options:\n# Option A: The denominator has (dc + d·v). The sign is incorrect; it should be a minus.\n# Option B: V is the static Coulomb potential, which is incorrect for a general moving charge as it ignores retardation. The relation between A and V is also incorrect.\n# Option C: The expression for V has the numerator proportional to qc and the denominator (dc - d·v). The expression for A has the numerator proportional to μ₀qcv and the same denominator. This perfectly matches the derived theoretical form.\n# Option D: V is the static potential, which is incorrect. While the relation A = (v/c²)V is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n\n# 5.
