    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Import the `numpy` library to handle matrix and vector operations.\n2.  Define the matrix for the operator $P_z$ and the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ as NumPy arrays. For simplicity in calculation, we will set the constant $\\hbar=1$.\n3.  Calculate the expectation value of $P_z$, which is given by the formula $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi$.\n4.  Calculate the expectation value of $P_z^2$. This requires first finding the matrix for $P_z^2$ by squaring the $P_z$ matrix, and then calculating $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi$.\n5.  Use the calculated expectation values to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ using the formula $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$.\n6.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the uncertainty in the $P_z$ operator for the given quantum state.\n\nThe script followed these steps:\n1.  It defined the matrix for the operator $P_z$ and the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n2.  It calculated the expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, which resulted in $0$.\n3.  It calculated the expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$, which resulted in $0.5 \\hbar^2$.\n4.  Using the uncertainty principle formula, $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$, the uncertainty was computed.\n5.  The final uncertainty was found to be $\\sqrt{0.5 \\hbar^2 - 0^2} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\hbar \\approx 0.7071 \\hbar$.\n\nThis numerical result corresponds to $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
