    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define variables for the given parameters of system 1: its period (P1) and the radial velocity amplitudes of its two stars (K1a, K1b).\n2.  Define variables for the given parameters of system 2: its period (P2) and the radial velocity amplitudes of its two stars (K2a, K2b).\n3.  Calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes for each system (K_total_1 and K_total_2).\n4.  Use the relationship for eclipsing binary systems, where the total mass (M) is proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes: M ∝ P * (K_total)³.\n5.

    "The code successfully calculated the mass ratio of system 1 to system 2. It first determined the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes for each system (15 km/s for system 1 and 25 km/s for system 2). Then, using the relationship that the total mass of a binary system is proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (M ∝ P * K_total³), it computed the ratio M1/M2. The final calculated ratio was approximately 0.432, which corresponds most closely to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
