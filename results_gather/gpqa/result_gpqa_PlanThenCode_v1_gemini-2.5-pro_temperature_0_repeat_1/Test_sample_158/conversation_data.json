    "Here is a plan to determine the comoving distance to the quasar:\n\n1.  **Calculate Redshift (z):** The significant drop in flux below 790 nm is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha break. We will use the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition (121.6 nm) and the observed wavelength (790 nm) to calculate the quasar's redshift using the formula `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`.\n2.  **Define Cosmological Model:** We will set up the constants for the specified Lambda-CDM model: Hubble constant `H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc`, matter density `Ω_m = 0.3`, and dark energy density `Ω_Λ = 0.7`. We also need the speed of light, `c`.\n3.  **Formulate the Comoving Distance Integral:** The comoving distance `D_C` in a flat universe is calculated by integrating over redshift. The formula is `D_C = (c/H₀) * ∫[0 to z] dz' / E(z')`, where `E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z')³ + Ω_Λ)`.\n4.  **Perform Numerical Integration:** We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically solve the integral for the calculated redshift `z`.\n5.  **Calculate and Compare:** We will compute the final comoving distance, convert it from Megaparsecs (Mpc) to Gigaparsecs (Gpc), and print the result to compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Calculate Redshift (z)\nlambda_obs = 790.0  # Observed wavelength in nm\nlambda_rest = 121.6 # Rest-frame Lyman-alpha wavelength in nm\nz = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# 2.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the comoving distance to the quasar based on the provided cosmological parameters and observational data.\n\nFirst, the redshift of the quasar was determined to be `z ≈ 5.5` by identifying the flux drop at 790 nm as the Lyman-alpha break (rest-frame wavelength 121.6 nm).\n\nNext, using the specified Lambda-CDM model (`H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc`, `Ω_m = 0.3`, `Ω_Λ = 0.7`), the script numerically integrated the comoving distance formula up to the calculated redshift.\n\nThe final calculated comoving distance was approximately **8.02 Gpc**. Comparing this result to the given options, it is closest to 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
