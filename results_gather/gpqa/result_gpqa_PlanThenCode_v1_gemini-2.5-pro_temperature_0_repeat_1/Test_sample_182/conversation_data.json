    "Here is a plan to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the reaction product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:** Recognize that red phosphorus with excess HI is a powerful reducing agent that converts all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon double bonds into saturated alkanes.\n3.  **Determine the Product:** Deduce the structure and molecular formula of the final product after complete reduction. The carbon skeleton will be preserved, but all unsaturations (double bonds) and functional groups will be reduced.\n4.  **Calculate IHD:** Use the molecular formula of the product to calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n5.  **Output the Result:** Print the steps of the deduction and the final calculated IHD, then identify the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product\n    obtained from the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # PLAN\n    # 1.

    "The code successfully determined the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reaction product.\n\nThe starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, undergoes complete reduction with red phosphorus and excess HI. This powerful reducing agent converts all functional groups (carboxylic acid, aldehyde) and unsaturations (C=C double bonds) into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\nThe initial molecule has 10 carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with the molecular formula C10H20.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency was calculated using the formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of one ring, which is consistent with the final product being a substituted cyclohexane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
