    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature, which depends on the star's properties and the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n2.  Determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2). This simplifies to a function of the ratio of their semi-major axes (`sqrt(a2 / a1)`).\n3.  Relate the semi-major axis (`a`) to the observable quantities. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is proportional to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`1/sqrt(a)`).\n4.  Use the relationship between the Doppler shift (`Δλ`) and the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) to express the ratio of semi-major axes in terms of the planet masses and Doppler shifts.\n5.  Substitute the given values for planet masses and Doppler shifts into the derived final formula: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`.\n6.  Calculate the final numerical ratio and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN:\n# 1. Define the given values for the masses of the two planets and their Doppler shifts.\n# 2.

    "The code successfully calculated the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (`T_eq ∝ 1/√a`). The semi-major axis can be related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and its induced radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) by `a ∝ (M_p/K)²`. Since the radial velocity is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift (`K ∝ Δλ`), the relationship can be expressed as `a ∝ (M_p/Δλ)²`.\n\nCombining these relationships, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂/a₁) = √((M_p2/Δλ₂)² / (M_p1/Δλ₁)²)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\nUsing the given values:\n`M_p1 = 7 M_Earth`\n`M_p2 = 5 M_Earth`\n`Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å`\n`Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å`\n\nThe calculation performed by the script is:\n`Ratio = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
