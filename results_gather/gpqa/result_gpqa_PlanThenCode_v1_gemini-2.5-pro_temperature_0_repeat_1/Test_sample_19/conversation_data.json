Evaluate each of the four listed assumptions against the definition of the impulse approximation.\n4.  Identify the set of assumptions (1, 2, and 4) that are essential for this approximation. Assumption 3 is about the internal structure of the nucleon, not its interaction within the nucleus.\n5.

    "The Python script successfully analyzed the four assumptions related to the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. It correctly identified that the approximation relies on three key ideas:\n\n1.  The interaction involves only a single nucleon at a time, ignoring multi-nucleon effects.\n2.  The incoming and outgoing particles do not interact with the rest of the nucleus (final/initial state interactions are ignored).\n3.  The interaction is so rapid that the nucleon's binding energy is negligible during the event.\n\nThe script correctly determined that the assumption about the internal quark structure of the nucleon (Assumption 3) is not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation itself. Therefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
