    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Identify the primary reactant, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, as an enol functional group.\n2.  Explain the chemical principle of keto-enol tautomerism, where the enol is in equilibrium with its more stable keto form.\n3.  Identify the corresponding keto tautomer, which is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n4.  Describe the reaction between the ketone and bromine (Br₂) as an alpha-halogenation, where bromine substitutes a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n5.  Determine the structure of the final product by identifying the alpha-carbon and adding the bromine atom.\n6.  Compare the predicted product with the given multiple-choice options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine\n    to determine the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of the reaction:\")\n    print(\"1.

    "The Python script analyzed the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. It correctly identified that the starting enol is unstable and will tautomerize to its more stable keto form, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The reaction then proceeds as an alpha-halogenation of this ketone, where a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). This results in the formation of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
