    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define constants for the rest mass energies of the pion (`m_pi_c2`) and the muon (`m_mu_c2`) in units of MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless.\n2.  Apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum for the decay of a stationary particle into two products.\n3.  Derive and calculate the momentum (`p`) of the product particles. It's convenient to calculate the quantity `pc` (momentum times the speed of light), which has units of energy. The formula is `pc = (m_pi_c2^2 - m_mu_c2^2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)`.\n4.  The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino (`KE_nu`) is equal to its total energy, which is `pc`.\n5.  Calculate the total energy of the muon (`E_mu`) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + m_mu_c2^2)`.\n6.  Determine the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) by subtracting its rest mass energy from its total energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2`. Print the final results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN\n# 1. Define the rest mass energies of the pion (m_pi_c2) and the muon (m_mu_c2) in MeV.\n# 2.

    "The Python script calculated the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino resulting from the decay of a stationary pion. Based on the conservation of energy and momentum, the kinetic energy of the muon was found to be 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino was found to be 29.78 MeV. These values correspond to option C, which lists the kinetic energies as 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV (rounding the neutrino's energy).\n\n<<<C>>>"
