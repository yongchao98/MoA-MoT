    "PLAN:\n1.  Define the predicted 1H NMR signals (integration values for aromatic and aliphatic protons) for each of the four candidate molecules based on their chemical structure and symmetry. All signals are singlets unless otherwise noted.\n2.  Store these predictions in a Python dictionary for easy access, mapping compound names to their spectral data.\n3.  Define the target spectrum based on the problem description for a 1:1 mixture:\n    *   Aromatic region: Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n4.  Represent the options (A, B, C, D) as pairs of compound names.\n5.  Iterate through each option. For each pair of compounds, combine their individual predicted signals to simulate the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture.\n6.  Compare the simulated spectrum for each option against the target spectrum.
