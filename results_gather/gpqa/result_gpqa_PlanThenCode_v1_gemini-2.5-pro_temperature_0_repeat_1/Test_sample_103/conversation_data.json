    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Establish Proportionality:** Recognize that the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ).\n2.  **Derive the Key Relationship:** Use the principles of orbital mechanics (conservation of momentum) and Kepler's Third Law to derive the relationship between the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) and the planet's orbital period (P). For constant star and planet masses, this relationship is K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³.\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** Express the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂/P₁) in terms of the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K₂/K₁). This will be P₂/P₁ = (K₁/K₂)³.\n4.  **Substitute Values:** Since K is proportional to Δλ, substitute the given wavelength shift values (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂) into the ratio: P₂/P₁ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³.\n5.  **Calculate and Print:** Compute the final numerical value for the ratio and print it, comparing it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN\n# 1.

    "The code successfully calculated the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1.\n\nThe solution is based on the relationship derived from orbital mechanics for the radial velocity method. For constant star and planet masses, the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's orbital period (P) by K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³. Since the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to K, it follows that P ∝ (Δλ)⁻³.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the periods is P₂/P₁ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³. Using the given values of Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ and Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ, the calculation yields (5/7)³, which is approximately 0.36. This result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
