    "The Python script successfully analyzed the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peaks at m/z 156 and 158 in a ~3:1 ratio confirmed the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ for all options.\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:** The broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicated the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, narrowing the possibilities to options B and C.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The signal at 11.0 ppm confirmed the carboxylic acid proton. Crucially, the two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a definitive sign of a 1,4- (para) substituted benzene ring. This pattern is only consistent with 4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option B).\n\nThe combined evidence from all three spectroscopic methods points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
