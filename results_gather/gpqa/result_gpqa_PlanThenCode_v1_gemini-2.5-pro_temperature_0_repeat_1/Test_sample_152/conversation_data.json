    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  **Analyze Reaction A:** Identify the Michael donor (dimethyl malonate) and acceptor (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). Determine the structure of the product (A) resulting from the conjugate addition of the malonate enolate to the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n2.  **Name Product A:** Determine the correct IUPAC name for the resulting structure, comparing it to the options provided. The key is identifying the correct carbon backbone for naming.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction B:** This is a Stork enamine synthesis. Identify the enamine (nucleophile) and the α,β-unsaturated acceptor. Determine the structure of the intermediate iminium salt and the final keto product (B) after acidic hydrolysis.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction C:** This is a retrosynthesis problem. Given the product and the Michael acceptor (but-3-en-2-one), identify the bond formed during the reaction.
