    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify Compound A (C3H6) as propene, as it readily undergoes the described addition and subsequent reactions leading to an aromatic system.\n2.  Trace the reaction sequence step-by-step to identify each compound from B to H.\n    *   A (Propene) + Br2/CCl4 → B (1,2-Dibromopropane)\n    *   B + alc. KOH → C (Propyne)\n    *   C (Propyne) passed through red-hot iron tube → D (1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene / Mesitylene)\n    *   D + conc. HNO3/H2SO4 → E (2,4,6-Trimethylnitrobenzene)\n    *   E + Fe/HCl → F (2,4,6-Trimethylaniline / Mesidine)\n    *   F + HNO2 → G (2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt)\n    *   G + NaOH/H2O → H (2,4,6-Trimethylphenol)\n3.  Evaluate statement A by analyzing the structure of compound D (Mesitylene) and predicting its 1H NMR spectrum based on chemical equivalence and symmetry.\n4.  Evaluate statement B by recalling the standard chemical test for phenols (like compound H) using ferric chloride solution.\n5.  Evaluate statement C by considering the common industrial applications of aromatic amines like compound F.\n6.  Evaluate statement D by determining the physical properties (state at room temperature, flammability) of compound C (propyne).\n7.
