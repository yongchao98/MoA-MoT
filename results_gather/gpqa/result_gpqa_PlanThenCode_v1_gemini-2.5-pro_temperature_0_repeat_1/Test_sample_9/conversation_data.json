Use a simplified mass-radius relationship for rocky planets (Radius is proportional to Mass^0.27) to estimate the radii for planets (c) and (d).\n5.

    "The code successfully calculated and compared the densities of the four hypothetical exoplanets.\n\n*   **Planet (a)**, being identical to Earth, has a density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   **Planet (b)** was given a density of 5.50 g/cm³.\n*   **Planet (c)**, with 5 times Earth's mass but the same composition, experiences significant gravitational compression. This increases its density to an estimated 7.48 g/cm³.\n*   **Planet (d)**, with half of Earth's mass, is less compressed by gravity, resulting in a lower density of approximately 4.83 g/cm³.\n\nComparing the results, planet (c) has the highest density due to its large mass causing greater self-compression.\n\n<<<B>>>"
