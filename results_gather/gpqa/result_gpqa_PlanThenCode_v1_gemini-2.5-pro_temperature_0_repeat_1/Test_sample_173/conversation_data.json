Define the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus (M) and the fraction of this mass that constitutes the sum of the fragments' rest-masses. All energies will be handled in GeV.\n    2.  From the given mass relationships (`m1 = 2*m2` and `m1 + m2 = 0.99*M`), calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m1_E` and `m2_E`).\n    3.  Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q) released, which is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n    4.  Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_classical`) using the classical approximation, where kinetic energy is distributed inversely to the mass ratio (`T1/T2 = m2/m1`).\n    5.  Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_relativistic`) by solving the equations for conservation of energy and momentum.\n    6.

    "The code successfully calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using both classical and relativistic mechanics.\n\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The initial nucleus had a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. The two fragments had rest-mass energies of 198 GeV (massive fragment, m1) and 99 GeV (lighter fragment, m2). The total kinetic energy released was 3 GeV.\n*   **Classical Calculation:** The classical kinetic energy for the massive fragment (T1_classical) was calculated to be 1.0 GeV.\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct relativistic kinetic energy for the massive fragment (T1_relativistic) was calculated to be 1.005 GeV.\n*   **Final Result:** The difference between the relativistic and classical values is 1.005 GeV - 1.0 GeV = 0.005 GeV. Converting this to MeV (by multiplying by 1000) yields 5 MeV.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
