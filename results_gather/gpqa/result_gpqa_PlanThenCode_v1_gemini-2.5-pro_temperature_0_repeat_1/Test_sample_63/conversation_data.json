Define constants for molar masses and STP molar volume. Calculate the moles of the gaseous products (H₂O, O₂, and the remaining gas C) from the given experimental data.\n2.  Deduce that gas C is N₂ by checking the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of H₂O, O₂, and N₂ should equal the initial 7.20 g.\n3.  Based on the products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) and the fact that the reactants are salts that decompose completely into gases, hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n4.  Write the balanced decomposition equations for these salts. Use the stoichiometry and the calculated moles of O₂ to determine the number of moles `n` of each salt in the initial equimolar mixture.\n5.  Verify that the calculated `n` is consistent with the amounts of the other products and the total initial mass.\n6.  Calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₂ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₃, sum them, and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the stoichiometry problem to find the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n    \"\"\"\n    # PLAN 1: Define constants and calculate moles of products.\n    # The mass increase in tube #1 (Mg(ClO4)2) is due to H2O absorption.\n    mass_h2o = 3.60  # g\n    # The mass increase in tube #3 (hot Cu) is due to reaction with O2 (2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO).\n    # The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen gas.\n    mass_o2 = 0.80  # g\n    # The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 L at STP.\n    volume_gas_c_stp = 2.24  # L\n    # Total initial mass of the salt mixture.\n    mass_mixture = 7.20 # g\n\n    # Molar masses (g/mol)\n    M_H2O = 18.0\n    M_O2 = 32.0\n    M_N2 = 28.0\n    # Molar volume at STP (L/mol)\n    V_m_stp = 22.4\n\n    # Calculate moles of known products\n    moles_h2o = mass_h2o / M_H2O\n    moles_o2 = mass_o2 / M_O2\n    moles_gas_c = volume_gas_c_stp / V_m_stp\n    \n    print(f\"Calculated moles of H2O: {moles_h2o:.3f} mol\")\n    print(f\"Calculated moles of O2: {moles_o2:.3f} mol\")\n    print(f\"Calculated moles of Gas C: {moles_gas_c:.3f} mol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # PLAN 2: Identify Gas C by checking mass conservation.\n    # The absence of reaction in tube #2 (Ca(OH)2) means no acidic gases (like CO2).\n    # The remaining gas C is inert to all reagents, suggesting it is N2.\n    mass_gas_c_assumed_n2 = moles_gas_c * M_N2\n    total_mass_products = mass_h2o + mass_o2 + mass_gas_c_assumed_n2\n    print(f\"Assuming Gas C is N2, its mass is: {mass_gas_c_assumed_n2:.2f} g\")\n    print(f\"Total mass of products (H2O + O2 + N2): {total_mass_products:.2f} g\")\n    print(f\"Initial mass of mixture: {mass_mixture:.2f} g\")\n    print(\"Mass is conserved, confirming Gas C is N2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # PLAN 3 & 4: Hypothesize salts and determine their molar amounts.\n    # The products (N2, O2, H2O) and complete decomposition suggest a mixture of ammonium salts.\n    # A plausible pair is Ammonium Nitrite (A) and Ammonium Nitrate (B).\n    # Reaction A: NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2H2O\n    # Reaction B: 2NH4NO3 -> 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O\n    # Let 'n' be the moles of each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n    # Only reaction B produces O2.

    "The python code successfully identified the gaseous products and their molar quantities from the experimental data. The products are 0.200 mol of water (H₂O), 0.025 mol of oxygen (O₂), and 0.100 mol of nitrogen (N₂). The total mass of these products is 7.20 g, confirming the law of conservation of mass.\n\nBased on these products, the code correctly deduced that the two salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The decomposition reactions are:\nSalt A: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\nSalt B: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe code correctly determined that the initial equimolar mixture contained 0.05 mol of each salt. A minor typo (`predicted_mles_n2` instead of `predicted_moles_n2`) caused a `NameError`, but all the necessary calculations to identify the salts and their quantities were completed successfully before this point.\n\nThe final step is to count the atoms in one formula unit of each salt:\n-   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n-   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
