    "PLAN\n1.  Identify the reaction as a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n2.  Apply the 'endo rule', which predicts the kinetically favored product. This rule states that the dienophile's substituents (the anhydride ring) will be oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system.\n3.  Apply the rule for facial selectivity. The dienophile will approach the diene from the face *anti* (opposite) to the substituent on the C5 carbon (the fluorine atom) to minimize steric hindrance.\n4.  Combine these two rules to determine the overall stereochemistry of the major product: it will be the *endo, anti* adduct.\n5.  Translate the predicted *endo, anti* stereochemistry into the correct IUPAC name by analyzing the stereodescriptors (R/S and r/s) in the given options. The *anti* position of the fluorine corresponds to `8s`, and the *endo* configuration corresponds to `(4S,7R)` for the given enantiomeric series.\n6.

    "The Python script successfully determined the major product of the Diels-Alder reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride.\n\nThe analysis correctly identified two key stereochemical principles:\n1.  **The Endo Rule:** The reaction favors the *endo* product due to kinetic control and stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n2.  **Facial Selectivity:** The dienophile approaches from the face *anti* to the fluorine atom to minimize steric hindrance.\n\nCombining these principles, the major product is the *endo, anti* adduct. The script then correctly matched this stereochemistry to the IUPAC name provided in option A, which has the `8s` descriptor for the *anti*-fluorine and the `(4S,7R)` descriptors for the *endo*-anhydride ring.\n\n<<<A>>>"
