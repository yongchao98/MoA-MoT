    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  **Step 1: A** Trace the reaction of propionaldehyde with ethanedithiol (EDT) and a BF3 catalyst to determine the structure of product A. This is a thioacetal protection of the aldehyde.\n2.  **Step 2: B & C** Determine the product of deprotonating A with butyllithium (BuLi) to form B, followed by an SN2 reaction with bromoethane to form product C. This sequence results in alkylation at the carbon alpha to the two sulfur atoms.\n3.  **Step 3: D** Determine the product of the deprotection of thioacetal C using HgCl2, H2O, and H+. This reaction regenerates a carbonyl group, yielding product D.\n4.  **Step 4: E** Determine the final product E from the Wittig reaction of ketone D with the ylide formed from 3-bromopentane, PPh3, and BuLi.\n5.  **Step 5: NMR Analysis** Analyze the chemical structure of the final product E for symmetry. Count the number of unique carbon environments to determine the number of 13C-NMR signals.\n6.  **Step 6: Final Answer** Print the step-by-step derivation and the final count of NMR signals, which corresponds to one of the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the multi-step synthesis problem and determines the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A\n    print(\"1.
