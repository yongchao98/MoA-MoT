    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the given constants: the stability constants (β1, β2, β3, β4) and the ligand concentration ([SCN-]).\n2.  Calculate the denominator of the distribution fraction formula. This term, often called the degree of complex formation (Φ) or sum (S), is calculated as `S = 1 + β1*[SCN-]^1 + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4`.\n3.  Calculate the numerator for the desired species, which is the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2]. The term is `β2 * [SCN-]^2`.\n4.  Compute the fraction (α2) of the dithiocyanato complex by dividing its corresponding term (the numerator) by the total sum (the denominator).\n5.

    "The Python script calculated the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. It used the provided stability constants (β1 to β4) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN-] = 0.1 M).\n\nThe calculation followed the standard formula for species distribution in complexation equilibria:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ * [SCN⁻]ⁱ))\n\nThe script computed the numerator (the term for the target complex) as 0.4000 and the denominator (the sum of terms for all species) as 2.3646. The resulting fraction was approximately 0.1692, which corresponds to 16.9%. This value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
