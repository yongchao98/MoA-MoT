    "*   **PLAN:**\n    1.  Analyze the clue about the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF=31.96%) in compound A2 (formula YFₙ) to establish a relationship between the atomic mass of element Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n): M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    2.  Test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y. For n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol, which strongly suggests element Y is Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's hypothesize Y=Kr and A2=KrF₂.\n    3.  Verify this hypothesis with the other chemical clues. The reaction \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4... A5 can be obtained\" points to a comproportionation. The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂` fits this 1:1 molar ratio requirement perfectly. This identifies A4 as KrF₄.\n    4.  Calculate the molecular weight of the identified compound A4 (KrF₄) using the atomic weights of Krypton and Fluorine.\n    5.  Compare the calculated molecular weight of A4 with the given answer ranges to determine the correct option.\n    6.  Print the reasoning, the calculation, and the final selected range.\n\n```python\n# 1.

    "Based on the chemical clues provided, the unknown element Y was identified as Krypton (Kr). The mass percentage of fluorine (31.96%) in compound A2 corresponds to the formula KrF₂. The subsequent clue describing a 1:1 molar ratio reaction between Y (Kr) and compound A4 to form A5 points to the comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂`. This identifies compound A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) was calculated as follows:\nMW(KrF₄) = MW(Kr) + 4 * MW(F)\nMW(KrF₄) = 83.80 g/mol + 4 * 19.00 g/mol = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>"
