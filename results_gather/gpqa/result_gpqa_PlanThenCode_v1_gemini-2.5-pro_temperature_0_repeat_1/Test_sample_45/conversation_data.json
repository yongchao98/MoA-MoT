    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Identify the reactant: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, a 50/50 mixture of (R)- and (S)-enantiomers.\n2.  Identify the reaction: Olefin self-metathesis with Grubbs catalyst, which dimerizes the alkene, excluding the terminal CH2 group. The general product structure will be 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n3.  Consider the three possible reaction pairings in the racemic mixture: (R) + (R), (S) + (S), and (R) + (S).\n4.  For each pairing, analyze the stereochemistry of the resulting product. This includes the two original chiral centers and the new C=C double bond, which can have E or Z geometry.\n5.  Sum the number of unique stereoisomers produced from all possible pairings.\n6.

    "The Python script analyzed the self-metathesis reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. The reactant is a 50/50 mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers. The analysis considered the three possible reaction pairings:\n\n1.  **(R) + (R):** This homodimerization produces two chiral diastereomers, (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene and (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n2.  **(S) + (S):** This homodimerization produces the two enantiomers of the first pair, (E)-(3S,6S) and (Z)-(3S,6S).\n3.  **(R) + (S):** This cross-dimerization produces two achiral (meso) diastereomers, (E)-(3R,6S) and (Z)-(3R,6S).\n\nSumming the unique products from each pairing (2 + 2 + 2) gives a total of 6 possible stereoisomeric products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
