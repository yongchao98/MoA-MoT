    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define all the given constants: masses, molar masses, volume, and the dissociation constants (Ka values).\n2.  Calculate the number of moles for both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O by dividing their respective masses by their molar masses.\n3.  Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the H2PO4- ion (from KH2PO4) and the HPO4^2- ion (from Na2HPO4●2H2O) by dividing their moles by the solution volume in liters.\n4.  Use the second dissociation equilibrium (H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-) and its constant (Ka2) to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]. The formula is [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-].\n5.  Use the third dissociation equilibrium (HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-) and its constant (Ka3) to calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-].

    "The code successfully calculated the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO4^3-]) in the buffer solution.\n\nFirst, it determined the initial molar concentrations of the two primary species in the buffer: H2PO4- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4●2H2O), which were found to be 0.03674 M and 0.02809 M, respectively.\n\nUsing the second dissociation constant (Ka2) for phosphoric acid, the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] was calculated to be 8.109x10^-8 M.\n\nFinally, using the third dissociation constant (Ka3) and the previously calculated values for [H+] and [HPO4^2-], the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] was determined to be 6.236x10^-7 M. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
