    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Identify the product of the first reaction: nitration of toluene. The major product is para-nitrotoluene.\n2.  Identify the product of the second reaction: oxidation of the methyl group on para-nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid, forming para-nitrobenzoic acid.\n3.  Identify the product of the third reaction: deprotonation of para-nitrobenzoic acid by sodium hydroxide to form the 4-nitrobenzoate anion.\n4.  Analyze the structure of the 4-nitrobenzoate anion to find its symmetry elements (axes of rotation, mirror planes, center of inversion).\n5.  Determine the molecular point group based on the collection of identified symmetry elements.\n6.  Match the determined point group to the given options and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script determines the molecular symmetry group of a molecule produced in a 3-step synthesis.\n# All output is generated via print statements.\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the multi-step chemistry problem by identifying the final product\n    and determining its molecular symmetry point group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Reaction of toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid\n    print(\"--- Reaction 1 ---\")\n    print(\"Reactant: Toluene (a benzene ring with a -CH3 group)\")\n    print(\"Reagents: Nitric acid (HNO3) and Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)\")\n    print(\"Reaction Type: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration)\")\n    print(\"The -CH3 group is an ortho-, para-director.

    "The code successfully executed the planned steps to solve the chemical problem.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1**: Toluene was nitrated with nitric and sulfuric acid, correctly identifying the major product as para-nitrotoluene.\n2.  **Reaction 2**: The methyl group of para-nitrotoluene was oxidized by MnO2 and H2SO4 to a carboxylic acid, forming para-nitrobenzoic acid.\n3.  **Reaction 3**: The para-nitrobenzoic acid was treated with sodium hydroxide, which deprotonated the acid to form the 4-nitrobenzoate anion.\n4.  **Symmetry Analysis**: The final product, the 4-nitrobenzoate anion, was analyzed. It was found to possess a principal C2 axis, two perpendicular C2 axes, a center of inversion, and three mirror planes.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The combination of these symmetry elements correctly identifies the molecular point group as D2h, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
