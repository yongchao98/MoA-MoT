    "**PLAN**\n1.  Define the chemical equilibrium for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex: `Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻`.\n2.  Write the expression for the formation constant, `K_f = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])`.\n3.  Set up the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. At equilibrium, `[Ca²⁺] = x`, `[EDTA⁴⁻] = x`, and `[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x`.\n4.  Simplify the equilibrium expression by assuming that 'x' is negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M) because the formation constant `K_f` is very large. The expression becomes `K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²`.\n5.  Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n6.  Calculate the value of 'x' using Python and print the result to identify the correct multiple-choice answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN\n# 1. Define the constants: initial concentration of Ca-EDTA and the formation constant (Kf).\nC_complex_initial = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10\n\n# 2. Set up the equilibrium expression.\n# The reaction is Ca-EDTA <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ at equilibrium.\n# Then [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x.\n# The formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).\n# So, Kf = (0.02 - x) / (x * x).\n\n# 3. Simplify the expression.\n# Because Kf is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so x << 0.02.\n# We can approximate (0.02 - x) as 0.02.\n# The simplified equation is Kf ≈ 0.02 / x^2.\n\n# 4. Solve for x.\n# Rearranging the formula: x^2 ≈ 0.02 / Kf\nx_squared = C_complex_initial / Kf\n# Take the square root to find x\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# 5. Print the final calculated concentration.\nprint(f\"Initial [Ca-EDTA] = {C_complex_initial} M\")\nprint(f\"Formation Constant (Kf) = {Kf:.1e}\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions is calculated to be: {x:.2e} M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"B) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"C) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(\"D) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(\"The calculated value matches option D.\")\n\n```",
    "The code successfully calculated the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions (`Ca²⁺`) from a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe calculation was based on the dissociation equilibrium `Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻` and its very large formation constant, `K_f = 5x10¹⁰`. By setting up the equilibrium expression `K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²`, where `x` is the concentration of `Ca²⁺`, the code solved for `x`.\n\nThe calculated concentration of `Ca²⁺` was `6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M`, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
