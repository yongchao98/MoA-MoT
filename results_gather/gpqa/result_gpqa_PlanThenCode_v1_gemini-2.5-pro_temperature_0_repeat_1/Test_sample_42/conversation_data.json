    "PLAN:\n1.  Identify the principal functional group (carboxylic acid) and the parent structure (benzoic acid), assigning the carboxyl group to position C1.\n2.  Translate the relative position descriptions (ortho, meta, para) into two possible substitution patterns on the benzene ring, as the description is ambiguous enough to allow for two structures.\n3.  Apply the IUPAC numbering rule for breaking ties when locant sets are identical. This rule prioritizes giving the lowest number to the substituent that appears first in alphabetical order.\n4.  Determine the alphabetically first substituent (\"cyano\") and identify which of the two possible structures assigns it the lower locant. This will be the correct structure.\n5.  Construct the full IUPAC name for the correct structure by listing all substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number.\n6.  Compare the constructed name against the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer and print the corresponding letter.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct IUPAC name for a substituted benzene molecule\n    based on a detailed description and IUPAC naming conventions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the molecular description and identify substituents.\")\n    # The parent structure is benzoic acid, with -COOH at C1.\n    # Substituents are: cyano (-CN), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), formyl (-CHO), hydroxy (-OH), methoxy (-OCH3).\n    # Alphabetical order of prefixes: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n    alpha_order = ['cyano', 'dimethylamino', 'formyl', 'hydroxy', 'methoxy']\n    print(f\"Substituents in alphabetical order: {', '.join(alpha_order)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Deduce the two possible structures fitting the description.\")\n    # Constraint summary:\n    # - COOH at C1.\n    # - CHO, CN are at C3 and C5.\n    # - OCH3 is at C4.\n    # - OH, N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6.\n    # - Key tie-breaker: OH is ortho to CN.\n\n    # Structure A: Assume CN is at C5.

    "The Python script successfully determined the correct IUPAC name by following a logical, step-by-step process based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, making the parent molecule benzoic acid, with the carboxyl carbon designated as C1.\n2.  **Substituent Placement:** The script translated the relative positions (ortho, meta, para) into two possible substitution patterns. Both patterns had the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **IUPAC Tie-Breaking:** To decide between the two possibilities, the script applied the IUPAC rule that requires assigning the lowest possible locant to the substituent cited first in the name (i.e., the first one alphabetically).\n4.  **Name Construction:** The substituents in alphabetical order are cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, and methoxy. The script correctly identified that \"cyano\" must be given the lowest possible number, which is 3. This fixed the positions of all other groups.\n5.  **Final Result:** The resulting name, 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, was constructed and matched with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
