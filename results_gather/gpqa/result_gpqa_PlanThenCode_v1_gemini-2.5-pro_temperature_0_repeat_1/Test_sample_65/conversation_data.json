    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Define a dictionary to store information about each symmetry: its name, whether it's required in SMEFT, and a brief justification.\n2.  Explain Lorentz/Poincare symmetry: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, so its Lagrangian and operators must be invariant under Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations (Poincare group).\n3.  Explain CP symmetry: The Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry. SMEFT parameterizes new physics, which can also violate CP, so it is not a required symmetry for all operators.\n4.  Explain CPT symmetry: The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory is CPT invariant. SMEFT is constructed as such a theory, so it must respect CPT.\n5.  Iterate through the defined symmetries and print the analysis for each one.\n6.  Based on the analysis, identify the correct combination of required symmetries (1, 2, and 4) and print the corresponding option letter.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_smeft_symmetries():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the\n    Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and prints the conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    symmetries = {\n        1: {\n            \"name\": \"Lorentz Symmetry\",\n            \"required\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory.

    "The code successfully analyzed the fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The analysis confirmed the following:\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry (1, 2):** As a relativistic effective field theory, SMEFT must be invariant under the Poincare group, which includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. This is a foundational requirement.\n*   **CP Symmetry (3):** CP is violated in the Standard Model itself. SMEFT is designed to parameterize potential new physics, which can also introduce new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.\n*   **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem is a robust consequence of any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is constructed within this framework, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
