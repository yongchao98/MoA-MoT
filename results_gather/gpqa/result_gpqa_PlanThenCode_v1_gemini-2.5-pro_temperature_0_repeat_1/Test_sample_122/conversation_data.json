    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the necessary physical constants and given values: the speed of light (c), the relative velocity of the ejecta (v), and the time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time, Δt').\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which quantifies the magnitude of relativistic effects, using the formula γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n3.  Apply the time dilation formula to find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt). The formula is Δt = γ * Δt'.\n4.

    "The code successfully calculated the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame by applying the principles of special relativity.\n\nFirst, it determined the Lorentz factor (γ) to be approximately 1.0206, based on the ejecta's velocity of 60,000 km/s (which is 0.2 times the speed of light).\n\nNext, it used this factor to calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (time dilation). While 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, approximately 51.03 seconds passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nFinally, it calculated the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame by multiplying the ejecta's velocity by the dilated time (60,000 km/s * 51.03 s), resulting in a distance of approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option C (3,060,000 km).\n\n<<<C>>>"
