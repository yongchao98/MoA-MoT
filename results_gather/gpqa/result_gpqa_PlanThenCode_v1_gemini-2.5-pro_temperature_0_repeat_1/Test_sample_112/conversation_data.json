    "*   PLAN\n1.  Define a function to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a given chemical formula. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n2.  Analyze the provided spectroscopic data to identify key functional groups.\n3.  From the FTIR data, the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicate a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests a C=C double bond (alkene).\n4.  From the ¹H NMR data, the presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the C=C double bond.\n5.  From the Mass Spectrometry data, the fragment at m/z = 45 is characteristic of the [COOH]+ fragment, confirming the carboxylic acid.\n6.  Based on the analysis, the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid, one for the C=C alkene).

    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as follows:\n\n1.  **FTIR & Mass Spectrometry:** The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 all strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This requires the molecule to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **FTIR & ¹H NMR:** The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the presence of vinyl-hydrogens in the NMR spectrum confirm a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The presence of a carboxylic acid (which contains a C=O double bond) and an alkene (C=C double bond) means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nThe code evaluated the candidate formulas based on these deductions:\n*   **C6H10O2 (A):** Has 2 oxygens and a DoU of 2 (C + 1 - H/2 = 6 + 1 - 10/2 = 2). This matches all criteria.\n*   **C6H12O2 (B):** Has 2 oxygens but a DoU of 1. This is incorrect.\n*   **C6H10O (C):** Has only 1 oxygen.
