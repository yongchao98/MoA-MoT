    "The Python script successfully analyzed the provided spectroscopic data against four possible explanations.\n\n*   **NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The separation into two peaks by LC confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species. The fact that both peaks have the same mass spectrum rules out impurities with different chemical formulas (like precursors or side-products from 'double coupling').\n\nThe analysis correctly concluded:\n*   **Options A and B** are incorrect because they would result in compounds with different masses, which contradicts the MS data.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect because enantiomers are indistinguishable by standard NMR and LC techniques.\n*   **Option C** is the only explanation that fits all observations. Diastereoisomers have the same mass but different physical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC. Their different 3D structures create distinct chemical environments, leading to separate signals in the NMR spectrum. A common example in peptides is the presence of cis/trans rotamers around an amide bond, which are a specific type of diastereoisomer.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
