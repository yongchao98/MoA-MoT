    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Deduce the identity of Substance X by systematically analyzing the chemical clues provided in the riddle. Key clues include its isotopic nature, its violent reaction to produce a specific gas, the properties of the reaction byproducts, and its function as a reducing agent.\n2.  Identify Substance X as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4). The gas (W) is D2, the precipitate (G) is Al(OD)3, and the substance released on heating (B) is D2O, which has a melting point near 277 K.\n3.  Identify the lightest and heaviest elements within the chemical formula of Substance X (LiAlD4). The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n4.  Determine that the lightest element is Hydrogen (represented by Deuterium) and the heaviest element is Aluminium.\n5.  Calculate the total mass contribution from all atoms of the lightest element (four Deuterium atoms) and the heaviest element (one Aluminium atom) in a single formula unit, using integer atomic masses.\n6.  Sum the two calculated masses to find the final cumulative atomic mass and determine the corresponding answer choice.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Deduce the identity of Substance X.\n# The riddle describes a strong deuterated reducing agent.\n# - Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# - It reacts with heavy water (Y=D2O) to produce Deuterium gas (W=D2), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n# - A precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G=Al(OD)3), is formed.\n# - Heating G releases heavy water (B=D2O), whose melting point is ~277 K.\n# - LiAlD4 is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry, capable of reducing a keto acid.\n\n# Step 3: Identify the elements in LiAlD4.\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n# Step 4: Identify the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# Using integer atomic masses for calculation: Li=7, Al=27, D=2.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, mass ~2).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium (mass ~27).\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total mass for the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula unit.\n# The formula is LiAlD4.\nmass_deuterium = 2\nmass_aluminium = 27\n\nnum_deuterium_atoms = 4\nnum_aluminium_atoms = 1\n\ntotal_mass_of_lightest_element = num_deuterium_atoms * mass_deuterium\ntotal_mass_of_heaviest_element = num_aluminium_atoms * mass_aluminium\n\nprint(f\"Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4).\")\nprint(f\"The lightest element is Hydrogen (as Deuterium), and the heaviest is Aluminium.\")\nprint(f\"Total mass of the lightest element's atoms (4 * D): {total_mass_of_lightest_element}\")\nprint(f\"Total mass of the heaviest element's atoms (1 * Al): {total_mass_of_heaviest_element}\")\n\n# Step 6: Sum the masses.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_of_lightest_element + total_mass_of_heaviest_element\nprint(f\"The cumulative atomic mass is the sum: {total_mass_of_lightest_element} + {total_mass_of_heaviest_element} = {cumulative_mass}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n```",
    "Based on the chemical clues, Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4). The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n\nThe lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, with an atomic mass of approximately 2). The heaviest element is Aluminium (with an atomic mass of approximately 27).\n\nThe calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the formula unit:\n-   Mass of all lightest element atoms (4 Deuterium atoms): 4 * 2 = 8\n-   Mass of all heaviest element atoms (1 Aluminium atom): 1 * 27 = 27\n-   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
