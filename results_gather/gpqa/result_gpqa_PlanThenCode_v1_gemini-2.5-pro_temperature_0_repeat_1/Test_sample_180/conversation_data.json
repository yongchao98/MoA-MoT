    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  Identify the relevant solar neutrino sources and their energy spectra after the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch. The pp-III branch is the source of Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos.\n2.  Determine which of the remaining neutrino sources contribute to the two specified energy bands: Band 1 (700-800 keV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV).\n3.  Recognize the key difference between the bands: Band 2 contains the very strong, monoenergetic 861 keV neutrino line from Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) decay, which is part of the pp-II branch and is unaffected by the change.\n4.  Assign approximate flux values to the contributing sources. The crucial part is the relative magnitude: the flux of the ⁷Be line is much larger than the flux from the continuous CNO spectrum integrated over a 100 keV window.\n5.  Calculate the flux for each band by summing the contributions of the relevant sources.\n6.

    "The code successfully calculated the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes in the two specified energy bands under the hypothetical condition that the pp-III branch has stopped.\n\nThe key insight is that the pp-III branch produces high-energy Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos, which are now absent. The remaining significant sources in the energy range of interest are the CNO cycle (continuous spectrum) and the pp-II branch, which produces a very strong, monoenergetic neutrino line at 861 keV from Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) decay.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** This band only receives a small contribution from the continuous CNO spectrum. The code estimated this flux to be approximately 4.0 x 10⁷ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band receives a similar small contribution from the CNO spectrum, but it is completely dominated by the massive flux from the ⁷Be line at 861 keV, which is approximately 4.8 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s. The total flux is therefore about 4.84 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\nThe ratio is therefore approximately (4.0 x 10⁷) / (4.84 x 10⁹), which is about 0.0083. This value is very close to 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
