    "*   PLAN\n1.  Define the physical constants: the rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) and the rest energy of particle A ($m_A c^2$).\n2.  Calculate the total initial energy of the system. Since the proton and antiproton are at rest (or moving very slowly), this is the sum of their rest energies: $E_{initial} = 2 \\cdot m_p c^2$.\n3.  Apply the principle of conservation of energy. The initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$. The final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\cdot E_A = 4 \\cdot \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n4.  Solve the energy conservation equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n5.  Use the calculated value of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity $v$ in terms of the speed of light, $c$. The relationship is $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n6.

    "The code successfully calculated the velocity of particle A based on the principle of energy conservation.\n\n1.  **Initial Energy:** The total initial energy of the system was determined by the rest energy of the proton and antiproton, which is $2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n2.  **Energy Conservation:** This initial energy is completely converted into the total energy of the four resulting 'A' particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). The energy of each 'A' particle is therefore $E_A = E_{initial} / 4 = 1876.54 / 4 = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n3.  **Lorentz Factor:** The total energy of a particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$. The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, was calculated as $\\gamma = E_A / (m_A c^2) = 469.135 \\text{ MeV} / 300 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1.5638$.\n4.  **Velocity Calculation:** Using the formula $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$, the velocity was found to be approximately 0.7688c.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This value rounds to 0.77c, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
