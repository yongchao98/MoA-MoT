    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the given values for the masses (`m1`, `m2`) and velocities (`v1`, `v2`) of the two astronauts. We will treat `m` and `c` as symbolic units.\n2.  Calculate the relative speed (`v_rel`) using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula: `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`.\n3.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (`gamma`) for each astronaut using the formula: `gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`.\n4.  Calculate the total relativistic energy (`E`) for each astronaut using the formula: `E = gamma * m_rest * c^2`.\n5.  Sum the individual energies to find the total energy of the system.\n6.  Print the calculated relative speed and total energy, then compare them to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the relativistic properties of the two-astronaut system.\n\nThe relative speed was determined using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)`, which yielded a result of approximately 0.14c.\n\nThe total energy of the system was found by summing the individual relativistic energies of each astronaut, calculated with the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. The calculation resulted in a total energy of approximately 5.96 mc².\n\nComparing these results to the given options, the calculated values `v_rel = 0.14c` and `E = 5.96 mc^2` match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
