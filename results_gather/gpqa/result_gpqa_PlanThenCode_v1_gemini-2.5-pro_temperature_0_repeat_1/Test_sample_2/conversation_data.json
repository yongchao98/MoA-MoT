    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Import the `numpy` library for efficient numerical calculations and linear algebra.\n2.  Represent the quantum state `|ψ⟩` as a column vector (numpy array). The components are the coefficients of `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩`.\n3.  Define the Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` as 2x2 numpy arrays in the standard `σ_z` basis.\n4.  Construct the matrix for the full operator `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x` using matrix addition and scalar multiplication.\n5.  Calculate the expectation value using the formula `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. This involves getting the conjugate transpose of the state vector (`⟨ψ|`) and performing matrix-vector multiplications.\n6.  Print the final calculated value, rounded to one decimal place, to match the format of the options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# PLAN\n# 1.

    "The Python code successfully calculated the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x` for the quantum state `0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩`. The state vector and the Pauli matrices were defined, and the expectation value was computed using the formula `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. The final result from the calculation is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
