    "Based on the spectral data, the starting material, Compound X, was identified. The IR spectrum showed characteristic peaks for a carboxylic acid (broad O-H at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹). The ¹H NMR spectrum confirmed the carboxylic acid (10.5 ppm) and indicated a para-disubstituted benzene ring (doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm). The remaining signals were pieced together to identify a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. Thus, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\nThe reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, a powerful reducing agent combination that completely reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). Therefore, the reaction converts 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
