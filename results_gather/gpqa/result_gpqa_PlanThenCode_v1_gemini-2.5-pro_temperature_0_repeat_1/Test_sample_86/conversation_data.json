    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Analyze the problem statement to determine the key structural features of the molecule: a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, 8 total carbon atoms, a carbonyl group (C=O), and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n2.  Deduce the molecular structure from the given information. The aromatic ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents. The presence of an Ar-X bond means one substituent is a halogen. The other substituent must contain the 2 carbons and the carbonyl group, which points to an acetyl group (-COCH3). The molecule is therefore a haloacetophenone.\n3.  Consider the substitution pattern. A para (1,4) substitution pattern is the most symmetrical, leading to a simple and distinct 1H NMR spectrum with two doublets in the aromatic region.\n4.  Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone. Expect two signals (doublets) for the 4 aromatic protons between 7-8 ppm and one signal (singlet) for the 3 methyl protons around 2-2.5 ppm.\n5.  Systematically evaluate each of the provided NMR data options (A, B, C, D) by comparing them to the predicted spectrum.\n6.  Identify the option that matches the prediction and print the step-by-step reasoning and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_nmr_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes chemical information to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstructing the problem statement.\")\n    print(\" - Compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\")\n    print(\" - Total of 8 carbon atoms.\")\n    print(\" - FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O).\")\n    print(\" - FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Deducing the molecular structure.\")\n    print(\" - The aromatic ring (C6) and the halogen substituent (-X) are established.\")\n    print(\" - The remaining part of the molecule must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\")\n    print(\" - The only common substituent that fits this is an acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3.\")\n    print(\" - Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone: X-C6H4-C(=O)CH3.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Predicting the 1H NMR spectrum.\")\n    print(\" - For a para-substituted haloacetophenone (the most symmetrical isomer), we expect a specific pattern.\")\n    print(\" - Aromatic Region (4H): The 4 protons on the ring are split into two groups.

    "The Python script successfully identified the correct 1H NMR data by first deducing the molecular structure from the given information. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 total carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. This leads to the structure of a haloacetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n\nThe script then predicted the 1H NMR spectrum for the most symmetrical isomer, para-haloacetophenone. This prediction included two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) for the 4 ring protons and a singlet around 2-2.5 ppm for the 3 methyl protons.\n\nFinally, the script evaluated the four options and found that only option C, with signals at 7.8 ppm (2H, d), 7.6 ppm (2H, d), and 2.3 ppm (3H, s), perfectly matched the predicted spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
