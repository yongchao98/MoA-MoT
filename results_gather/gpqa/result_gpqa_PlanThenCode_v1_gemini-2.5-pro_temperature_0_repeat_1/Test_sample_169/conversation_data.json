Represent the spin state vector `psi` and the Pauli-Y matrix `sigma_y` using NumPy.\n2.  Calculate the normalization factor by computing the inner product `<psi|psi>`.\n3.  Calculate the numerator for the expectation value, `<psi|S_y|psi>`, where `S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y`.\n4.  Compute the final expectation value `<S_y>` by dividing the numerator from step 3 by the normalization factor from step 2.\n5.  Express the final result as a fraction of `hbar` to compare with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# The spin operator S_y is related to the Pauli matrix sigma_y by S_y = (hbar/2) * sigma_y.\n# The expectation value <S_y> for a state |psi> is given by <psi|S_y|psi> / <psi|psi>.\n\n# 1. Define the spin state vector (ket) and the S_y operator (without hbar)\npsi = np.array([[3j], [4]])\n# We calculate the expectation value of sigma_y and multiply by hbar/2 at the end.\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])\n\n# 2.

    "The Python code successfully calculated the expectation value of the spin operator in the y-direction, `S_y`, for the given spin state `|ψ> = (3i, 4)`.\n\nThe calculation proceeded as follows:\n1.  The normalization factor `<ψ|ψ>` was computed as `(-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25`.\n2.  The numerator term `<ψ|S_y|ψ>` was calculated. This involves the matrix multiplication `(hbar/2) * <ψ|σ_y|ψ>`. The code calculated `<ψ|σ_y|ψ>` to be -24.\n3.  The final expectation value `<S_y>` is the ratio of these two results: `(<ψ|S_y|ψ>) / <ψ|ψ> = (hbar/2) * (-24) / 25 = -12*hbar/25`.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
