    "PLAN:\n1.  Define the physical constants for the problem: the speed of the spacecraft as a fraction of the speed of light (`v/c`), and the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud in light-years. A standard value of 159,000 light-years will be used as it aligns with the provided options.\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (`gamma`), which quantifies the magnitude of time dilation, using the formula `gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)`.\n3.  Calculate the travel time as measured by a stationary observer on Earth (`time_earth`). This is found by dividing the distance by the spacecraft's speed.\n4.  Apply the principle of time dilation to find the time elapsed for the astronaut (`time_astronaut`). This proper time is calculated with the formula `time_astronaut = time_earth / gamma`.\n5.  Check if the astronaut survives the journey by comparing the calculated travel time to their remaining lifespan (150 years - 22 years).\n6.  Print the final calculated travel time for the astronaut and identify the closest answer from the multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the effects of special relativity on a high-speed space journey. Using the principles of time dilation, the code determined the time experienced by an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud (assumed to be 159,000 light-years away) at 99.999987% of the speed of light.\n\nThe calculation shows that while over 159,000 years would pass on Earth, the time elapsed for the astronaut would be only about 81.07 years. Since the 22-year-old astronaut has a remaining lifespan of 128 years, they would survive the journey. The calculated travel time of approximately 81 years directly corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
