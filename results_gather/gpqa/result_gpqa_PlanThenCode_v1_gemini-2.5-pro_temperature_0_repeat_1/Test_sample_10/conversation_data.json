    "Here is my plan to identify the incorrect statement about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1.  Define a function to analyze the four provided statements (A, B, C, D).\n2.  Store each statement and a brief scientific evaluation in a data structure, like a dictionary.\n3.  Evaluate statement A: Analyze the mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in coronaviruses. This is a known, correct mechanism.\n4.  Evaluate statement B: Analyze the relationship between pseudoknot conformation and frameshifting rates. This is a complex but studied phenomenon, and the statement is largely consistent with findings.\n5.  Evaluate statement C: Analyze the role of ORF3a in apoptosis. The description of activating the extrinsic pathway via caspase-8 is supported by research.\n6.  Evaluate statement D: Analyze the function of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. The primary role is proofreading (mismatch repair), not preventing dsRNA breakdown, making this statement functionally inaccurate. The function will print the analysis and identify D as the incorrect statement.\n\n```python\ndef find_incorrect_statement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four statements about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology\n    and identifies the incorrect one.\n    \"\"\"\n    statements = {\n        'A': \"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot.
