    "PLAN:\n1.  Define the given ratios for the equilibrium temperatures: T1/T2 and T2/T3.\n2.  Calculate the overall temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3 (T1/T3) by multiplying the two given ratios.\n3.  Establish the physical relationship between a planet's orbital period (P) and its equilibrium temperature (T). The period P is proportional to the orbital radius `a` to the power of 3/2 (P ∝ a^(3/2)), and the temperature T is proportional to `a` to the power of -1/2 (T ∝ a^(-1/2)). This leads to the relationship P ∝ T^(-3).\n4.  Use the relationship from the previous step to express the period ratio P3/P1 in terms of the temperature ratio T1/T3. The formula will be P3/P1 = (T1/T3)^3.\n5.  Calculate the numerical value for the period ratio P3/P1.\n6.  Print the final calculated factor and compare it to the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1. Define the given ratios.\n# Note: Mass ratios and albedo are not needed for this calculation as they cancel out\n# or are irrelevant to the core relationship between period and temperature.\ntemp_ratio_1_to_2 = 1.4  # T1 / T2\ntemp_ratio_2_to_3 = 2.3  # T2 / T3\n\n# 2. Calculate the overall temperature ratio T1/T3.\n# (T1 / T3) = (T1 / T2) * (T2 / T3)\ntemp_ratio_1_to_3 = temp_ratio_1_to_2 * temp_ratio_2_to_3\n\n# 3. & 4. The relationship between orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T) is P ∝ T⁻³.\n# Therefore, the ratio of the periods P3/P1 can be calculated as (T1/T3)³.\n# Let's derive this for clarity:\n# Equilibrium Temperature T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a), where 'a' is the orbital radius.\n# This means a ∝ 1 / T_eq².\n# Kepler's Third Law states P² ∝ a³, so P ∝ a^(3/2).\n# Substituting 'a': P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2) => P ∝ 1 / T_eq³ or P ∝ T_eq⁻³.\n# So, P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)³.\n\n# 5. Calculate the period ratio P3/P1.\nperiod_ratio_3_to_1 = temp_ratio_1_to_3 ** 3\n\n# 6. Print the final result and compare with options.\nprint(f\"The calculated temperature ratio T1/T3 is: {temp_ratio_1_to_3:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 (P3/P1) is: {period_ratio_3_to_1:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 4.4\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 3.2\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 33.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 10.4\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {period_ratio_3_to_1:.2f} is closest to option C.\")\n\n```",
    "The code successfully calculated the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\nFirst, it determined the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet3 (T1/T3) by multiplying the given ratios: (T1/T2) * (T2/T3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22.\n\nNext, it used the physical relationship between a planet's orbital period (P) and its equilibrium temperature (T), which is P ∝ T⁻³. This means the ratio of the periods P3/P1 is equal to the cube of the inverse temperature ratio (T1/T3)³.\n\nFinally, it calculated the period ratio by cubing the temperature ratio: (3.22)³ ≈ 33.39. This value is closest to the multiple-choice option C. The mass and albedo information was correctly identified as irrelevant to this specific calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
