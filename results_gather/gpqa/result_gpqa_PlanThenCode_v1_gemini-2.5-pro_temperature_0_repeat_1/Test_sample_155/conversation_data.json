    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Determine the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1. The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a (E) or *trans*-alkene, which results in a meso compound.\n2.  Determine the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2. The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a (Z) or *cis*-alkene, which results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n3.  Combine the products from both reactions to form the final mixture. This mixture will contain three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and the pair of enantiomers.\n4.  Analyze the mixture using standard (achiral) HPLC. This technique separates diastereomers but not enantiomers. Count the number of expected peaks.\n5.  Analyze the mixture using chiral HPLC. This technique separates all stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers. Count the number of expected peaks.\n6.  Compare the calculated peak counts to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of HPLC peaks for a mixture of reaction products.\n    \"\"\"\n    # PLAN\n    # 1.

    "The Python code correctly analyzed the stereochemical outcomes of the two reactions and predicted the results of the chromatographic separations.\n\n*   **Reaction 1** ((E)-oct-4-ene) produces one meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2** ((Z)-oct-4-ene) produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   The **final mixture** contains these three stereoisomers.\n*   On a **standard (achiral) HPLC**, diastereomers are separated, but enantiomers are not. The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the two enantiomers elute together as one peak, and the meso compound elutes as a second peak, resulting in a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   On a **chiral HPLC**, all stereoisomers are separated. The meso compound, the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and the (4S,5S) enantiomer will all have distinct retention times, resulting in a total of **3 peaks**.\n\nThe analysis concludes that the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
