    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Calculate the initial number of moles for each reactant: the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2). Remember that Ba(OH)2 provides two moles of OH- for every mole of the compound.\n2.  Simulate the neutralization reaction between the strong acid (H+) and the strong base (OH-). Determine which one is in excess and calculate the remaining moles.\n3.  React the remaining strong species (in this case, OH-) with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Calculate the final moles of the weak acid, its conjugate base, and any remaining strong base.\n4.  Determine the final composition of the solution. Since there will be an excess of strong base (OH-), the pH will be dictated by its concentration.\n5.  Calculate the total volume of the final solution by summing the initial volumes.\n6.  Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH-, then determine the pOH, and finally, calculate the pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solution_ph():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pH of a mixed solution of a weak acid, strong acid, and strong base.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

    "The code successfully calculated the pH of the mixed solution by following these steps:\n1.  It determined the initial moles of the weak acid (0.0500 mol CH3COOH), strong acid (0.0800 mol H+), and strong base (0.1800 mol OH-).\n2.  It simulated the neutralization of the strong acid and strong base, resulting in 0.1000 moles of OH- remaining.\n3.  This remaining strong base then neutralized all 0.0500 moles of the weak acid, leaving a final excess of 0.0500 moles of OH-.\n4.  The final concentration of OH- was calculated in the total volume of 1.2 L, yielding [OH-] ≈ 0.0417 M.\n5.  From this concentration, the pOH was calculated as 1.38, and the final pH was determined to be 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
