    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Define the given decay probability in 100 minutes (32%) and the time intervals.\n2.  Calculate the corresponding survival probability for 100 minutes by subtracting the decay probability from 1.\n3.  Recognize that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes it has already survived and is equivalent to the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n4.  Use the 100-minute survival probability (`S_100`) to find the 150-minute survival probability (`S_150`). The relationship is `S_150 = S_100 ^ (150 / 100)`.\n5.  Calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes as `1 - S_150`.\n6.  Print the final result as a percentage and compare it to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_decay_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of an atom decaying in a given timeframe,\n    based on a known decay probability over a different timeframe.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given: Probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%\n    p_decay_100 = 0.32\n    t1 = 100  # minutes\n    \n    # The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes,\n    # given it has survived 50 minutes.\n    t2 = 150 # minutes\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the survival probability for 100 minutes.\n    # P(survival) = 1 - P(decay)\n    p_survival_100 = 1 - p_decay_100\n    \n    # Step 2: Apply the memoryless property of radioactive decay.\n    # The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the past.\n    # It's the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    # The survival probability S(t) follows S(t) = S(t_ref)^(t/t_ref).\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes.\n    p_survival_150 = p_survival_100 ** (t2 / t1)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes.\n    p_decay_150 = 1 - p_survival_150\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the final result and compare with options.\n    print(f\"The probability of survival for 100 minutes is: {p_survival_100:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The probability of survival for 150 minutes is: {p_survival_150:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {p_decay_150:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"As a percentage, this is: {p_decay_150:.2%}\")\n    \n    options = {\"A\": 0.40, \"B\": 0.52, \"C\": 0.44, \"D\": 0.48}\n    # Find the option with the minimum absolute difference from the calculated probability\n    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - p_decay_150))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated probability {p_decay_150:.2%} is closest to option {closest_option}) {options[closest_option]:.0%}.\")\n\nsolve_decay_probability()\n```",
    "The Python code executed the plan to solve the radioactive decay problem.\n\n1.  It first established the survival probability over 100 minutes as `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n2.  Recognizing that radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability.\n3.  The code then calculated the survival probability for the next 150 minutes using the formula `S(150) = S(100)^(150/100)`, which resulted in `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n4.  The decay probability for this 150-minute period is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`, or 43.93%.\n5.  This calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to option C, which is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
