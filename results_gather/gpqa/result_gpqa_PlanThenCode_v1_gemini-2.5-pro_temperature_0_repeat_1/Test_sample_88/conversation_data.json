    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Analyze the three-step reaction sequence starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n2.  Deduce the structure of the intermediate, Product 1. Despite inconsistencies in the provided spectral data, the reaction conditions and subsequent ozonolysis strongly suggest the formation of an alkenone via rearrangement. The most plausible structure is protoadamant-4-en-2-one.\n3.  Determine the structure of Product 2, which is formed by the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of the ketone in Product 1 to an alcohol, yielding protoadamant-4-en-2-ol.\n4.  Determine the structure of Product 3, the product of ozonolysis of Product 2. This reaction cleaves the double bond to form a bicyclic dialdehyde-alcohol.\n5.  Identify the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in Product 3, which are the aldehyde protons.\n6.  Analyze the spin-spin coupling pattern for the aldehyde protons in the rigid bicyclic structure of Product 3, considering both vicinal (³J) and long-range (⁴J) coupling, to determine the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the multi-step organic chemistry synthesis problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and deduce product structures.\n    # Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH -> Product 1 (Alkenone)\n    # The harsh conditions (240C, KOH) suggest a complex rearrangement.

    "The reaction sequence begins with the rearrangement of 1,3-dibromoadamantane under harsh basic conditions to form an alkenone, protoadamant-4-en-2-one (Product 1). This is supported by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ketone) and the subsequent ozonolysis reaction, which requires a double bond.\n\nProduct 1 is then reduced via a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction to the corresponding alcohol, protoadamant-4-en-2-ol (Product 2).\n\nFinally, ozonolysis of Product 2 with a reductive workup (dimethylsulfide) cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond, opening a ring to form a bicyclic dialdehyde-alcohol (Product 3). The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in this molecule are the two aldehyde protons.\n\nDue to the asymmetry of the molecule, the two aldehyde protons are in different chemical environments. One aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group, leading to vicinal coupling that splits its signal into a triplet. In the rigid bicyclo[3.2.1]octane framework of Product 3, this aldehyde proton also experiences significant long-range (4-bond) \"W-coupling\" to another CH₂ group, which further splits the signal into another triplet. The resulting pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
