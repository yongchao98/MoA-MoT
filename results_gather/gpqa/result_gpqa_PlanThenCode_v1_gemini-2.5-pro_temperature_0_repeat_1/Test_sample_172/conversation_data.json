    "The code successfully calculated the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nFirst, the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) was determined using the formula Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant and Δx is the uncertainty in position (0.1 nm or 1e-10 m). This yielded Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s.\n\nNext, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) was estimated using the relationship ΔE ≈ v * Δp, where v is the electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s). The calculation resulted in a minimum energy uncertainty of ΔE ≈ 1.05 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the value 1.05 x 10⁻¹⁶ J is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
