    "PLAN:\n1.  Establish the formula for the fraction of surviving particles, `f`, which follows an exponential decay law modified by relativistic time dilation: `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`, where `t` is the lab-frame time of flight, `γ` is the Lorentz factor, and `τ` is the proper mean lifetime.\n2.  Recognize that the time of flight `t` is the detector radius `R` divided by the particle speed (approximated as `c`), making `t` a constant. The term `R / (c * τ)` can be treated as a single constant, let's call it `K'`. The formula simplifies to `f = exp(-K' / γ)`.\n3.  Use the initial condition (γ₁ = 20, f₁ = 1/3) to solve for the constant `K'`. The equation is `ln(f₁) = -K' / γ₁`.\n4.  Set up the equation for the target condition (f₂ = 2/3) with the unknown Lorentz factor `γ₂`: `ln(f₂) = -K' / γ₂`.\n5.  Solve the two equations for `γ₂` by eliminating `K'`. This yields the relationship `γ₂ = γ₁ * ln(f₁) / ln(f₂)`.\n6.  Calculate the numerical value of `γ₂` using the given values and identify the closest multiple-choice option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_lorentz_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the required Lorentz factor for a given particle survival rate.\n    \"\"\"\n    # PLAN\n    # 1.
