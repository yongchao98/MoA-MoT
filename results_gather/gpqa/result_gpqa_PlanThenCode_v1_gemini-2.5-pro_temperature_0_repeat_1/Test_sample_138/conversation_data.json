    "**PLAN**\n1.  Identify the chemical transformation performed by the reagents `NaNO2, HCl, H2O`. This reagent system is used for the nitrosation of an alpha-carbon of a ketone, which upon hydrolysis yields an alpha-diketone. The overall reaction converts a `-CH2-` group adjacent to a carbonyl into a new carbonyl group (`-C=O`).\n2.  Analyze the first reaction product: 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. Determine the structure of the starting material (A) that would yield this product via the identified transformation. This requires a ketone with a carbonyl at position 1 (or 2) and a methylene group at the adjacent position.\n3.  Analyze the second reaction product: 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. Determine the structure of the starting material (B) that would yield this product. This requires a ketone with a carbonyl at position 2 (or 3) and an adjacent methylene group.\n4.  Evaluate the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the pair of starting materials (A and B) that match the structures determined in the previous steps.\n5.
