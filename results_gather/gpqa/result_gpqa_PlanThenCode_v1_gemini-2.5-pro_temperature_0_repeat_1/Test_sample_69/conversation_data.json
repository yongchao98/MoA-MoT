    "*   **PLAN**\n    1.  Analyze the provided chemical clues to identify the unknown substances A through H.\n    2.  Use the hydrolysis reaction (Clue 3) and the formation of the solvent H (Clue 4) as the most definitive starting points to form a hypothesis.\n    3.  Based on the reactions, deduce the identities: A=Iodine(I₂), B=Chlorine(Cl₂), C=Iodine monochloride(ICl), D=Carbon monoxide(CO), H=Phosgene(COCl₂), F=Hydrochloric acid(HCl), and G=Iodic acid(HIO₃).\n    4.  Identify the extremely hazardous product E, which is formed from the reaction of C (ICl) with 2 equivalents of D (CO). This product is the dicarbonyliodine(I) cation, [I(CO)₂]⁺.\n    5.  Determine the molecular geometry of the [I(CO)₂]⁺ cation using VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory.\n    6.

    "Based on the chemical clues provided, the compounds were identified as follows: A is Iodine (I₂), B is Chlorine (Cl₂), C is Iodine monochloride (ICl), D is Carbon monoxide (CO), H is Phosgene (COCl₂), F is Hydrochloric acid (HCl), and G is Iodic acid (HIO₃).\n\nThe extremely hazardous product E is formed from the reaction of C (ICl) with two equivalents of D (CO), resulting in the dicarbonyliodine(I) cation, [I(CO)₂]⁺.\n\nUsing VSEPR theory to determine the geometry of this cation, the central Iodine(I) ion has 6 valence electrons. It forms two bonds with the carbon monoxide ligands and has two lone pairs of electrons. This AX₂E₂ configuration results in a bent molecular geometry, similar to water. A bent molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes, which corresponds to the C₂ᵥ point group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
