    "This is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze FTIR Data:** Interpret the given FTIR absorption peaks (broad at 3000 cm⁻¹ and strong at 1700 cm⁻¹) to identify the primary functional group present in the molecule.\n2.  **Analyze 1H NMR Splitting:** Deconstruct the complex splitting patterns. A \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) means a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighbors: one proton (d), two protons (t), and three protons (q), for a total of 1+2+3=6 neighbors. A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) means a proton is coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and another two protons (t), for a total of 1+2+2=5 neighbors.\n3.  **Evaluate Candidate A:** Draw the structure for CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH and determine the number of neighbors for its methine (-CH-) protons to see if they match the required splitting.\n4.  **Evaluate Candidate B:** Draw the structure for CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH and determine the number of neighbors for its methine (-CH-) protons.\n5.  **Evaluate Candidate C:** Draw the structure for CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH and determine the number of neighbors for its methine (-CH-) protons.\n6.  **Evaluate Candidate D:** Draw the structure for CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH and determine the number of neighbors for its methine (-CH-) protons, then conclude which candidate matches the spectral data.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the correct chemical structure based on provided FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data\")\n    print(\" - A very broad absorption at 3000 cm-1 is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (due to hydrogen bonding).\")\n    print(\" - A strong absorption at 1700 cm-1 is characteristic of a C=O stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\" - Conclusion: The compound is a carboxylic acid.

    "The Python script successfully identified the unknown compound by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\nFirst, the FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹) confirmed the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which was consistent with all four possible options.\n\nThe decisive information came from the 1H NMR spectrum. The script correctly interpreted the complex splitting patterns:\n*   A \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) requires a proton to be coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons: one proton, two protons, and three protons, for a total of 6 neighbors.\n*   A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) requires a proton to be coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons: one proton, two protons, and another two protons, for a total of 5 neighbors.\n\nBy examining the structure of each candidate molecule, the script determined the number of neighbors for the key methine (-CH-) protons. Only candidate C, CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH, possessed two methine protons that matched the required neighbor counts (one with 5 neighbors and one with 6 neighbors), thus producing the observed dtt and dtq signals. The other candidates failed to match both splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>"
