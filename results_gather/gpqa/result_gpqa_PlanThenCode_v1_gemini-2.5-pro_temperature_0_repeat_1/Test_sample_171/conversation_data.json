    "The Python code successfully derived the relationship between the temperatures of the two stars. It began with the Boltzmann equation and applied the condition that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. Through algebraic manipulation, including taking the natural logarithm, the code derived the expression `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )`. By substituting the given energy difference (ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) and the known Boltzmann constant (k = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K), the factor (ΔE / k) simplified to 1. This resulted in the final equation `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
