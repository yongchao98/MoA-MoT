    "PLAN:\n1.  Define constants for the problem: ESPRESSO's limiting apparent magnitude (V_limit) for the specified S/N and exposure time, and the approximate northern declination limit for the VLT at Paranal Observatory.\n2.  Create a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a star and contains its properties like name, apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, distance, and declination.\n3.  Define a function to calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance in parsecs, using the distance modulus formula: m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(distance) - 5.\n4.  Iterate through the list of stars. For each star, determine its apparent magnitude, either by using the pre-defined value or by calculating it if necessary.\n5.  For each star, check two conditions for detectability:\n    a. Is its apparent magnitude brighter than or equal to the V_limit?\n    b. Is its declination within the observable range from Paranal?\n6.  Count the number of stars that meet both conditions and print the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, distance_pc):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent magnitude from absolute magnitude and distance.\"\"\"\n    # Distance modulus formula: m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    if distance_pc <= 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    return M_V + 5 * math.log10(distance_pc) - 5\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines how many of the listed stars are detectable by ESPRESSO at the VLT.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants ---\n    # From ESPRESSO documentation for 1-UT mode, 1-hour exposure, S/N=10,\n    # the limiting magnitude is approximately V=16.5.\n    V_LIMIT = 16.5\n    \n    # Paranal Observatory is at latitude ~-24.6 deg.

    "The Python script successfully determined the number of stars detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT based on two criteria: apparent magnitude and declination.\n\nThe script established a limiting apparent magnitude of V=16.5 for a 1-hour exposure with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. It also set a declination limit of +30 degrees, as the VLT is in the Southern Hemisphere and cannot observe far-northern stars like Polaris.\n\nThe analysis of each star yielded the following results:\n*   **Canopus:** Detectable (very bright and visible from Paranal).\n*   **Polaris:** Not detectable (declination is too far north).\n*   **Star at 10 pc:** Detectable (apparent magnitude of 15.0 is within the limit).\n*   **Star at 200 pc:** Not detectable (apparent magnitude of 21.5 is too faint).\n*   **Star at 5 pc:** Detectable (apparent magnitude of 13.5 is within the limit).\n*   **Star at 50 pc:** Not detectable (apparent magnitude of 18.5 is too faint).\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars were found to be detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
