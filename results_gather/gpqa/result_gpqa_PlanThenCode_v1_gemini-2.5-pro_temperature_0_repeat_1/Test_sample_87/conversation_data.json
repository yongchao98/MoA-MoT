    "PLAN:\n1.  Define the key observations from the biological scenario (location, cell state, and genetic change) as variables within a Python script.\n2.  Create a data structure, such as a dictionary, to store the defining characteristics of each immunological process listed in the multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).\n3.  Implement a function that systematically iterates through each option.\n4.  Inside the function, compare the scenario's observations with the characteristics of each process to check for matches or mismatches.\n5.  The function will identify the single process where all characteristics align with the observations.\n6.

    "The Python script successfully analyzed the biological scenario by breaking it down into key observations: location (secondary lymphoid organ), context (proliferating cells after antigen encounter), and genetic change (high variability in the variable heavy chain gene). It then systematically compared these observations against the defining characteristics of the four provided options.\n\nThe script's logic correctly eliminated options A, B, and C due to mismatches in location, timing relative to antigen encounter, or the specific type of genetic change. It found that only Somatic Hypermutation (Option D) perfectly matched all three key observations from the scenario.\n\n<<<D>>>"
