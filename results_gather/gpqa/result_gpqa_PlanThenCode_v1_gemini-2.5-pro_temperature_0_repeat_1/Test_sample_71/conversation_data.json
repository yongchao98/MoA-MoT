    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Identify the reactants and reagents. 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a dienophile. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with sodium iodide to generate the highly reactive diene, o-xylylene (5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene). The norbornadiene undergoes two successive Diels-Alder reactions with two molecules of o-xylylene to form product 1.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This is a standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether, converting the -OtBu group into a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming product 2.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with SO3/pyridine in DMSO. This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, which oxidizes the secondary alcohol at the bridge position to a ketone (C=O), forming product 3.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** Product 3 is heated. The structure of product 3 is a double Diels-Alder adduct. Heating induces a retro-Diels-Alder cascade. The molecule fragments into its original components, but with the dienophile part modified.\n5.  **Identify Final Product:** The fragmentation yields two molecules of o-xylylene and one molecule of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. The latter is unstable and readily extrudes carbon monoxide (CO) to form benzene. The question asks for \"product 4\", which is interpreted as the main organic fragment generated, o-xylylene.\n6.  **Count Distinct Hydrogens:** Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the final product, o-xylylene. This involves analyzing its molecular symmetry. The molecule adopts a non-planar, C2-symmetric conformation, which dictates the equivalence of its hydrogen atoms.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the multi-step synthesis problem by deducing the structure of the final product\n    and counting its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Formation of o-xylylene and Diels-Alder reaction\n    # 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene + NaI -> o-xylylene (5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene)\n    # 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene + 2x o-xylylene -> Product 1 (a double Diels-Alder adduct)\n    # This reaction is a known method to generate and trap o-xylylene.\n\n    # Step 2: Hydrolysis of the ether\n    # Product 1 (-OtBu) + H2SO4/H2O -> Product 2 (-OH)\n    # The acid-labile tert-butyl ether is cleaved to form a secondary alcohol.\n\n    # Step 3: Oxidation of the alcohol\n    # Product 2 (-OH) + SO3/pyridine/DMSO -> Product 3 (=O)\n    # The Parikh-Doering oxidation converts the secondary alcohol to a ketone.\n\n    # Step 4: Thermal fragmentation (Retro-Diels-Alder)\n    # Product 3 (ketone adduct) + heat -> Fragments\n    # Heating a Diels-Alder adduct can reverse the reaction.

    "The code successfully executed the multi-step chemical synthesis problem.\n1.  It correctly identified that the reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide generates the reactive diene, *o*-xylylene.\n2.  It deduced that this diene undergoes a double Diels-Alder reaction with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, to form product 1.\n3.  The subsequent steps were correctly identified as acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ether (forming alcohol 2), Parikh-Doering oxidation to a ketone (product 3), and finally a thermal retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n4.  The retro-Diels-Alder reaction regenerates the diene, *o*-xylylene, which is identified as the final product 4.\n5.  By analyzing the C2 symmetry of the non-planar *o*-xylylene molecule, the code correctly determined that there are four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe final count of 4 distinct hydrogen atoms corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
