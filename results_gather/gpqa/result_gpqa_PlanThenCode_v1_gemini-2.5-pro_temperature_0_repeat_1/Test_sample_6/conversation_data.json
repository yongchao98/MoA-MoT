    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the necessary physical constants: the rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) in electron-volts (eV) and the average energy of a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($E_{CMB}$) in eV.\n2.  State the kinematic threshold formula for pair production ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$) from a head-on collision. The threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$) is given by $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$.\n3.  Calculate the threshold energy $E_{\\gamma}$ in units of eV using the defined constants.\n4.  Convert the calculated energy from eV to giga-electron-volts (GeV), as the options are provided in this unit ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$).\n5.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray to annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon, creating an electron-positron pair.\n\nUsing the standard values for the electron rest mass energy ($m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511$ MeV) and the average CMB photon energy ($E_{CMB} \\approx 10^{-3}$ eV), the kinematic threshold energy for the gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$) was calculated using the formula $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$.\n\nThe calculation yielded a threshold energy of approximately $2.61 \\times 10^{14}$ eV, which is equivalent to $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV. This result matches option B. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies around and above this value will have their lifetimes significantly limited by this pair-production process.\n\n<<<B>>>"
