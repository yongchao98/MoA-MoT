    "Here is a plan to solve the titration problem:\n1.  Define all the initial constants provided in the problem: initial acid volume and concentration, added water volume, base concentration, and the acid dissociation constant (Ka).\n2.  Calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after it has been diluted with water. The moles of acid remain the same, but the total volume increases.\n3.  Calculate the pH at 25% titration. This is a buffer region, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])) can be used. At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A-] to acid [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n4.  Calculate the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point, where moles of acid equal moles of base.\n5.  Calculate the pH at the equivalence point. At this point, all the acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this conjugate base. We will calculate its concentration, find Kb from Ka, and then determine the hydroxide concentration [OH-] to find the pOH and finally the pH.\n6.  Print the calculated pH values for both points, formatted to two decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN\n# 1.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the pH at two key points during the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH.\n\nFirst, it determined the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution, which is 0.025 M.\n\nFor the 25% titration point, it used the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa of acetic acid (Ka = 1.85x10⁻⁵) is approximately 4.73. At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base to acid ([A⁻]/[HA]) is 25/75, or 1/3. The pH was calculated as pKa + log(1/3), resulting in a pH of 4.26.\n\nFor the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to its conjugate base, acetate. The script calculated the concentration of the acetate ion at this point, determined the Kb for acetate (Kw/Ka), and then found the hydroxide concentration from the hydrolysis of acetate. This led to a pOH, which was then converted to a pH of 8.52.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. These results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
