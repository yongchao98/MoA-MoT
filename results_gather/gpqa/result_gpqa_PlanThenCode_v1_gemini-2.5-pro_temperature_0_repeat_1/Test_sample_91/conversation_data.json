    "Here is a plan to calculate the enthalpy of formation:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecule:** Determine the molecular formula (CₓHᵧ) and count the number of each type of bond (C-C, C=C, C-H) in the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n2.  **Calculate Reactant Atomization Energy:** Calculate the total energy required to break the reactants (solid Carbon and H₂ gas) into gaseous atoms. This is the sum of the enthalpy of atomization for all carbon atoms and the bond energy for all H-H bonds.\n3.  **Calculate Product Bond Energy:** Calculate the total energy released when forming one mole of the product. This is the sum of all bond energies (C-C, C=C, C-H) within the molecule.\n4.  **Calculate Enthalpy of Formation (per mole):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the reactant atomization energy (energy input) and the product's total bond energy (energy output).\n5.  **Calculate Molar Mass:** Determine the molar mass of the molecule C₁₂H₂₂.\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g:** Convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g by dividing by the molar mass, and print the final result to compare with the given options.\n\n```python\n# 1.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the enthalpy of formation for the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\nThe calculation proceeded as follows:\n1.  The energy required to break the reactants (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H₂ gas) into gaseous atoms was determined to be 13100 kJ.\n2.  The total energy released upon forming all the bonds in one mole of the product (C₁₂H₂₂) was calculated as 11200 kJ.\n3.  The enthalpy of formation per mole was found by subtracting the product's bond energy from the reactant's atomization energy, resulting in 1900 kJ/mol.\n4.  This value was then converted to kJ/g by dividing by the molecule's molar mass (166 g/mol), yielding a final result of approximately 11.45 kJ/g.\n\nThis calculated value of 11.45 kJ/g corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
