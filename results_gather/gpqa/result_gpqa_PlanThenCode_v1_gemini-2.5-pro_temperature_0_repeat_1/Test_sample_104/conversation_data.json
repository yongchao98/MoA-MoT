    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the given physical parameters: the star's effective temperature (`T_eff`), the temperature difference of the spots (`delta_T`), and the spot filling factor (`f`).\n2.  Calculate the absolute temperature of the spots (`T_spot`) by subtracting the temperature difference from the star's effective temperature.\n3.  Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the rotating spotted star. This is determined by the fractional flux difference between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres, which can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`Flux ∝ T^4`) and is given by the formula: `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n4.  Equate this amplitude to the signal produced by a transiting exoplanet. The transit depth (amplitude) for an exoplanet is given by the ratio of the areas: `(R_planet / R_star)^2`.\n5.  Solve for the required planet-to-star radius ratio (`R_pl / R_star`) by taking the square root of the amplitude calculated in step 3.\n6.  Print the final calculated ratio and identify the closest matching option from the provided choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# 1.

    "The code successfully calculated the brightness variation caused by the spotted star and determined the equivalent exoplanet size needed to produce the same signal.\n\nFirst, the temperature of the spots was calculated to be 5000 K. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`Flux ∝ T^4`), the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the rotating star was found to be approximately 0.1035. This amplitude represents the fractional dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer.\n\nFor a transiting exoplanet, the dip in brightness (transit depth) is equal to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (`(R_pl / R_star)^2`). By equating the spot-induced amplitude to the transit depth, the required planet-to-star radius ratio was calculated by taking the square root of the amplitude.\n\nThe resulting ratio, `R_pl / R_star`, was found to be approximately 0.3218. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
