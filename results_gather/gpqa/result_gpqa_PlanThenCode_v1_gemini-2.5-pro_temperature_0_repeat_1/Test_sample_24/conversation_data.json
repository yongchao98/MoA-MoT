    "Based on the analysis, the first reaction is a Pinacol Rearrangement. This reaction requires a 1,2-diol as the starting material to form a ketone under acidic conditions. The reactant `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` is a 1,2-diol that correctly rearranges to the spirocyclic ketone product, identifying reactant A and eliminating options A and B.\n\nThe second reaction is a [1,2]-Wittig Rearrangement. This reaction involves the deprotonation of an ether with a strong base like BuLi, followed by rearrangement and protonation to form a homoallylic alcohol. The reactant `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene` is an ether that undergoes this specific rearrangement to yield the given alcohol product. The alternative reactant, a ketone, would produce a different product upon reaction with BuLi.\n\nThus, the correct reactants are A = `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` and B = `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
