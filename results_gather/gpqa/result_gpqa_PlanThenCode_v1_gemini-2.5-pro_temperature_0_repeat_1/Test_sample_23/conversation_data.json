    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Determine the empirical and molecular formula of the hydrocarbon Z using the given mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%).\n2.  Identify substance Z based on its properties (saturated, widely used solvent) and the derived formula.\n3.  Deduce the composition of mixture Y. Since Y is formed by disproportionation, does not decolorize bromine water, and hydrogenates to Z, it must be an equimolar mixture of Z and the corresponding aromatic compound.\n4.  Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in one equimolar unit of mixture Y (i.e., one molecule of each component).\n5.  Apply the principle of conservation of mass. The disproportionation reaction `Mixture X -> Mixture Y` means the total number of atoms is conserved. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X is equal to the total calculated for mixture Y.\n6.  Compare the final result with the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the described chemistry problem by deducing the molecular structures step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify Substance Z\n    print(\"PLAN Step 1 & 2: Identify Substance Z from its H mass fraction.\")\n    # Mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is very close to 1/7.\n    # For a hydrocarbon C_n H_m, H_fraction = m / (12n + m).\n    # If m / (12n + m) = 1/7, then 7m = 12n + m, which simplifies to 6m = 12n, or m = 2n.\n    # The general formula is C_n H_2n.\n    # Since Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    # The problem states Z is a widely used solvent.

    "Based on the logical steps executed by the code:\n\n1.  **Substance Z Identification**: The hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% (approximately 1/7) and being fully saturated (cannot be hydrogenated further) was identified as a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. Given it's a common solvent, it was correctly deduced to be Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Mixture Y Composition**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture that does not decolorize bromine water, contains Z as a component, and hydrogenates entirely to Z. This leads to the conclusion that Y is a mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Atom Conservation**: The transformation of mixture X into mixture Y is a disproportionation reaction, which means the total number of atoms of each element is conserved. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture Y.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in one equimolar unit of mixture Y is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of Cyclohexane (12 H atoms) and one molecule of Benzene (6 H atoms).\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThis total of 18 hydrogen atoms must also be present in the two molecules of the initial mixture X.\n\n<<<D>>>"
