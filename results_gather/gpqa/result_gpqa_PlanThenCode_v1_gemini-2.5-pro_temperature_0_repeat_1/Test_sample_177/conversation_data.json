    "The analysis determined the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimensions of Fields:** In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of 4. From their respective kinetic terms, the mass dimension of a fermion field `ψ` is `[ψ] = 3/2`, and the mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor `F^μν` is `[F] = 2`.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of κ:** The interaction Lagrangian is `L_int = κ * ψ_bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`. The term `σ_μν` is dimensionless. For `L_int` to have a mass dimension of 4, the dimensions of its components must satisfy `[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [ψ] + [F] = 4`. Substituting the known values gives `[κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 4`, which simplifies to `[κ] + 5 = 4`. Therefore, the mass dimension of `κ` is `[κ] = -1`.\n\n3.  **Renormalizability:** According to the power-counting criterion, a theory is non-renormalizable if it contains any interaction with a coupling constant that has a negative mass dimension. Since `[κ] = -1`, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
