    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The total probability of finding a particle in the allowed region (from x=1 to x=3) must be 1. This is the normalization condition for the wave function.\n2.  The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|^2`. For a complex function `ψ = R + iI`, the magnitude squared is `R^2 + I^2`.\n3.  In this case, `R = a / sqrt(1 + x)` and `I = -0.5`. So, the probability density is `|ψ(x)|^2 = (a^2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25`.\n4.  The normalization condition is expressed as the definite integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 being equal to 1: `∫[from 1 to 3] ((a^2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25) dx = 1`.\n5.  Solving this integral analytically yields the equation: `a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`.\n6.  Rearrange the equation to solve for `a`, which gives `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`. We will compute this value using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem of finding 'a' reduces to solving the equation derived from the normalization condition:\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n# Calculate the natural logarithm of 2\nln_2 = math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate the value of a^2\na_squared = 0.5 / ln_2\n\n# Calculate the value of a by taking the square root\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The analytical solution for 'a' is sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).\")\nprint(f\"The numerical value of 'a' is: {a}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this value to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 1.1\")\nprint(\"B) 0.35\")\nprint(\"C) 0.85\")\nprint(\"D) 0.6\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {a:.3f} is closest to 0.85.\")\n\n```",
    "The Python code successfully calculated the value of the normalization constant 'a' based on the principle that the total probability of finding the particle within the allowed region (x=1 to x=3) must be equal to 1.\n\nThe normalization condition is given by the integral of the probability density, `|ψ(x)|^2`, over the allowed range. The probability density was determined to be `(a^2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25`. Integrating this from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result to 1 yields the equation `a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`.\n\nSolving this equation for 'a' gives `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`. The code computed this value to be approximately 0.8493. Comparing this result to the provided options, it is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
