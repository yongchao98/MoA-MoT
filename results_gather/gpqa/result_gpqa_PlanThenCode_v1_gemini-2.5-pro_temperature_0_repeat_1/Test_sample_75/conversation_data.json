    "The Python code simulated the biological experiment of injecting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into a blastocyst. The key variables were the red-labeled iPSCs and the green-labeled apoptosis marker (TUNEL). The simulation correctly modeled the biological principle that a significant number of injected cells fail to integrate and are eliminated by the host embryo through apoptosis.\n\nThe output shows that out of 15 injected cells, 10 became apoptotic. In the context of the experiment, these 10 cells would appear both red (from their inherent mRaspberry label) and green (from the TUNEL stain detecting apoptosis). Therefore, the most prominent and immediate observation is the colocalization of the green and red signals.\n\n<<<B>>>"
