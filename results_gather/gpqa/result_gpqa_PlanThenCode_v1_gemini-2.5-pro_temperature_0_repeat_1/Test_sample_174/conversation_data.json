    "PLAN\n1.  Model the oscillating spheroid charge distribution as an oscillating electric dipole, as this is the simplest and most common source of radiation with this geometry.\n2.  Recall or derive the formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` from an oscillating electric dipole, focusing on its dependence on the angle `θ`.\n3.  Identify the angle `θ` at which the radiated power is maximum (`A`). Use this to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°`.\n4.  Analyze the dependence of the radiated power `(dP/dΩ)` on the angular frequency `ω`.\n5.  Relate the angular frequency `ω` to the wavelength `λ` to determine the dependence of the radiated power on `λ`.\n6.  Combine the results from steps 3 and 5 to select the correct option from the given choices and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_radiation_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the physics problem about an oscillating spheroid charge distribution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Part 1: Calculate the fraction of maximum power at theta = 30 degrees\n\n    # The radiated power per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an oscillating electric\n    # dipole along the z-axis is given by:\n    # dP/dΩ ∝ sin^2(θ)\n    # where θ is the angle with the z-axis.\n\n    # The maximum power, A, occurs when sin^2(θ) is maximum.\n    # The maximum value of sin^2(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90 degrees.\n    # So, A is proportional to 1.\n\n    # We need to find the power at θ = 30 degrees.\n    theta_deg = 30\n    theta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n    # The power at 30 degrees is proportional to sin^2(30).\n    power_factor_at_30 = math.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\n    # The fraction of the maximum power A is (power at 30 deg) / (max power)\n    # Fraction = (k * sin^2(30)) / (k * sin^2(90)) = sin^2(30) / 1\n    fraction = power_factor_at_30\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculating the power fraction at theta = {theta_deg} degrees.\")\n    print(f\"Radiated power is proportional to sin^2(theta).\")\n    print(f\"Maximum power A is at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\")\n    print(f\"At theta = {theta_deg} degrees, the power is proportional to sin^2({theta_deg}) = {fraction:.2f}.\")\n    print(f\"The fraction of maximum power A is therefore {fraction:.2f}, which is 1/4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Part 2: Determine the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength λ\n\n    # The radiated power per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is also proportional to\n    # the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω) of the oscillation.\n    # dP/dΩ ∝ ω^4\n\n    # The angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the formula:\n    # ω = 2 * π * f = 2 * π * (c / λ), where c is the speed of light.\n    # So, ω ∝ 1/λ\n\n    # Substituting this into the power relation:\n    # dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)^4\n    # dP/dΩ ∝ λ^(-4)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determining the dependence on wavelength (lambda).\")\n    print(\"Radiated power is proportional to omega^4 (ω^4).\")\n    print(\"Angular frequency omega (ω) is proportional to 1/lambda (1/λ).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the radiated power is proportional to (1/λ)^4 = λ^(-4).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Conclusion\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The fraction of A radiated at 30 degrees is 1/4.\")\n    print(\"A possible form of the function f is proportional to λ^(-4).\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option A.\")\n\nsolve_radiation_problem()\n```",
    "The code models the oscillating spheroid as an electric dipole. The analysis shows two key results:\n\n1.  **Power Fraction:** The radiated power is proportional to `sin^2(θ)`. The maximum power `A` occurs at `θ = 90°` (`sin^2(90°) = 1`). At `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `sin^2(30°) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30° is 0.25, or 1/4.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence:** The radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency (`ω^4`). Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (`ω ∝ 1/λ`), the power is proportional to `(1/λ)^4`, or `λ^(-4)`.\n\nCombining these results, the fraction is 1/4 and the functional form is `λ^(-4)`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
