    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Analyze the first reaction, which converts a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile) using NaCN and reagent A.\n2.  Recognize this as a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon. The resulting alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated. A source of protons, like H3O+, is required for this step.\n3.  Evaluate the options for A. H3O+ is a standard proton source for this reaction, while NaHSO3 is used for a different type of addition reaction. This narrows the possibilities to options A and C.\n4.  Analyze the second reaction, which converts a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n5.  Determine that the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is typically catalyzed by a strong acid (like HCl) or a strong base.\n6.  Evaluate the options for B from the remaining choices (A and C). HCl is a strong acid and an effective catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis, whereas CH3COOH is a weak acid and less suitable. Therefore, B is HCl. This points to option C as the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes two chemical reactions to determine the correct reagents A and B.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    # This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.\n    # The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (from NaCN)\n    # on the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation of the resulting alkoxide ion.\n    # A proton source is needed for this protonation step.\n    # H3O+ (hydronium ion, formed by adding a strong acid like HCl to water) is a\n    # standard reagent for this purpose.\n    # NaHSO3 is used for forming bisulfite adducts, which is a different reaction.\n    # Therefore, A = H3O+.
