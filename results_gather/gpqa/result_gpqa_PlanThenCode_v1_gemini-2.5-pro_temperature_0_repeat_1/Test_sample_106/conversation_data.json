    "The Python script successfully evaluated four potential strategies for preparing the complex molecule Xantheraquin for in silico docking. It concluded that simply using the most stable form (A) is too risky, combining with in vitro assays (B) is a later validation step, and focusing on ADME properties (D) is premature. The script identified that the most critical initial step is to generate a comprehensive library of all relevant chiral and tautomeric forms and then prioritize them based on physicochemical properties. This ensures that the subsequent, computationally expensive docking studies are both efficient and have the highest chance of identifying the true bioactive conformation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
