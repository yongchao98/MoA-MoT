    "This problem requires applying the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in the Hydrogen atom and understanding the concept of branching ratios for cascade decays.\n\n### PLAN\n1.  **Identify States and Transitions:** Define the initial state |3,0,0⟩, the final state |1,0,0⟩, and the intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩. The problem specifies a two-step dipole transition, implying the intermediate state is |2,l',m'⟩.\n2.  **Apply Selection Rules (Step 1):** Use the electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1) to determine the possible intermediate states |2,l',m'⟩ that can be reached from the initial state |3,0,0⟩.\n3.  **Apply Selection Rules (Step 2):** Verify that the possible intermediate states found in the previous step can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩ according to the same selection rules.\n4.  **Calculate Branching Ratios:** Determine the relative probability of the first transition, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,l',m'⟩, for each allowed value of m'. This is the branching ratio for populating the intermediate states.\n5.  **Determine Overall Path Probability:** Explain that the total decay rate from any of the intermediate |2,1,m'⟩ states to the final |1,0,0⟩ state is independent of m'. Therefore, the probability of a specific cascade path is determined solely by the branching ratio of the first step.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option:** Compare the calculated path and probability with the given options (A, B, C, D) and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_transition_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the H-atom transition problem based on selection rules and probabilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

    "The Python script successfully analyzed the two-step dipole transition from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state of the Hydrogen atom.\n\nHere is a summary of the execution:\n1.  **First Transition Selection Rules:** For the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,l',m'⟩, the electric dipole selection rules (Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1) were applied. Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l'=1. Since the initial state has m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = -1, 0, or +1. This results in three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n2.  **Second Transition Selection Rules:** The script verified that all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0⟩, as the transitions satisfy Δl = -1 and Δm is either 0 or ±1.\n3.  **Probability Calculation:** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. Therefore, it decays with equal probability into each of the three available intermediate channels (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩). The probability for any single path is thus 1/3.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The script compared this result with the given options. Option B presents a valid transition path, |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩, and correctly states the probability as 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
