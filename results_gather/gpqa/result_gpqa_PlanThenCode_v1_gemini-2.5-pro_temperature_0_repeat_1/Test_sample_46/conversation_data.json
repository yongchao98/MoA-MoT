    "*   **PLAN**\n1.  Calculate the degree of unsaturation from the molecular formula C9H11NO2 to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n2.  Analyze the IR spectrum to identify key functional groups. The bands at 3420/3325 cm-1 suggest a primary amine (-NH2), and the band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely an ester due to its frequency.\n3.  Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the structure of the alkyl and aromatic parts of the molecule.\n4.  Piece together the fragments identified from the IR and NMR spectra: a primary amine, an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen, and a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n5.  Assemble the full structure, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n6.  Confirm that this structure matches all the spectral data and the molecular formula, and then identify it among the given choices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data provided:\n    # Formula: C9H11NO2\n    # IR: 3420, 3325 cm-1 (medium-strong), 1720 cm-1 (strong)\n    # 1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\")\n    # Formula: C9H11NO2\n    # Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    # DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    print(\"Degree of Unsaturation for C9H11NO2 is 5.\")\n    print(\"This suggests a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a C=O.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of IR Spectrum\")\n    print(\"IR band at 3420 & 3325 cm-1: The two bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\")\n    print(\"IR band at 1720 cm-1: This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.

    "Based on the analysis, the compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The calculation confirms 5 degrees of unsaturation, consistent with a benzene ring (4) and a carbonyl group (1).\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:** The two bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2). The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a conjugated ester carbonyl group.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** The data reveals an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-OCH2CH3), a primary amine group (-NH2), and a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts of the aromatic protons confirm that the electron-donating amine group and the electron-withdrawing ester group are para to each other.\n\nThis complete set of evidence points unambiguously to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
