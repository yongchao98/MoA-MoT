    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Equation:** The problem asks for the ratio of atomic populations in different energy levels at different temperatures. This is described by the Boltzmann equation, which relates population numbers to energy levels and temperature.\n2.  **Formulate the Ratios:** Write down the Boltzmann equation for the population ratio (N₂/N₁) at the two given temperatures: T_nospots (6000 K) and T_spots (5500 K).\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Difference:** The energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels is not given directly but can be calculated from the transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å) using the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n4.  **Calculate the Factor:** The required factor is the ratio of the population ratios: (Ratio at 6000 K) / (Ratio at 5500 K). By dividing the two Boltzmann equations, the statistical weights cancel out, leaving an expression involving ΔE, the Boltzmann constant (k), and the two temperatures.\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** Substitute the values for the physical constants and temperatures into the final expression and calculate the numerical result.\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** Compare the calculated factor with the given multiple-choice options to find the closest match.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN\n# 1.

    "The code successfully calculated the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two different energy levels changes when the star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K.\n\nThe calculation was based on the Boltzmann equation. First, the energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels was determined using the provided transition wavelength of 1448 Å. Then, the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at the two temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) was computed. This yielded a factor of approximately 4.51. Comparing this result to the given options, it most closely matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
