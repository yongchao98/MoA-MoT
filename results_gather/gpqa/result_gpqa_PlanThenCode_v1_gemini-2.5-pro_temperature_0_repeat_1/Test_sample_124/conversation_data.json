    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the system as a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n2.  Recall or derive the energy eigenvalue formula for this system, which is `E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω`, where `N = n_x + n_y + n_z` is the principal quantum number.\n3.  Determine the value of `N` that corresponds to the third excited state. The ground state is `N=0`, so the third excited state is `N=3`.\n4.  Calculate the energy for `N=3` using the formula from step 2.\n5.  Calculate the degeneracy (the number of different combinations of quantum numbers `n_x, n_y, n_z` that sum to `N=3`). This can be found by direct enumeration or using the degeneracy formula `g_N = (N+1)(N+2)/2`.\n6.

    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe Python code correctly identifies the following:\n1.  The energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_N = (N + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number.\n2.  The ground state corresponds to $N=0$. Therefore, the first, second, and third excited states correspond to $N=1$, $N=2$, and $N=3$, respectively.\n3.  For the third excited state ($N=3$), the energy is $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n4.  The degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $N$) is calculated by the formula $g_N = (N+1)(N+2)/2$.\n5.  For $N=3$, the degeneracy is $g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThe calculated energy is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
