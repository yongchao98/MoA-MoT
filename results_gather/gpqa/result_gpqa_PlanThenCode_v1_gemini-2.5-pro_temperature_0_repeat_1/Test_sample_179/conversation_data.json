    "Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the necessary physical constants: the elementary charge `e`, Coulomb's constant `k`, and the golden ratio `phi`. Also, define the given parameters: the charge of each particle `q` and the radius `r`.\n2.  The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two parts: the energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 shell charges (`U_center_shell`), and the energy from the interactions among the 12 shell charges themselves (`U_shell_shell`).\n3.  The `U_center_shell` is constant because the distance `r` is fixed for all 12 shell charges. It is calculated as `12 * k * q^2 / r`.\n4.  To find the minimum total energy, the `U_shell_shell` component must be minimized. This occurs when the 12 charges arrange themselves into a regular icosahedron on the surface of the sphere (the solution to the Thomson problem for N=12).\n5.  Calculate the energy of the icosahedral configuration, `U_shell_shell`. This can be expressed as `(k * q^2 / r) * E_12`, where `E_12` is a dimensionless geometric factor for the icosahedron.\n6.  Sum the two energy components to find the total minimum energy of the system, `U_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`, and print the result in scientific notation with three decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# PLAN\n# 1.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the minimum potential energy of the described system. The total energy was determined by summing two components: the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges, and the interaction energy among the 12 shell charges themselves. The minimum energy configuration for the 12 charges on the sphere is a regular icosahedron. The script calculated the energy for this specific arrangement.\n\nThe calculated minimum energy is 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ Joules, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
