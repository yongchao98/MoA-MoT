    "The Python code successfully solved the problem by applying the principles of special relativity. It began by defining the speed of light in the moving glass frame as `u' = c/n`, which simplifies to `1/n` since `c=1`. It then used the relativistic velocity addition formula, `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`, to find the speed `u` as seen by the laboratory observer. By substituting the expressions for `u'` and `c` and performing algebraic simplification, the code correctly derived the final velocity as `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
