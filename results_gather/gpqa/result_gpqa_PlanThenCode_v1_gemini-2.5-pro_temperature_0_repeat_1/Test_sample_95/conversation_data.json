    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define all necessary physical constants (Gravitational constant G, speed of light c, Boltzmann constant k_B, reduced Planck constant h_bar) and conversion factors in SI units.\n2.  Store the given values: distance `d` in parsecs and angular size `theta` in degrees.\n3.  Convert the distance `d` from parsecs to meters and the angular size `theta` from degrees to radians.\n4.  Calculate the Schwarzschild radius `R_s` of the black hole using the small-angle approximation, where the diameter is `d * theta_rad`, so the radius is `(d * theta_rad) / 2`.\n5.  Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy `S` using the formula involving the Schwarzschild radius: `S = (k_B * pi * c^3 * R_s**2) / (G * h_bar)`.\n6.

    "The Python script successfully calculated the entropy of the supermassive black hole. First, it converted the given distance and angular size into SI units. Then, using the small-angle approximation, it determined the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole's event horizon. Finally, it applied the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula to find the entropy. The calculated value was approximately 1.20 x 10^62 J/K, which has an order of magnitude of 10^62. This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
