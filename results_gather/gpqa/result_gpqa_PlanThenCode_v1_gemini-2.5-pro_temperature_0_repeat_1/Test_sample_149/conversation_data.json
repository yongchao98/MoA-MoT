    "*   PLAN\n1.  Deduce the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR spectrum. The degree of unsaturation and characteristic chemical shifts will be key.\n2.  Identify the product after the first reaction step (NaNO2 + HCl), which is a diazotization reaction of a primary aromatic amine.\n3.  Determine the product after the second reaction step (H2O), which involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt formed in the previous step.\n4.  Analyze the final reaction step (aq. KOH, Heat) on the product from step 3. Recognize this as a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation reaction.\n5.  Determine the structure of the final condensation product, which is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde due to the presence of heat.\n6.  Compare the final product structure to the given options (A, B, C, D) and print the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the multi-step organic chemistry synthesis problem.\n    It does not perform calculations but prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the starting material\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the Starting Material (C8H9NO)\")\n    print(\" - Molecular Formula: C8H9NO\")\n    print(\" - Degree of Unsaturation: 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5.

    "The Python script successfully deduced the multi-step organic synthesis problem.\n\n1.  **Starting Material Identification:** The script correctly identified the starting compound C8H9NO as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde by analyzing its degree of unsaturation and interpreting the provided 1H-NMR data. The key signals were the aldehyde proton, the para-substituted aromatic protons, the primary amine protons, and the alpha-methylene protons.\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence Analysis:**\n    *   Steps 1 and 2 (NaNO2/HCl, then H2O) correctly identified a Sandmeyer-type reaction sequence that converts the primary aromatic amine into a phenol, yielding 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   Step 3 (aq. KOH, Heat) was correctly identified as a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation. The script correctly reasoned that the presence of heat would cause dehydration of the initial aldol addition product to form the more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n3.  **Final Product Identification:** The final product was determined to be 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which is the result of the self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This structure matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
