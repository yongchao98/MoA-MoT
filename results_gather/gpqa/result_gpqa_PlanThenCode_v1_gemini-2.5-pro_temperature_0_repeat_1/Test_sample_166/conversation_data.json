    "Here is a plan to calculate the non-Gaussianity of the Schrödinger cat state:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Problem**: The non-Gaussianity (nG) is given by the relative entropy `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`. The state `|psi>` is a pure state, so its density matrix `rho` has a von Neumann entropy `S(rho) = 0`. The problem thus simplifies to calculating the entropy `S(tau)` of the reference Gaussian state.\n2.  **Characterize the Reference State**: The reference Gaussian state `tau` is defined as the Gaussian state having the same first and second moments as the state `rho`. We need to calculate these moments for the given cat state with `alpha = 0.5` and `phi = -pi/4`.\n3.  **Calculate Moments**: For the specified \"odd\" cat state, the relevant moments are `<a>`, `<a^2>`, and `<a_dagger a>`. We will derive their analytical expressions in terms of `alpha`.\n4.  **Determine the Covariance Matrix**: Using the calculated moments, we will construct the covariance matrix `V` of the reference state `tau`.\n5.  **Find the Symplectic Eigenvalue**: The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its single symplectic eigenvalue, `v`, which can be calculated from the determinant of the covariance matrix: `v = sqrt(det(V))`.\n6.  **Calculate Entropy**: Finally, we will use the formula for the entropy of a Gaussian state, `S(tau) = (v + 1/2)ln(v + 1/2) - (v - 1/2)ln(v - 1/2)`, to find the non-Gaussianity and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_non_gaussianity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state.\n\n    The nG is measured by the relative entropy between the state's density\n    matrix (rho) and that of a reference Gaussian state (tau).\n    nG = S(tau) - S(rho).\n    For a pure state like the one given, S(rho) = 0, so nG = S(tau).\n    The entropy S(tau) is calculated from the state's first and second moments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
