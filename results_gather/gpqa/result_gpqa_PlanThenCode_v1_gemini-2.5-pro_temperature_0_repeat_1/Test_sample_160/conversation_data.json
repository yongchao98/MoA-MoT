    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the two scenarios for mean free path (MFP): λ1 for gas-gas collisions and λ2 for electron-gas collisions.\n2.  Recall the general formula for MFP, λ = 1/(nσ), and how it's modified for moving targets, λ = 1/(√2 * nσ), where 'n' is the number density and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n3.  Compare the collision cross-sections. For gas-gas collisions (σ1), the effective diameter is the sum of two gas molecule radii (d ≈ 2r_gas). For electron-gas collisions (σ2), the electron's radius is negligible, so the effective diameter is just the gas molecule's radius (d ≈ r_gas). This implies σ1 ≈ 4σ2.\n4.  Formulate the expressions for λ1 and λ2. λ1 uses the √2 factor and σ1. λ2 does not use the √2 factor (as gas molecules are effectively stationary for high-speed electrons) and uses σ2.\n5.  Calculate the ratio λ2/λ1 by combining the differences in the √2 factor and the cross-sections (σ).\n6.  Compare the calculated ratio to the given options to determine the correct relationship between λ2 and λ1.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The mean free path (MFP) of a particle is the average distance it travels between collisions.\n# The general formula depends on the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n# Scenario 1: Gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules (λ1)\n# The target gas molecules are also in motion. This introduces a factor of sqrt(2) in the denominator.\n# The collision cross-section, σ1, depends on the effective collision diameter, which is the sum of the radii of two identical gas molecules (r_gas).\n# σ1 = π * (r_gas + r_gas)^2 = π * (2*r_gas)^2 = 4 * π * r_gas^2\n# So, λ1 = 1 / (math.sqrt(2) * n * σ1)\n\n# Scenario 2: Electrons colliding with gas molecules (λ2)\n# The electrons are moving at very high speeds (from 1000 kV acceleration), so the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n# The sqrt(2) factor is not used.\n# The collision cross-section, σ2, depends on the effective collision diameter, which is the sum of the radii of a gas molecule (r_gas) and an electron (r_electron).\n# The radius of an electron is negligible compared to a gas molecule (r_electron << r_gas).\n# σ2 = π * (r_gas + r_electron)^2 ≈ π * (r_gas)^2\n# So, λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Define the relationship between the collision cross-sections.\")\nprint(\"σ1 (gas-gas) is proportional to (2 * r_gas)^2 = 4 * r_gas^2\")\nprint(\"σ2 (electron-gas) is proportional to (r_gas)^2\")\nprint(\"Therefore, σ1 ≈ 4 * σ2\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Define the formulas for λ1 and λ2.\")\nprint(\"λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ1)\")\nprint(\"λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the ratio λ2 / λ1.\")\nprint(\"λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ1)]\")\nprint(\"λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ1) / (n * σ2)\")\nprint(\"Canceling 'n' and substituting σ1 ≈ 4 * σ2:\")\nprint(\"λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (4 * σ2) / σ2\")\nprint(\"λ2 / λ1 = 4 * sqrt(2)\\n\")\n\nratio = 4 * math.sqrt(2)\nprint(f\"Step 4: Evaluate the ratio and draw a conclusion.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio λ2 / λ1 is approximately {ratio:.4f}.\")\nprint(f\"This means λ2 ≈ {ratio:.4f} * λ1.\")\nprint(\"Since 5.6568 is significantly greater than 1, we can conclude that λ2 > λ1.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 5: Compare with the given options.\")\nprint(f\"A) λ2 = λ1 -> Incorrect.\")\nprint(f\"B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> Correct, as {ratio:.4f} is much larger than 1.22.\")\nprint(f\"C) λ2 < λ1 -> Incorrect.\")\nprint(f\"D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> Incorrect.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe mean free path of the electrons (λ2) is significantly longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1).\")\n\n```\nThe code executed successfully.\n\nThe analysis compares the mean free path (MFP) for two scenarios: gas-gas collisions (λ1) and electron-gas collisions (λ2). The MFP is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ) and a factor related to relative particle motion.\n\n1.  **Collision Cross-Section:** The cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (σ1) is roughly four times larger than that for a tiny electron hitting a gas molecule (σ2), because σ is proportional to the square of the effective collision radius.\n2.  **Relative Motion:** For gas-gas collisions, the targets are also moving, which introduces a √2 factor that decreases the MFP. For very fast electrons hitting relatively stationary gas molecules, this factor is absent.\n\nCombining these effects, the ratio λ2/λ1 is calculated to be 4√2, which is approximately 5.66. This result shows that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Comparing this result with the given options, the only one that holds true is λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The code successfully determined the relationship between the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) and the mean free path of high-speed electrons colliding with those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\nThe analysis is based on two key physical differences:\n1.  **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** The effective target area for a gas-gas collision (σ1) is larger than for an electron-gas collision (σ2). Since the electron's size is negligible, σ1 is approximately four times σ2.\n2.  **Relative Velocity:** The formula for λ1 includes a √2 factor to account for the motion of the target gas molecules. This factor is absent for λ2 because the high-speed electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules, making the targets effectively stationary.\n\nCombining these factors, the code calculated the ratio λ2 / λ1 to be 4√2, which is approximately 5.66. This means λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Comparing this result to the given options, the only one that is correct is B, as 5.66 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22.\n\n<<<B>>>"
