    "The Python script analyzed the molecular consequences of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein. In a heterozygous state, both wild-type (WT) and mutant (Y) protein subunits are produced. These can form three types of dimers: functional WT-WT dimers, and non-functional WT-Y and Y-Y dimers. The key feature of a dominant-negative mutation is that the mutant Y protein binds to the WT protein, forming a non-functional WT-Y complex. This \"poisons\" the wild-type protein, effectively causing a loss of function of the wild-type allele. This interference and the potential for the cell to degrade these abnormal complexes make option B the most accurate description of the molecular phenotype.\n\n<<<B>>>"
