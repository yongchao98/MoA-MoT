    "The analysis determined the correct formula for the radiatively generated mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson `H2` by applying the principles of the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The correct formula must be dimensionally consistent and correctly account for the signs of loop contributions from different particle types.\n\nThe key findings were:\n1.  **Dimensionality:** The mass-squared (`M^2`) must have dimensions of `[Mass]^2`. The formula must be of the form `M^4 / M^2`, which eliminates Option B.\n2.  **Supertrace Signs:** Bosonic particles (scalars and vector bosons) contribute positively to the supertrace, while fermionic particles contribute negatively.\n3.  **Particle Content:** All heavy particles that couple to the scalar sector must be included.\n\nOption A is the only choice that satisfies all these criteria: it is dimensionally correct, it includes all the specified particles (`h1`, `W`, `Z`, `t`, `H+/-`, `H0`, `A0`, `N_i`), and it correctly assigns a positive sign to all boson contributions and a negative sign to all fermion contributions (`-M_t^4` and `-ΣM_N_i^4`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
