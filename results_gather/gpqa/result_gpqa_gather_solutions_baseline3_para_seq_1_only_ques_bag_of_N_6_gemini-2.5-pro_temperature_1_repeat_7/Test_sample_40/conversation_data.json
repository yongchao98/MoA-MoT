Let's break down the problem into different frames of reference.\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   Let **S'** be the rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The light beam is propagating through the glass. Its speed is defined by the index of refraction, `n`. The index of refraction `n` relates the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`) as measured in the rest frame of the medium. The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of the light beam in the rest frame of the glass (frame S') is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n    *   The problem states that the glass is moving in the *same direction* as the beam. So, `v` and `u'` have the same sign.\n\n3.  **Apply the Lorentz Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S'). We found this to be `1/n`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S). This is given as `v`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, given as `c = 1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * (1 + v/n) )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated speed `u` is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option B.\n\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\nThe correct answer is (1+n*v)/(n+v).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let S be the laboratory frame (the observer's frame), which is stationary.\n    *   Let S' be the rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S, in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame S' (the glass) relative to the stationary frame S (the lab) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within the glass* (in its own rest frame, S') is given by the definition of the index of refraction, `n = c/u'`, where `u'` is the speed of light in the medium. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We want to find the speed of light `u` in the laboratory frame S.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities at speeds close to the speed of light, so we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, not the classical Galilean one. The formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom by `n`:\n    `u = ( n * [ (1/n) + v ] ) / ( n * [ 1 + v/n ] )`\n    `u = ( (n * 1/n) + (n * v) ) / ( (n * 1) + (n * v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.

The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`. Because the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, we take this velocity as positive.\n    *   **u**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (Frame S).

Let's break down the problem into different frames of reference.\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   Let **S'** be the rest frame of the glass. This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The light beam is propagating through the glass. Its speed is defined by the index of refraction, `n`. The index of refraction `n` relates the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`) as measured in the rest frame of the medium. The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the speed of the light beam in the rest frame of the glass (frame S') is `u' = c / n = 1 / n`.\n    *   The problem states that the glass is moving in the *same direction* as the beam. So, `v` and `u'` have the same sign.\n\n3.  **Apply the Lorentz Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (S'). We found this to be `1/n`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (S') relative to the stationary frame (S). This is given as `v`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, given as `c = 1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / ( n * (1 + v/n) )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated speed `u` is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.

This frame is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S, in the same direction as the light beam.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame S' (the glass) relative to the stationary frame S (the lab) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within the glass* (in its own rest frame, S') is given by the definition of the index of refraction, `n = c/u'`, where `u'` is the speed of light in the medium. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We want to find the speed of light `u` in the laboratory frame S.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities at speeds close to the speed of light, so we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, not the classical Galilean one.

The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`. Because the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, we take this velocity as positive.\n    *   **u**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (Frame S).
