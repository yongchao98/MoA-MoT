Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a calculation to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a double bond, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in the region above 3300 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an **ester (R-C(=O)-OR')**. The fact that it's slightly lower than the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a simple alkyl ester suggests that the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The signal is a triplet (t), meaning it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). It integrates to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is classic for a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The signal is a quartet (q), meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). It integrates to 2 protons (2H). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (deshielding) of the methylene protons to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons. This chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Both are doublets (d), and each integrates to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split into two sets of two equivalent protons. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests that one substituent on the ring is strongly electron-donating, and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating group. An amine (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing group. An ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we have an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to a benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying with the Options\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. The C=O stretch would be at a much lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group (CH₃CH₂COO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show the CH₂ of the propionyl group around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with appropriate NMR shifts.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester. The substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester C=O stretch (typically 1715-1750 cm-1), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet represents the -CH3 group split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH2 group. The quartet represents the -CH2 group split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH3 group. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen atom, suggesting an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have very different electronic properties. One must be electron-donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm), and the other must be electron-withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  We have a primary amine group (-NH2), which is electron-donating.\n    3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n    4.  This assembly gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data perfectly. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with electron-donating and withdrawing groups.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group alpha to the carbonyl at around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal around 8-9 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets. Also, as an amide, its C=O IR frequency would likely be lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's features like rings or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O) or a ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in the 3300-3500 cm-1 region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The specific frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This C=O group accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4). This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n        *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can confidently identify an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the CH2 group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This suggests an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), likely as part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to exchange and quadrupolar effects of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, as are the two on the other side. They split each other into doublets.\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Placing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a -CONH2 (amide) group, not an ester and a primary amine. The IR C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm-1). Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2CO-), not the oxygen. The CH2 signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2). The IR would show only one N-H band. Incorrect.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The strong IR band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a C=O double bond, which accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine (R3N) would show none.\n    *   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester (typically 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for an amide (usually 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. One is electron-donating (shielding the ortho/meta protons), and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the ortho/meta protons).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH2) group. Its chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline (aminobenzene) derivative.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester accounts for the C=O from the IR and the ethyl group from the NMR.\n    3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group. The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    4.  Placing these groups in a para- (1,4-) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group should be upfield (shielded), which corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group should be downfield (deshielded), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This is consistent with the data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This has a propionate group. The NMR would show a -C(=O)-CH2- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two simple doublets. Also, the IR for an amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, so the IR would show only one N-H band, not two. It would also have a very downfield formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (like a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only one band.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (around 1735 cm-1), which is slightly lowered by conjugation with the aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group (according to the n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group in an ethyl fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) indicates it is adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets that each integrate to 2 protons is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester group, -COOR).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring that is para-substituted (from NMR).\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine, -NH2 (from IR and NMR).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3 (from IR and NMR).\n    4.  This structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and is an amide, not an ester.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (R-CO-CH2CH3), which would place the quartet signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data (which shows a primary amine) and the NMR data (which shows 2 amine protons).\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the para-substituted aromatic ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine signals in the 1H NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 1 ring and 3 double bonds, totaling 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the symmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the asymmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O group. A standard alkyl ester is around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹, but when the ester is conjugated with an aromatic ring, the frequency is lowered, making 1720 cm⁻¹ a very plausible value. This is too high for a typical amide (~1650 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This combination of a triplet (t) for 3 protons and a quartet (q) for 2 protons is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) at 1.20 ppm is split into a triplet by its two neighbors on the CH₂ group.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) at 4.5 ppm is split into a quartet by its three neighbors on the CH₃ group. Its downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of the ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This is a broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum. These protons are often broad due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The doublet at 7.0 ppm is further upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following structural fragments:\n*   An ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-(para) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate (CH₃CH₂COO-). The -CH₂- group would be next to the C=O, not the oxygen, and its signal would be around 2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃. This perfectly matches all the IR and NMR data. The formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct. **Correct.**\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a meta-substitution pattern, which would not give two doublets in the NMR. Also, it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. **Incorrect.**\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and integrate to 1H in the NMR. It would also have a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) around 8-9 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the presence of two oxygen atoms and a strong IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The fact that there are two doublets, each integrating to two protons, means the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, which is what you see in a para-substituted pattern (AA'BB' system that often appears as two doublets). The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 vs 8.0 ppm) suggests one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, shifting them upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons, combined with the IR data, confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH₂) group. The chemical shift is typical for an aniline-type amine. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the characteristic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet at a downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which is oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is more consistent with an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) than an ether (-Ar-OCH₂CH₃, which would be closer to 4.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    3.  The -NH₂ group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it should be shielded (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    4.  The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it should be deshielded (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n    This assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR and the 2H integration of the amine signal.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. It is also an amide, not an ester.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and ¹H NMR).\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this structure, the ethyl group is part of a propionate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear much further upfield (around 2.2-2.5 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating DBE is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (2/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A primary amide (-CONH2) could also show two bands, but this, combined with other data, points strongly to an amine. This evidence makes option A (a secondary amide) unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a simple amide (usually < 1690 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester like in option D (usually > 1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two groups on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is consistent with protons ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is consistent with protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n    *   This observation eliminates option **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region and Other Signals:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. Crucially, the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is very downfield, indicating the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** found in an ester.\n    *   This eliminates option **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-C(=O)CH2CH3). In that case, the quartet for the -CH2- group would be much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound has a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. The data shows a primary amine (-NH2). So, this is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2. (Correct)\n    *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (two N-H bands) and a conjugated ester (C=O at ~1720 cm⁻¹). (Matches)\n    *   **NMR:** Shows a para-substituted ring (two doublets), an ethyl group attached to oxygen (t at 1.2, q at 4.5 ppm), and a primary amine signal (broad singlet, 2H). (Matches perfectly)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 from the given spectral data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n*   X = 0 (halogen atoms)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to a benzene ring).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** It is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   This suggests the `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** It is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significant downfield shift, indicating the -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative atom, almost certainly the oxygen of the ester (`-COO-CH₂-`).\n    *   Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those on an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH).\n    *   Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration:** A total of 4 protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the aromatic protons, shifting them upfield. The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields protons, shifting them downfield.\n        *   The upfield doublet at **7.0 ppm** corresponds to the two protons ortho to the activating -NH₂ group.\n        *   The downfield doublet at **8.0 ppm** corresponds to the two protons ortho to the deactivating -COOEt group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound has:\n1.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and functional group (amide, not ester).\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Contains a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the connectivity is different (`-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`). The NMR for the propionate's -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula, the DoU, the primary amine and conjugated ester from IR, and all the signals (ethyl group, NH₂, para-disubstituted ring) in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is:\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n\nFor C9H11NO2:\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically be at a lower frequency (e.g., 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a carbonyl group, most likely from a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a -CH₂- group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), i.e., a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the -CH₂- group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom, forming an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH₂ groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is definitively assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is for aromatic protons. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The aromatic ring has two different substituents. One must be electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and one must be electron-withdrawing (shifting ortho protons downfield). The -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   The doublet at 7.0 ppm (more upfield) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group.\n        *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm (more downfield) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be attached to a carbonyl, giving a -CH₂- signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different (e.g., one N-H band, formyl proton signal).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the given data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 typically corresponds to a benzene ring. The remaining DBE of 1 suggests an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to a double bond or aromatic ring), which typically absorbs around 1715-1730 cm-1.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant chemical shift difference between the two doublets suggests one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting ortho protons downfield).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This points to an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group. This would account for the upfield aromatic signal (~7.0 ppm).\n    3.  The other pieces are an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) and a carbonyl group (C=O). The IR and NMR data suggest they form an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester group is electron-withdrawing.\n    4.  Placing the electron-withdrawing ester group on the benzene ring would deshield the ortho protons, accounting for the downfield aromatic signal (~8.0 ppm).\n    5.  The proposed structure is an -NH2 group and a -COOCH2CH3 group at the 1 and 4 positions of a benzene ring. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n    *   **Formula Check:** C6H4(ring) + NH2 + C(O)O + C2H5 = C9H11NO2. The formula is correct.\n    *   **Spectra Check:** The structure is fully consistent with all the provided IR and NMR data. The primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and para-substituted ring are all clearly identified.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine/ester.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is meta-substituted and an amide.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), whose -CH2- quartet would appear around 2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all the data perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated using the formula:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm-1 is typical for a conjugated ester. An unconjugated ester would be slightly higher (~1735-1750 cm-1), while a conjugated ketone or aldehyde would also be in this range. The conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet (t) integrating to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This strongly suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet (q) integrating to 2 protons (2H). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.20 ppm, confirming the ethyl group. The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester linkage (R-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for protons that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The amino group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm value). The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm value).\n    *   The doublet at **7.0 ppm** is assigned to the two protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group.\n    *   The doublet at **8.0 ppm** is assigned to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine, and it has a formyl proton (CHO). This is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3-disubstituted) ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a 1,4-disubstituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group. It perfectly matches all the data: the IR bands for -NH2 and conjugated ester, and all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum (ethyl group, NH2 protons, and the para-substituted aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester (Ar-O-C=O), not an ethyl ester (R-C(=O)-O-Et). In this case, the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-COCH2CH3), and its -CH2- signal would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from the IR and 1H NMR spectra overwhelmingly supports the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for DoU is: C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nDoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\nDoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\nDoU = 5\nA DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond, likely a C=O bond.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂ group). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially an α,β-unsaturated or aromatic ester.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) next to the methyl group (-CH₃) identified above, confirming the presence of an ethyl group. The chemical shift is significantly downfield (4.5 ppm), which indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, and the chemical shift and integration are consistent with the primary amine (-NH₂) protons identified in the IR spectrum. The position suggests it's attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a highly characteristic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split only by their single ortho neighbor, resulting in two doublets. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\nFrom the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An ethyl ester group: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring\n\nThe two substituents on the benzene ring are the amine (-NH₂) and the ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The -NH₂ group is electron-donating, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nPlacing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The molecular formula for this compound is C₉H₁₁NO₂, which matches the given information.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all IR and NMR data perfectly.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a meta-substitution pattern, which would produce a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two doublets.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate (H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃): This is an isomer, but it's a phenyl ester. The -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The signal at 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a -CH₂- attached to an ester oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the data unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is highly indicative of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (above 3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester**, specifically one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from a typical aliphatic ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal step-by-step:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a group with n=2 protons, i.e., a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methylene group is adjacent to a group with n=3 protons, i.e., a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a methylene group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen.\n    *   **Conclusion from 1.20 and 4.5 ppm signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together form the signature pattern of an **ethoxy group attached to the ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.0 ppm) and Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the two protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. Amine protons are often broad due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (total 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), confirming the presence of a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons are split into two groups. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group. The -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group (shields protons), and the ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (deshields protons). This pattern fits perfectly.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nCombining these pieces, we have an ethyl ester of a benzoic acid with an amino group at the para (4) position. The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Choice**\n\nLet's re-examine the correct option:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂ - Correct.\n    *   IR: Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester C=O. - Correct.\n    *   ¹H NMR: Has a para-substituted ring, an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, and an -NH₂ group. All chemical shifts and multiplicities match the data. - Correct.\n\nThis compound, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester** (typically 1750-1735 cm⁻¹) or possibly an aromatic ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is the most likely functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into three lines, which means it's adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a methylene (-CH₂-) group. This suggests a `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into four lines, meaning it's adjacent to a group with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), i.e., a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Conclusion from 1.20 & 4.5 ppm:** Together, these two signals confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very high (downfield) chemical shift for a CH₂ group. This indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ester: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal for 2H in this region is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is caused by the quadrupole moment of the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration (2H + 2H = 4H) confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Relative Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at the lower field (more deshielded) of **8.0 ppm** must be ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), such as the ester's carbonyl group. The doublet at the higher field (more shielded) of **7.0 ppm** must be ortho to an electron-donating group (EDG), such as the amino group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get a structure where the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group are attached to the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with the correct electronic effects influencing the proton chemical shifts.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the \"ethyl\" part is from a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). The CH₂ in this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 typically suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an alkyl ester conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and fits an ester perfectly.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (7.0 - 8.0 ppm):**\n        *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring split each other, resulting in two distinct signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic and Functional Group Region:**\n        *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the tell-tale sign of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n            *   The triplet (t) for 3H is the -CH₃ group, split by the adjacent -CH₂ group.\n            *   The quartet (q) for 2H is the -CH₂ group, split by the adjacent -CH₃ group.\n            *   The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly significant. It indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-**O**-CH₂-).\n        *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a **b**road **s**inglet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\n*   From the DBE and NMR, we have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) **. This is an electron-donating group.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together on the para-substituted ring gives us the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Benzene ring (C₆H₄) + amine (NH₂) + ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) = C(6+1+2)H(4+2+5)NO₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. **Matches.**\n*   **IR:** Primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester C=O. **Matches.**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl group with -CH₂- at ~4.5 ppm. **Matches.**\n    *   -NH₂ protons as a broad singlet. **Matches.**\n    *   Para-substituted ring pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group will be shielded (upfield), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded (downfield). This perfectly explains the doublet at **7.0 ppm** (ortho to -NH₂) and the doublet at **8.0 ppm** (ortho to -COOEt). **Matches perfectly.**\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has a meta-substitution pattern, inconsistent with the para-pattern (two doublets) in the NMR. Also, the C=O is an amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency in the IR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** All data points align perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the oxygen, and its chemical shift would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThus, the only structure that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O bond).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium to strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). This rules out structures with secondary amines (-NH-), amides, or nitro groups.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester group (C=O), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's a bit high for a typical conjugated ketone or amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its splitting pattern is a triplet (t). This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, and its splitting is a quartet (q). This indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of this methylene group being attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-CH₂-). This, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to quàdrupole coupling with the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen bonding.

This symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring must be different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n    Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verifying the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data (formula C9H11NO2, IR, and all NMR signals).\n    *   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two.

Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer of A. Its structure is CH₃CH₂COO-Ar-NH₂. The NMR would show a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, with a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The NMR data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), not a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-).

Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n    *   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n    *   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which is 1 DBE).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of absorptions is highly characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aromatic ester (conjugated with a benzene ring). It's too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group) shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing group (the ester group, -COOEt) deshields its adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verification with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂), which would have a different IR C=O stretch (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹). The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex (meta-substitution).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- group would appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It would also have a distinct formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8.2 ppm in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: C₉H₁₁NO₂ formula, primary amine N-H stretches, conjugated ester C=O stretch, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with one donating and one withdrawing group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct absorption bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH2). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch. This immediately makes option D (a secondary amide, which would only have one N-H stretch) unlikely.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester carbonyl group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. Amide carbonyls (Options C and D) usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). This suggests the compound is a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield). This finding rules out option C (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 3-substituted (meta) and would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet (t) arises from the -CH3 group being split by the adjacent -CH2- group (2 neighbors, n+1=3). The quartet (q) arises from the -CH2- group being split by the adjacent -CH3 group (3 neighbors, n+1=4). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester or ether.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group that we identified from the IR spectrum. The signal is broad due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   The data points to a molecule with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2) group, and an ethyl group attached to an ester.\n    *   Let's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with an -NH2 group and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this structure against the data one last time.\n        *   **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: It has the correct formula C9H11NO2. It has a primary amine and a conjugated ester, matching the IR. It has a para-disubstituted ring, explaining the two doublets in the NMR. The electron-donating -NH2 group shields its ortho protons (at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (at 8.0 ppm). The signals for the ethyl group and the amine protons are also fully consistent.\n    *   Let's see why other options are wrong:\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: In this ester, the ethyl group would be CH3-CH2-C=O. The -CH2- group would be next to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is meta-substituted, which contradicts the NMR's para-substitution pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester, which is less consistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n        *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, which would only show one N-H stretch in the IR, contradicting the two bands observed. It also lacks the signal for a formyl proton (~8-8.5 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about the structure.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This strongly suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1690 cm⁻¹) but is characteristic of an ester. The position around 1720 cm⁻¹ specifically suggests an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a triplet. A triplet (3 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) in an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons that are a quartet. A quartet (4 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a CH3 group). The high chemical shift (downfield) at 4.5 ppm indicates this CH2 group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is an oxygen atom. This signal, combined with the one at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: -O-CH2-CH3. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals in this region are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH2 group. Combined with the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal is confidently assigned to the -NH2 protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two groups of two equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (more shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (more deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n\n**4. Conclusion and Structure Determination**\n\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have identified the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A *para*-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   Assembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: The ethyl ester group and the amino group are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Let's check this against the options:\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be -CO-CH2CH3. The CH2 here would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at ~2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Also, the C=O stretch in the IR would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also only has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch. It is also *meta*-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as follows:\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (which accounts for 1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (approx. 1750-1735 cm-1), especially a conjugated one.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The coupling of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the quartet suggests the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift, combined with the IR data, confirm the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts mean the two substituents are different electronically. One is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the nearby protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm). The other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields the nearby protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl group part of an ester: **-COOCH2CH3**. This is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    2.  We have a primary amine group: **-NH2**. This is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    3.  We have a benzene ring that is **para-substituted** with the EDG and the EWG.\n    4.  Placing the -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3 groups at positions 1 and 4 on a benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure. The protons ortho to the -NH2 group would be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -COOCH2CH3 group would be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data derived from our analysis.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has an amide C=O (wrong IR freq), a meta-substitution pattern (wrong NMR splitting), and an ethoxy group instead of an ethyl ester.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H band in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This ester (4-H2N-C6H4-O-C(=O)CH2CH3) would show a quartet for the -CH2- protons around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as:\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n        DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   `3420 cm-1` and `3325 cm-1`: The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   `1720 cm-1`: This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1740 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   `1.20 ppm (t, 3H)` and `4.5 ppm (q, 2H)`: This triplet-quartet pair is the characteristic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at a high value like 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   `4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR spectrum.\n    *   `7.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, signify a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of aromatic protons are coupled to each other. The significant difference in their chemical shifts implies that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The doublet at the lower field (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the doublet at the higher field (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    4.  Let's verify the molecular formula of this structure: C6H4 (ring) + C (carbonyl) + O + OCH2CH3 + NH2 = C(6+1+2)H(4+5+2)N1O2 = C9H11NO2. The formula matches.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two -NH peaks in the IR. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular formula, DBE, IR, and NMR).\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This compound has a propionate group (CH3CH2COO-), not an ethyl ester group. The -CH2- group next to the carbonyl would appear as a quartet around 2.5-2.8 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester. The conjugation with the benzene ring would normally lower this frequency slightly, but 1720 cm-1 is well within the expected range for an aromatic ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large chemical shift difference between the two doublets suggests the ring is substituted with one strong electron-donating group (EDG) and one strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    *   **Ethyl Group:**\n        *   The signal at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as indicated by the triplet splitting (2+1=3 peaks).\n        *   The signal at **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-), as indicated by the quartet splitting (3+1=4 peaks). The very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-).\n        *   Together, these two signals confirm the presence of an ethoxy group that is part of an ester: -O-CH2CH3.\n    *   **Amine Protons:** The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons.

The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2), which is an EDG, and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an EWG.\n    3.

The triplet (t) corresponds to the 3 protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) being split by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group. The quartet (q) corresponds to the 2 protons of the methylene group (-CH₂) being split by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar moment.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a tell-tale sign of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to each other, and the same is true for the protons on the other side. The upfield doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at ~8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring.\n    2.  It is para-disubstituted (from the two doublets in the NMR).\n    3.  One substituent is a primary amine, -NH₂ (from IR and NMR).\n    4.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group, -COOCH₂CH₃ (from IR and the ethyl pattern in the NMR).\n    5.  Combining these fragments gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionate group (-COCH₂CH₃). The quartet for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is an amide, not an ester, which contradicts the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It is also a secondary amine, which contradicts the two N-H bands in the IR.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide (wrong IR C=O frequency) and it is meta-disubstituted, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectral data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring + three double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity):** These two distinct peaks in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong intensity):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The conjugation lowers the frequency from the usual 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a saturated ester.\n\n**IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t = triplet):** The triplet means it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). This points to a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q = quartet):** The quartet means it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 3+1=4). This confirms the -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   **Combined:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group** (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs = broad singlet):** This is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), confirming the benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The aromatic protons are split into two groups. One set is relatively upfield (more shielded) at 7.0 ppm, and the other is significantly downfield (more deshielded) at 8.0 ppm. This indicates that one substituent on the ring is electron-donating (shields the adjacent protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshields the adjacent protons).\n        *   The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group, which would shield the ortho protons, shifting them upfield. The signal at 7.0 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the ortho protons, shifting them downfield. The signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's see which proposed structure fits all the data:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has an amide group, which is inconsistent with the ester C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR spectrum, not two doublets.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This molecule has a propionate group (-OCOC₂H₅), not an ethyl ester group. The NMR would show a triplet and quartet in the aliphatic region (for -CH₂CH₃), but the quartet would be around 2.2-2.5 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This molecule has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. This contradicts the IR data indicating a primary amine.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ - **Correct.**\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ethyl ester. - **Correct.**\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Contains an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), matching the triplet and quartet.\n        *   Contains a primary amine (-NH₂), matching the broad singlet.\n        *   Has a 1,4-disubstituted ring with an electron-donating (-NH₂) and electron-withdrawing (-COOEt) group, matching the two aromatic doublets.\n\nAll spectroscopic data points are consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 usually indicates the presence of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (which is typically < 1700 cm⁻¹) but fits well for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Integration:** The total number of protons is 3H + 2H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 11H, which matches the molecular formula.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (since the multiplicity is a triplet, n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (since the multiplicity is a quartet, n+1=4, so n=3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly indicates the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift (downfield) of the quartet at 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The protons on nitrogen often exhibit broad signals due to quadropolar relaxation and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), both appearing as doublets and each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at a higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) is likely ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl), while the doublet at a lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together:**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The C=O is directly attached to the ring, and the ethyl group is attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is 4-aminobenzoic acid, ethyl ester, also known as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data. It has a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group arranged in the correct way to explain the NMR shifts.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted ring (would give a more complex aromatic pattern), and it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. Here the ester linkage is different (-O-CO-CH2CH3). The -CH2- of the ethyl group would be adjacent to the C=O, not the ester oxygen, and would appear much further upfield (around 2.5 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine, which contradicts the IR spectrum showing two N-H bands.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as follows:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests the presence of a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH2). This rules out secondary amines or amides with only one N-H bond.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group of a conjugated ester. Amides usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the carbonyl ester). The upfield shift of the doublet at 7.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group, which was also identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.  From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  From IR and NMR, one substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    3.  From IR and NMR, the other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    4.  The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are the ones at 8.0 ppm.\n    5.  The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group are the ones at 7.0 ppm.\n    \n    Assembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would show a meta-splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets. The IR for the amide C=O would be at a lower frequency.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ester linkage is different (-O-CO-R). The -CH2- group of the propionate would be next to the carbonyl, giving a signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band. The NMR would show a proton for the N-H and another for the formyl (-CHO) proton.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get an initial idea of the structure.\n*   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   Where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a double bond (e.g., C=O) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks in the N-H stretching region is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2 group). A primary amine has two N-H bonds, leading to two vibrational modes (symmetric and asymmetric stretching).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is too high for a simple ketone or an amide but is in the typical range for an ester, specifically a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring). The conjugation lowers the frequency from a typical saturated ester (~1740 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester (-COO-R) group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet splitting (n+1=3) means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n=2), likely a methylene (-CH2-) group. This suggests an ethyl group fragment (-CH2-CH3).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet splitting (n+1=4) means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n=3), which must be the methyl group seen at 1.20 ppm.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significant downfield shift for a CH2 group. It is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **Combined evidence:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3) that is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and proton exchange. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** These are four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This clean \"doublet of doublets\" pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent and are split by the two protons on the other side.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The presence of two distinct signals means the two substituents on the ring are different. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) is next to a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), while the upfield signal (7.0 ppm) is next to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n        *   The ester group (-COOEt) is an EWG.\n        *   The amino group (-NH2) is an EDG.\n        *   This confirms that the -NH2 and -COOEt groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The structure is therefore ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly. It has a C9H11NO2 formula, a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ester oxygen is attached to the ring. This would give a CH2 quartet at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The IR C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹), and it would be a secondary amide (one N-H peak in IR). The NMR would show a formyl proton (H-C=O) singlet around 8.2 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester (wrong IR). It is also meta-substituted, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds to stretch.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an **ester** (usually 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for a typical amide (which would be ~1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, suggesting a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t):** It's a triplet, which means its neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This points to a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, suggesting a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q):** It's a quartet, which means its neighboring carbon has 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH2 group. It indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester: -O-CH2-CH3.\n*   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs):** A broad singlet is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an -OH or -NH group. Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the **-NH2** protons. The broadness is due to quadupole relaxation and/or chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are 4 protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d + d):** The presence of two doublets is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the chemically non-equivalent aromatic protons to split each other. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound contains:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nThese fragments can only be assembled in one way: the amine and the ethyl ester groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It has a secondary amide (not a primary amine) and an ether (not an ester). The IR and NMR would be significantly different.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is an amide (wrong C=O frequency) and is meta-substituted (would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the alkyl chain is attached to the carbonyl carbon (-OCOCH2CH3). The NMR for the CH2 group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1.

IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Given the aromaticity suggested by the DBE, this value is consistent with a conjugated ester. A typical non-conjugated ester appears around 1735-1750 cm-1; conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency into this range.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H, which confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   The chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (causing the upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm for its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (causing the downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm for its ortho protons).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This pair of signals is the signature pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   The 1.20 ppm signal is a triplet (t) because the 3 protons of the methyl (CH3) group are coupled to the 2 protons of the adjacent methylene (CH2) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   The 4.5 ppm signal is a quartet (q) because the 2 protons of the methylene (CH2) group are coupled to the 3 protons of the adjacent methyl (CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester or ether. Combined with the C=O group from the IR, an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, is strongly indicated.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons is highly characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put all the identified pieces together:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPlacing these two groups in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   The electron-donating -NH2 group would shield its ortho protons, pushing them upfield (the signal at 7.0 ppm).\n*   The electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group would deshield its ortho protons, pushing them downfield (the signal at 8.0 ppm). This is a perfect match for the observed aromatic signals.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (wrong IR) and a formyl proton (not in NMR).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data: primary amine (IR, NMR), conjugated ester (IR), para-substituted ring with correct electronic effects (NMR), and an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (NMR). The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is a primary amide (amide C=O is ~1680 cm-1, not 1720 cm-1) and has meta substitution (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), so the CH2 quartet would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **5**\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is conjugated with a benzene ring. This could be a conjugated ester or ketone. Given the molecular formula contains two oxygen atoms, an **ester (-COO-)** is very likely. An ester C=O conjugated to an aromatic ring typically appears around 1730-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group, following the n+1 rule where 2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃- group, where 3+1=4).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are coupled and indicate the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet each):** This distinct pattern of two doublets is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different (one electron-donating, one electron-withdrawing), creating this symmetrical pattern.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have identified the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nPlacing these fragments together, the amine group and the ester group must be the two substituents on the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n*   **-COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl ester):** The -CH₃ gives the triplet at 1.20 ppm, and the -O-CH₂- gives the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This fits.\n*   **-NH₂ (amine):** The two amine protons give the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. This fits.\n*   **Para-substituted ring:** The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, and the amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded (appear upfield), corresponding to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (appear downfield), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This arrangement fits the data perfectly.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide, not an ester, and is meta-substituted. Incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our derived structure and all spectral data. Correct.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester. It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO). Incorrect.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester of phenol (-O-CO-R), not a benzoic acid ester (-CO-O-R). The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet for this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group. A primary amide (-CONH2) also shows two bands, but a secondary amide (like in option D) would show only one.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency gives clues to the type of carbonyl group.\n        *   Standard alkyl esters (-COOR) are typically around 1750-1735 cm-1.\n        *   Amides (-CONH2) are typically lower, around 1690-1650 cm-1.\n        *   The value of 1720 cm-1 is slightly low for a simple ester, which suggests the ester group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The presence of an electron-donating group on the ring (like -NH2) can further lower this frequency. This piece of data points towards a conjugated ester, such as an aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) signifies that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   Putting these two signals together (the triplet at 1.20 and the quartet at 4.5), we can confidently identify an **ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3)**. The chemical shift of the quartet is consistent with it being part of an ester (-COO-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 hydrogens. This is consistent with the protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum. The protons on nitrogen are often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The protons near the electron-donating group are shielded (appear at a lower ppm, upfield), while the protons near the electron-withdrawing group are deshielded (appear at a higher ppm, downfield).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    From the fragments identified:\n    1.  A primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    Let's place these groups on the para-disubstituted ring. This gives us **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   The structure is H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3.\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group are expected to be upfield (around 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are expected to be downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n    *   This matches the NMR data perfectly. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. All spectral data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Other Options**\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CO-CH2- group around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. Also, the NMR would have a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) above 8 ppm, which is absent.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only compound that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines exhibit two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester group, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a carbonyl group, most likely from an ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group) (3+1=4).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as oxygen.\n    *   **Combined Analysis (1.20 & 4.5 ppm):** The triplet-quartet pair is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms it is an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Shape (bs, broad singlet):** A broad singlet for 2H is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Broadening is common due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet & d, doublet):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and split the two protons ortho to the other substituent (and vice versa), resulting in two doublets.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester is formed on the phenyl ring's oxygen, which doesn't match the NMR.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine, not a primary one.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which fits with the IR data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (**-NH2**) group. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but is usually coupled with a lower frequency C=O stretch.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n    *   Combining these two points, the data suggests the presence of both a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is a classic signature for a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (**-NH2**). The broadness is due to rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These are two doublets in the aromatic region of the spectrum, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   An amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, which shields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a higher field/lower ppm).\n        *   An ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a lower field/higher ppm).\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on all the evidence, we have:\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n    Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group. Its NMR signal (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would be around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and the broad 2H signal for -NH2 in the NMR.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has a primary amide (-CONH2), which typically has a C=O stretch below 1700 cm-1. Also, the 1,3-(meta) substitution pattern would give a more complex set of signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring + three double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands arise from the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the range for an ester (typically 1735-1750 cm-1). Conjugation with the benzene ring (which we suspect from the DoU) would lower this frequency slightly, making 1720 cm-1 a very reasonable value for a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (a methyl group, -CH3). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a methylene group, -CH2-), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH2-**CH3**).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons (a methylene group, -CH2-). Its multiplicity is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a methyl group, -CH3-). The chemical shift is significantly downfield (deshielded), which indicates it's attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. This signal is the methylene part of an ethyl group that is attached to an oxygen, as in an ethyl ester (-O-**CH2**-CH3).\n    *   *Combining these two signals*, we can confidently identify an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group we identified from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts are due to the electronic effects of the two different substituents. One substituent is electron-donating (the -NH2 group), which shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm). The other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, -COOEt), which deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  This assembly gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer but would have a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet in the alkyl region), not an ethyl ester group.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR spectrum (would show one N-H stretch, not two). It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO) around 8 ppm, which is not observed.\n    *   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the DoU, the IR signals for -NH2 and a conjugated ester, and all the 1H NMR signals (para-substituted ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine protons).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double/triple bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none in this region.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl stretching region. This frequency is typical for an ester (R-CO-O-R'). Aldehydes and ketones are usually at a similar frequency, but amides are typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, appearing as a triplet. This is a classic pattern for a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, appearing as a quartet. This corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n    *   *Putting these two together:* The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly indicate the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is significantly downfield, which means the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). Given the high shift, an ester linkage is very likely.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns perfectly with the IR data. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting the ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH2) is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOR) is a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This molecule has a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). All fragments identified from the spectra are present in this structure. The amino group (electron-donating) and ester group (electron-withdrawing) are para to each other, which would produce the observed two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region. This structure perfectly matches all data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of the propionyl side (CH3CH2CO-). The -CH2- protons of the propionyl group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2), which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and NMR (2H broad singlet) data.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This compound is a primary amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Furthermore, it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe data from the molecular formula, IR, and 1H NMR spectra all point unequivocally to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is highly suggestive of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet at a high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) means the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to 2 protons, confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH2) group seen in the IR spectrum. The broadening is common for amine protons due to exchange and quadrupolar relaxation.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have an **ester C=O** and an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)**. This combines to form an ethyl ester group, **-COOCH2CH3**.\n\nPutting these fragments together on a para-substituted benzene ring, the structure must be **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the data:\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2 (Correct)\n*   **IR:** Has an -NH2 group and a conjugated ester C=O. (Correct)\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   An ethoxy group gives a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and a quartet at ~4.5 ppm. (Correct)\n    *   A primary amine gives a broad 2H signal. (Correct, at 4.0 ppm)\n    *   A para-substituted ring with a donating group (-NH2) and a withdrawing group (-COOEt). The protons ortho to the donating -NH2 will be upfield (observed at 7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt will be downfield (observed at 8.0 ppm). (Correct)\n\n**5. Evaluating other options:**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta) and incorrect functional group (amide instead of ester).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect ester structure. The quartet for -C(=O)CH2- would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (shows a primary amine) and the NMR (shows a -NH2, not a -NH-).\n\nThe only candidate that perfectly matches all the provided spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - 0 + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\nDoU = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is characteristic of an ester (R-COO-R'). It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) or a simple ketone conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t = triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks), which is a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q = quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks), which is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This confirms the -CH2-CH3 fragment (an ethyl group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield chemical shift for a -CH2- group. This indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom that is part of an ester group (-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Appearance (bs = broad singlet):** A broad signal that does not show clear splitting is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2).\n    *   Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The two sets of protons are chemically non-equivalent. The protons giving the signal at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (next to an electron-withdrawing group), and the protons giving the signal at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (next to an electron-donating group).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put the identified fragments together:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) - This is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) - The carbonyl part (-COO-) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe two substituents, -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3, must be attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. The electron-donating -NH2 group will cause the adjacent aromatic protons to appear at a higher field (more shielded, ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group will cause its adjacent protons to appear at a lower field (deshielded, ~8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\nThe resulting structure is: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a CH2 group signal around 2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is a secondary amide (not primary), would have a different IR C=O stretch and N-H signal.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has meta-substitution which would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets. Also, it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a C=O carbonyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is the hallmark of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively. This rules out secondary amides or amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, this value is characteristic of an ester (~1750-1715 cm⁻¹). It is generally too high for an amide (~1690-1650 cm⁻¹) or a ketone conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n### **3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield, which means this CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl ester group: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂** group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two groups on the ring cause the four aromatic protons to split into two chemically distinct pairs. One group is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group), and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, -COOR). The electron-donating group shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing group deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data, we have the following structural fragments:\n1.  An ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n4.  A carbonyl group as part of the ester.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: a benzene ring with an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options provided:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H stretches in the IR spectrum. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets. Also, an amide C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency than 1720 cm⁻¹. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group, C=O, which accounts for 1 DoU).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated ester. An amide carbonyl would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1). This suggests the presence of a -C(=O)O- group attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to the -CH2- part of the -CH2-CH3 fragment identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH2- group, which indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-COOCH2-). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals in this region are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those of an amine (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) group. Given the IR data, this confirms the primary amine (-NH2).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting (d, d):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly deshielded, indicating they are ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded, indicating they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the primary amine, -NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) attached to the ring.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the ring.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound with an amide. It would not give the para-substituted NMR pattern and the IR for the C=O group is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester. It perfectly matches all the data: formula C9H11NO2, IR signals for -NH2 and conjugated ester, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a para-disubstituted ring, and a primary amine.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR showing two N-H bands.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this structure, the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2-C=O), not the ester oxygen. The -CH2- protons would be around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   We first calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of ~1720 cm-1 is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly an aryl ester (an ester group attached to a benzene ring). It is too high for a simple amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) means the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester linkage (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This signal, in combination with the IR data, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH2)** protons. The signal is broad due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts mean the two substituents on the ring are electronically different. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho (adjacent) to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    4.  Combining these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Checking the Alternatives**\n    *   A) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: Matches all data.\n    *   B) **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Is a secondary amide (not primary amine) and has an ether linkage. Would not match IR or NMR.\n    *   C) **4-aminophenyl propionate**: The ester is H2N-Ph-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group next to the C=O would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) **3-ethoxybenzamide**: Is meta-substituted (not para), so the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex. Also, it's a primary amide, and the IR C=O stretch is typically lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - 11/2 - 0/2 + 1/2\n        DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    2.  A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    1.  **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n    2.  **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms and the chemical formula, this is likely an **ester** group (-COOR). The frequency is a bit high for a simple alkyl ester but is characteristic of an aryl ester or an ester conjugated with a double bond (like the benzene ring), which is consistent with our DoU calculation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    1.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   The chemical shifts (7.0-8.0 ppm) indicate protons on an aromatic ring.\n        *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   The large difference in chemical shifts between the two doublets suggests the two substituents have opposite electronic effects: one is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing. The electron-donating group shields the *ortho* protons (lower ppm, ~7.0), while the electron-withdrawing group deshields its *ortho* protons (higher ppm, ~8.0).\n    2.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n        *   This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) at 1.20 ppm is a triplet because it's adjacent to the two protons of the -CH2- group (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n        *   The methylene group (-CH2-) at 4.5 ppm is a quartet because it's adjacent to the three protons of the -CH3 group (n+1 = 3+1=4).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester: **-O-CH2-CH3**.\n    3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n        *   The integration (2H) and the broadness of the signal (bs = broad singlet) are consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** group identified from the IR spectrum. The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and/or chemical exchange. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amino group attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group. The protons *ortho* to this group should be the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group. The protons *ortho* to this group should be the downfield aromatic doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n    The structure is therefore 4-aminobenzoic acid, ethyl ester, which is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Structure:\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n      - C - O - CH2 - CH3\n      |\n     / \\\n    |   |\n    |   |\n     \\ /\n      |\n      NH2\n    ```\n    This structure matches the molecular formula (C9H11NO2), the IR data (-NH2 and ester C=O), and all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: An amide, not an ester. Incorrect.\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all data. Correct.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of a propanoyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). The NMR for the CH2 group would be ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is an amide, not an ester (wrong C=O IR frequency). Also, it is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex NMR aromatic pattern. Incorrect.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining DBE of 1 suggests an additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to an aromatic ring).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) with three protons. The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), most likely a methylene (-CH2-) group. This suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-) with two protons. The quartet (q) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), confirming it is coupled to the methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which is characteristic of an oxygen in an ester (R-COO-CH2-). Thus, we have an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet represents two exchangeable protons, which is consistent with the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n    3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n    The structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group appear upfield (7.0 ppm).\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n    *   This structure matches the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n    *   This structure is consistent with all spectral data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of a propionate (-OCOCH2CH3), and its -CH2- signal would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR would show a single N-H band and an amide carbonyl stretch at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional double bond (like C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)** group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for an **ester C=O group**, especially when it is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, typical of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) implies it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal, along with the next one, suggests an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, typical of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) implies it is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is highly deshielded. A chemical shift greater than 4.0 ppm for a CH₂ group is characteristic of it being bonded to an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-**CH₂**-R').\n    *   **Conclusion:** The signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are very common for protons attached to nitrogen (or oxygen) due to hydrogen bonding and rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.0 ppm):** This shift is consistent with an **amino group (-NH₂)** attached directly to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the -NH₂ group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Suggests four protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** In a 1,4-disubstituted ring, one substituent is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n        *   The amino group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, shielding the adjacent protons and shifting them upfield (to a lower ppm value). The signal at **7.0 ppm** is therefore assigned to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group.\n        *   The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding the adjacent protons and shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value). The signal at **8.0 ppm** is therefore assigned to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An ethyl ester group: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has all the required features: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring. It is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. It would have a -CO-CH₂-CH₃ group. The -CH₂- group would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an amine. The IR would show a single N-H stretch, and the carbonyl would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹). It would also have only one NH proton in the NMR. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide and is 1,3- (meta) substituted. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern (not two doublets), and the IR would show amide signals. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that fits all the provided spectral data (molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR) is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 1 ring and 3 double bonds, totaling 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is the characteristic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an **ester C=O group**. A standard alkyl ester absorbs around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹, but when the ester is conjugated with an aromatic ring, the frequency is lowered. This value is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This combination of a triplet (t) for 3 protons and a quartet (q) for 2 protons is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) at 1.20 ppm is split into a triplet by its two neighbors on the CH₂ group.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) at 4.5 ppm is split into a quartet by its three neighbors on the CH₃ group. Its very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester group (**-COOCH₂CH₃**).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This is a broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The doublet at 7.0 ppm is further upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following structural fragments:\n*   A 1,4-(para) disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   An ethyl ester group: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n\nPlacing these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's verify this against the options provided in the prompt:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a meta-substitution pattern, which would not give two doublets in the NMR. Also, it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃. This perfectly matches all the IR and NMR data. The formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group would be next to the C=O, not the oxygen, and its signal would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and integrate to 1H in the NMR.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure, which corresponds to option B in the question's list.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is a calculation to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a double bond, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in the region above 3300 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an **ester (R-C(=O)-OR')**. The fact that it's slightly lower than the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a simple alkyl ester suggests that the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The signal is a triplet (t), meaning it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). It integrates to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is classic for a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The signal is a quartet (q), meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). It integrates to 2 protons (2H). This is the corresponding methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (deshielding) of the methylene protons to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons. This chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). Both are doublets (d), and each integrates to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring are split into two sets of two equivalent protons. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests that one substituent on the ring is strongly electron-donating, and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating group. An amine (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing group. An ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we have an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to a benzene ring at the 1 and 4 positions. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying with the Options\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. The C=O stretch would be at a much lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group (CH₃CH₂COO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show the CH₂ of the propionyl group around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with appropriate NMR shifts.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, not an ester. The substitution pattern is meta (1,3), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), which is suggested by the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out structures with secondary or tertiary amines.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of an ester C=O stretch (typically 1715-1750 cm-1), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which is usually below 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is a definitive signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet represents the -CH3 group split by the adjacent two protons of the -CH2 group. The quartet represents the -CH2 group split by the adjacent three protons of the -CH3 group. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is an oxygen atom, suggesting an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have very different electronic properties. One must be electron-donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm), and the other must be electron-withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  We have a primary amine group (-NH2), which is electron-donating.\n    3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n    4.  This assembly gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data perfectly. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with electron-donating and withdrawing groups.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), not an ethoxy group. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group alpha to the carbonyl at around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Contains a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal around 8-9 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) isomer, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets. Also, as an amide, its C=O IR frequency would likely be lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's features like rings or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O) or a ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in the 3300-3500 cm-1 region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The specific frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This C=O group accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) means it's adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) means it's adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4). This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) next to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n        *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can confidently identify an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the CH2 group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This suggests an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), likely as part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is very typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to exchange and quadrupolar effects of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, as are the two on the other side. They split each other into doublets.\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is likely due to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Placing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a -CONH2 (amide) group, not an ester and a primary amine. The IR C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm-1). Incorrect.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2CO-), not the oxygen. The CH2 signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2). The IR would show only one N-H band. Incorrect.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2 formula, primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring. The strong IR band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a C=O double bond, which accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine (R3N) would show none.\n    *   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester (typically 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for an amide (usually 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. One is electron-donating (shielding the ortho/meta protons), and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the ortho/meta protons).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. This signal, combined with the IR data, confirms the primary amine (-NH2) group. Its chemical shift is appropriate for an aniline (aminobenzene) derivative.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester accounts for the C=O from the IR and the ethyl group from the NMR.\n    3.  The amine group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group. The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    4.  Placing these groups in a para- (1,4-) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure with the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group should be upfield (shielded), which corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group should be downfield (deshielded), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This is consistent with the data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This has a propionate group. The NMR would show a -C(=O)-CH2- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two simple doublets. Also, the IR for an amide C=O would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, so the IR would show only one N-H band, not two. It would also have a very downfield formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and 1H NMR).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (like a C=O carbonyl group, which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only one band.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (around 1735 cm-1), which is slightly lowered by conjugation with the aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1680 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group (according to the n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). This is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group in an ethyl fragment.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet multiplicity (q) indicates it is adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH2-). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is typical for the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2) group. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets that each integrate to 2 protons is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, meaning they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester group, -COOR).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring that is para-substituted (from NMR).\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine, -NH2 (from IR and NMR).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3 (from IR and NMR).\n    4.  This structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and is an amide, not an ester.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (R-CO-CH2CH3), which would place the quartet signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data (which shows a primary amine) and the NMR data (which shows 2 amine protons).\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the para-substituted aromatic ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine signals in the 1H NMR.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 1 ring and 3 double bonds, totaling 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the symmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the asymmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O group. A standard alkyl ester is around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹, but when the ester is conjugated with an aromatic ring, the frequency is lowered, making 1720 cm⁻¹ a very plausible value. This is too high for a typical amide (~1650 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This combination of a triplet (t) for 3 protons and a quartet (q) for 2 protons is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) at 1.20 ppm is split into a triplet by its two neighbors on the CH₂ group.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) at 4.5 ppm is split into a quartet by its three neighbors on the CH₃ group. Its downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of the ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This is a broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum. These protons are often broad due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The doublet at 7.0 ppm is further upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following structural fragments:\n*   An ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-(para) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate (CH₃CH₂COO-). The -CH₂- group would be next to the C=O, not the oxygen, and its signal would be around 2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃. This perfectly matches all the IR and NMR data. The formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct. **Correct.**\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a meta-substitution pattern, which would not give two doublets in the NMR. Also, it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. **Incorrect.**\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and integrate to 1H in the NMR. It would also have a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) around 8-9 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the presence of two oxygen atoms and a strong IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The fact that there are two doublets, each integrating to two protons, means the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, which is what you see in a para-substituted pattern (AA'BB' system that often appears as two doublets). The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 vs 8.0 ppm) suggests one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons, shifting them upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons, combined with the IR data, confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH₂) group. The chemical shift is typical for an aniline-type amine. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the characteristic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The quartet at a downfield chemical shift of 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which is oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is more consistent with an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) than an ether (-Ar-OCH₂CH₃, which would be closer to 4.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    3.  The -NH₂ group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it should be shielded (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    4.  The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it should be deshielded (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n    This assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR and the 2H integration of the amine signal.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. It is also an amide, not an ester.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular Formula, DBE, IR, and ¹H NMR).\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: In this structure, the ethyl group is part of a propionate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- group would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear much further upfield (around 2.2-2.5 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1.

Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A primary amide (-CONH2) could also show two bands, but this, combined with other data, points strongly to an amine. This evidence makes option A (a secondary amide) unlikely.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two groups on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is consistent with protons ortho to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n        *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is consistent with protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n    *   This observation eliminates option **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is 1,3-disubstituted (meta).\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region and Other Signals:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the signature of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. Crucially, the chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is very downfield, indicating the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** found in an ester.\n    *   This eliminates option **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-C(=O)CH2CH3).

Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\nThe formula for DoU is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n*   X = 0 (halogen atoms)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to a benzene ring).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** It is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   This suggests the `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** It is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significant downfield shift, indicating the -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative atom, almost certainly the oxygen of the ester (`-COO-CH₂-`).\n    *   Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those on an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH).\n    *   Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration:** A total of 4 protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the aromatic protons, shifting them upfield. The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields protons, shifting them downfield.\n        *   The upfield doublet at **7.0 ppm** corresponds to the two protons ortho to the activating -NH₂ group.\n        *   The downfield doublet at **8.0 ppm** corresponds to the two protons ortho to the deactivating -COOEt group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound has:\n1.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n3.  These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta, not para) and functional group (amide, not ester).\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Contains a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the connectivity is different (`-O-CO-CH₂CH₃`). The NMR for the propionate's -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula, the DoU, the primary amine and conjugated ester from IR, and all the signals (ethyl group, NH₂, para-disubstituted ring) in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is:\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n\nFor C9H11NO2:\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O) or ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. An amide C=O would typically be at a lower frequency (e.g., 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a carbonyl group, most likely from a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a -CH₂- group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), i.e., a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the -CH₂- group to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom, forming an ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH₂ groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is definitively assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is for aromatic protons. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The aromatic ring has two different substituents. One must be electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and one must be electron-withdrawing (shifting ortho protons downfield). The -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   The doublet at 7.0 ppm (more upfield) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group.\n        *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm (more downfield) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be attached to a carbonyl, giving a -CH₂- signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different (e.g., one N-H band, formyl proton signal).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the given data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 typically corresponds to a benzene ring. The remaining DBE of 1 suggests an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to a double bond or aromatic ring), which typically absorbs around 1715-1730 cm-1.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant chemical shift difference between the two doublets suggests one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting ortho protons downfield).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom. This points to an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group. This would account for the upfield aromatic signal (~7.0 ppm).\n    3.  The other pieces are an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) and a carbonyl group (C=O). The IR and NMR data suggest they form an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The ester group is electron-withdrawing.\n    4.  Placing the electron-withdrawing ester group on the benzene ring would deshield the ortho protons, accounting for the downfield aromatic signal (~8.0 ppm).\n    5.  The proposed structure is an -NH2 group and a -COOCH2CH3 group at the 1 and 4 positions of a benzene ring. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n    *   **Formula Check:** C6H4(ring) + NH2 + C(O)O + C2H5 = C9H11NO2. The formula is correct.\n    *   **Spectra Check:** The structure is fully consistent with all the provided IR and NMR data. The primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and para-substituted ring are all clearly identified.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine/ester.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is meta-substituted and an amide.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), whose -CH2- quartet would appear around 2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all the data perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated using the formula:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm-1 is typical for a conjugated ester. An unconjugated ester would be slightly higher (~1735-1750 cm-1), while a conjugated ketone or aldehyde would also be in this range. The conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet (t) integrating to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This strongly suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet (q) integrating to 2 protons (2H). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.20 ppm, confirming the ethyl group. The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester linkage (R-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for protons that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The amino group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm value). The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm value).\n    *   The doublet at **7.0 ppm** is assigned to the two protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group.\n    *   The doublet at **8.0 ppm** is assigned to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine, and it has a formyl proton (CHO). This is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3-disubstituted) ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a 1,4-disubstituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group. It perfectly matches all the data: the IR bands for -NH2 and conjugated ester, and all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum (ethyl group, NH2 protons, and the para-substituted aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester (Ar-O-C=O), not an ethyl ester (R-C(=O)-O-Et). In this case, the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-COCH2CH3), and its -CH2- signal would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from the IR and 1H NMR spectra overwhelmingly supports the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for DoU is: C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nDoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\nDoU = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\nDoU = 5\nA DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond, likely a C=O bond.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂ group). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially an α,β-unsaturated or aromatic ester.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the upfield part of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) next to the methyl group (-CH₃) identified above, confirming the presence of an ethyl group. The chemical shift is significantly downfield (4.5 ppm), which indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, and the chemical shift and integration are consistent with the primary amine (-NH₂) protons identified in the IR spectrum. The position suggests it's attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a highly characteristic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split only by their single ortho neighbor, resulting in two doublets. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure:**\nFrom the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An ethyl ester group: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring\n\nThe two substituents on the benzene ring are the amine (-NH₂) and the ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The -NH₂ group is electron-donating, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   The -COOCH₂CH₃ group is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nPlacing these groups at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The molecular formula for this compound is C₉H₁₁NO₂, which matches the given information.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all IR and NMR data perfectly.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Has a meta-substitution pattern, which would produce a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two doublets.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate (H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃): This is an isomer, but it's a phenyl ester. The -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The signal at 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a -CH₂- attached to an ester oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the data unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, and N = number of nitrogens.\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is highly indicative of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (above 3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester**, specifically one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from a typical aliphatic ester (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal step-by-step:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a group with n=2 protons, i.e., a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methylene group is adjacent to a group with n=3 protons, i.e., a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a methylene group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen.\n    *   **Conclusion from 1.20 and 4.5 ppm signals:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together form the signature pattern of an **ethoxy group attached to the ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.0 ppm) and Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the two protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. Amine protons are often broad due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (total 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), confirming the presence of a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic fingerprint of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons are split into two groups. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group. The -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group (shields protons), and the ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (deshields protons). This pattern fits perfectly.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n*   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nCombining these pieces, we have an ethyl ester of a benzoic acid with an amino group at the para (4) position. The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Choice**\n\nLet's re-examine the correct option:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂ - Correct.\n    *   IR: Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester C=O. - Correct.\n    *   ¹H NMR: Has a para-substituted ring, an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, and an -NH₂ group. All chemical shifts and multiplicities match the data. - Correct.\n\nThis compound, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester** (typically 1750-1735 cm⁻¹) or possibly an aromatic ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is the most likely functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into three lines, which means it's adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a methylene (-CH₂-) group. This suggests a `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into four lines, meaning it's adjacent to a group with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), i.e., a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Conclusion from 1.20 & 4.5 ppm:** Together, these two signals confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very high (downfield) chemical shift for a CH₂ group. This indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ester: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal for 2H in this region is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is caused by the quadrupole moment of the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration (2H + 2H = 4H) confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Relative Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at the lower field (more deshielded) of **8.0 ppm** must be ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), such as the ester's carbonyl group. The doublet at the higher field (more shielded) of **7.0 ppm** must be ortho to an electron-donating group (EDG), such as the amino group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get a structure where the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group are attached to the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with the correct electronic effects influencing the proton chemical shifts.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the \"ethyl\" part is from a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). The CH₂ in this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 typically suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an alkyl ester conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and fits an ester perfectly.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (7.0 - 8.0 ppm):**\n        *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring split each other, resulting in two distinct signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic and Functional Group Region:**\n        *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the tell-tale sign of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n            *   The triplet (t) for 3H is the -CH₃ group, split by the adjacent -CH₂ group.\n            *   The quartet (q) for 2H is the -CH₂ group, split by the adjacent -CH₃ group.\n            *   The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly significant. It indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-**O**-CH₂-).\n        *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a **b**road **s**inglet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\n*   From the DBE and NMR, we have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) **. This is an electron-donating group.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together on the para-substituted ring gives us the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Benzene ring (C₆H₄) + amine (NH₂) + ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) = C(6+1+2)H(4+2+5)NO₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. **Matches.**\n*   **IR:** Primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester C=O. **Matches.**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl group with -CH₂- at ~4.5 ppm. **Matches.**\n    *   -NH₂ protons as a broad singlet. **Matches.**\n    *   Para-substituted ring pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group will be shielded (upfield), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded (downfield). This perfectly explains the doublet at **7.0 ppm** (ortho to -NH₂) and the doublet at **8.0 ppm** (ortho to -COOEt). **Matches perfectly.**\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has a meta-substitution pattern, inconsistent with the para-pattern (two doublets) in the NMR. Also, the C=O is an amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency in the IR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** All data points align perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the oxygen, and its chemical shift would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThus, the only structure that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O bond).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium to strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). This rules out structures with secondary amines (-NH-), amides, or nitro groups.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester group (C=O), especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's a bit high for a typical conjugated ketone or amide.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its splitting pattern is a triplet (t). This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons, and its splitting is a quartet (q). This indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is highly indicative of this methylene group being attached to an electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-CH₂-). This, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to quàdrupole coupling with the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen bonding. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets (d) in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring must be different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n    Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verifying the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data (formula C9H11NO2, IR, and all NMR signals).\n    *   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer of A. Its structure is CH₃CH₂COO-Ar-NH₂. The NMR would show a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, with a chemical shift around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The NMR data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), not a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-). Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2).\n    *   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n    *   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n    *   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group, which is 1 DBE).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of absorptions is highly characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an aromatic ester (conjugated with a benzene ring). It's too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group) shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield).\n    *   The electron-withdrawing group (the ester group, -COOEt) deshields its adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield).\n    *   Therefore, the doublet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   We have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verification with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂), which would have a different IR C=O stretch (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹). The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex (meta-substitution).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH₃CH₂CO-). The -CH₂- group would appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It would also have a distinct formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8.2 ppm in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: C₉H₁₁NO₂ formula, primary amine N-H stretches, conjugated ester C=O stretch, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with one donating and one withdrawing group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double/triple bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct absorption bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH2). One band corresponds to the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the symmetric N-H stretch. This immediately makes option D (a secondary amide, which would only have one N-H stretch) unlikely.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester carbonyl group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. Amide carbonyls (Options C and D) usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). This suggests the compound is a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift (7.0 ppm vs 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield). This finding rules out option C (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is 3-substituted (meta) and would produce a more complex splitting pattern.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A triplet for 3 protons and a quartet for 2 protons is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The triplet (t) arises from the -CH3 group being split by the adjacent -CH2- group (2 neighbors, n+1=3). The quartet (q) arises from the -CH2- group being split by the adjacent -CH3 group (3 neighbors, n+1=4). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an ester or ether.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group that we identified from the IR spectrum. The signal is broad due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   The data points to a molecule with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2) group, and an ethyl group attached to an ester.\n    *   Let's assemble the pieces: we have a benzene ring with an -NH2 group and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Let's check this structure against the data one last time.\n        *   **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: It has the correct formula C9H11NO2. It has a primary amine and a conjugated ester, matching the IR. It has a para-disubstituted ring, explaining the two doublets in the NMR. The electron-donating -NH2 group shields its ortho protons (at 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (at 8.0 ppm). The signals for the ethyl group and the amine protons are also fully consistent.\n    *   Let's see why other options are wrong:\n        *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: In this ester, the ethyl group would be CH3-CH2-C=O. The -CH2- group would be next to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, and would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is meta-substituted, which contradicts the NMR's para-substitution pattern. It is also an amide, not an ester, which is less consistent with the IR C=O frequency.\n        *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is a secondary amide, which would only show one N-H stretch in the IR, contradicting the two bands observed. It also lacks the signal for a formyl proton (~8-8.5 ppm).\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about the structure.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity bands):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This strongly suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong band):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which is usually below 1690 cm⁻¹) but is characteristic of an ester. The position around 1720 cm⁻¹ specifically suggests an ester group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a triplet. A triplet (3 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) in an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons that are a quartet. A quartet (4 peaks) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a CH3 group). The high chemical shift (downfield) at 4.5 ppm indicates this CH2 group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this case is an oxygen atom. This signal, combined with the one at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: -O-CH2-CH3. This is the \"ethyl\" part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. Broad signals in this region are often due to exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH2 group. Combined with the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal is confidently assigned to the -NH2 protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (or *para*-substituted) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two groups of two equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (more shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH2).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (more deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n\n**4. Conclusion and Structure Determination**\n\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have identified the following fragments:\n    *   A primary amine (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A *para*-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   Assembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: The ethyl ester group and the amino group are attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   Let's check this against the options:\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group would be -CO-CH2CH3. The CH2 here would be adjacent to a carbonyl, not an oxygen, and would appear at ~2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Also, the C=O stretch in the IR would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also only has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch. It is also *meta*-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as follows:\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (which accounts for 1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an ester C=O stretch (approx. 1750-1735 cm-1), especially a conjugated one.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The coupling of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the quartet suggests the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift, combined with the IR data, confirm the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These two signals are doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts mean the two substituents are different electronically. One is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the nearby protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm). The other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields the nearby protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have an ethyl group part of an ester: **-COOCH2CH3**. This is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    2.  We have a primary amine group: **-NH2**. This is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n    3.  We have a benzene ring that is **para-substituted** with the EDG and the EWG.\n    4.  Placing the -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3 groups at positions 1 and 4 on a benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    5.  Let's verify this structure. The protons ortho to the -NH2 group would be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -COOCH2CH3 group would be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data derived from our analysis.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has an amide C=O (wrong IR freq), a meta-substitution pattern (wrong NMR splitting), and an ethoxy group instead of an ethyl ester.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H band in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This ester (4-H2N-C6H4-O-C(=O)CH2CH3) would show a quartet for the -CH2- protons around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as:\n        DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n        DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   `3420 cm-1` and `3325 cm-1`: The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   `1720 cm-1`: This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). The frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency from the usual ~1740 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   `1.20 ppm (t, 3H)` and `4.5 ppm (q, 2H)`: This triplet-quartet pair is the characteristic pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at a high value like 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   `4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR spectrum.\n    *   `7.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, signify a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of aromatic protons are coupled to each other. The significant difference in their chemical shifts implies that one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The doublet at the lower field (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the doublet at the higher field (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    4.  Let's verify the molecular formula of this structure: C6H4 (ring) + C (carbonyl) + O + OCH2CH3 + NH2 = C(6+1+2)H(4+5+2)N1O2 = C9H11NO2. The formula matches.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the two -NH peaks in the IR. It would also have a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data (Molecular formula, DBE, IR, and NMR).\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This compound has a propionate group (CH3CH2COO-), not an ethyl ester group. The -CH2- group next to the carbonyl would appear as a quartet around 2.5-2.8 ppm in the NMR, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This specific frequency is characteristic of an ester. The conjugation with the benzene ring would normally lower this frequency slightly, but 1720 cm-1 is well within the expected range for an aromatic ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is highly characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large chemical shift difference between the two doublets suggests the ring is substituted with one strong electron-donating group (EDG) and one strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n    *   **Ethyl Group:**\n        *   The signal at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as indicated by the triplet splitting (2+1=3 peaks).\n        *   The signal at **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-), as indicated by the quartet splitting (3+1=4 peaks). The very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-).\n        *   Together, these two signals confirm the presence of an ethoxy group that is part of an ester: -O-CH2CH3.\n    *   **Amine Protons:** The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is consistent with the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is typical for amine protons due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with nitrogen.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2), which is an EDG, and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an EWG.\n    3.  Putting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    4.  Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n        *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) would be the most deshielded, corresponding to the signal at **8.0 ppm**.\n        *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2) would be the most shielded, corresponding to the signal at **7.0 ppm**.\n        *   The ethoxy group signals and the amine signal match perfectly.\n        *   The molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is an amide, not an ester. IR C=O would be ~1670 cm-1.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2CO-), and its -CH2- would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the IR and 1H NMR data.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern.

The quartet (q) corresponds to the 2 protons of the methylene group (-CH₂) being split by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to factors like chemical exchange and nitrogen's quadrupolar moment.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a tell-tale sign of a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent to each other, and the same is true for the protons on the other side.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring + three double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity):** These two distinct peaks in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong intensity):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The conjugation lowers the frequency from the usual 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a saturated ester.\n\n**IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t = triplet):** The triplet means it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). This points to a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q = quartet):** The quartet means it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 3+1=4). This confirms the -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   **Combined:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group** (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs = broad singlet):** This is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), confirming the benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The aromatic protons are split into two groups. One set is relatively upfield (more shielded) at 7.0 ppm, and the other is significantly downfield (more deshielded) at 8.0 ppm. This indicates that one substituent on the ring is electron-donating (shields the adjacent protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshields the adjacent protons).\n        *   The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group, which would shield the ortho protons, shifting them upfield. The signal at 7.0 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the ortho protons, shifting them downfield. The signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's see which proposed structure fits all the data:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has an amide group, which is inconsistent with the ester C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR spectrum, not two doublets.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This molecule has a propionate group (-OCOC₂H₅), not an ethyl ester group. The NMR would show a triplet and quartet in the aliphatic region (for -CH₂CH₃), but the quartet would be around 2.2-2.5 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This molecule has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. This contradicts the IR data indicating a primary amine.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ - **Correct.**\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ethyl ester. - **Correct.**\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Contains an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), matching the triplet and quartet.\n        *   Contains a primary amine (-NH₂), matching the broad singlet.\n        *   Has a 1,4-disubstituted ring with an electron-donating (-NH₂) and electron-withdrawing (-COOEt) group, matching the two aromatic doublets.\n\nAll spectroscopic data points are consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 usually indicates the presence of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (which is typically < 1700 cm⁻¹) but fits well for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Integration:** The total number of protons is 3H + 2H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 11H, which matches the molecular formula.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (since the multiplicity is a triplet, n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (since the multiplicity is a quartet, n+1=4, so n=3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly indicates the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift (downfield) of the quartet at 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The protons on nitrogen often exhibit broad signals due to quadropolar relaxation and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), both appearing as doublets and each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at a higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) is likely ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl), while the doublet at a lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together:**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The C=O is directly attached to the ring, and the ethyl group is attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is 4-aminobenzoic acid, ethyl ester, also known as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data. It has a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group arranged in the correct way to explain the NMR shifts.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted ring (would give a more complex aromatic pattern), and it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. Here the ester linkage is different (-O-CO-CH2CH3). The -CH2- of the ethyl group would be adjacent to the C=O, not the ester oxygen, and would appear much further upfield (around 2.5 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine, which contradicts the IR spectrum showing two N-H bands.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as follows:\n        DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (1) suggests the presence of a double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH2). This rules out secondary amines or amides with only one N-H bond.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group of a conjugated ester. Amides usually appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the carbonyl ester). The upfield shift of the doublet at 7.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group, which was also identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.  From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  From IR and NMR, one substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    3.  From IR and NMR, the other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    4.  The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are the ones at 8.0 ppm.\n    5.  The protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group are the ones at 7.0 ppm.\n    \n    Assembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This would show a meta-splitting pattern in the NMR, not two doublets. The IR for the amide C=O would be at a lower frequency.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ester linkage is different (-O-CO-R). The -CH2- group of the propionate would be next to the carbonyl, giving a signal around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band. The NMR would show a proton for the N-H and another for the formyl (-CHO) proton.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get an initial idea of the structure.\n*   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   Where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a double bond (e.g., C=O) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks in the N-H stretching region is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2 group). A primary amine has two N-H bonds, leading to two vibrational modes (symmetric and asymmetric stretching).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is too high for a simple ketone or an amide but is in the typical range for an ester, specifically a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring). The conjugation lowers the frequency from a typical saturated ester (~1740 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester (-COO-R) group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet splitting (n+1=3) means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n=2), likely a methylene (-CH2-) group. This suggests an ethyl group fragment (-CH2-CH3).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet splitting (n+1=4) means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n=3), which must be the methyl group seen at 1.20 ppm.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significant downfield shift for a CH2 group. It is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **Combined evidence:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3) that is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and proton exchange. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** These are four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This clean \"doublet of doublets\" pattern is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent and are split by the two protons on the other side.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The presence of two distinct signals means the two substituents on the ring are different. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) is next to a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), while the upfield signal (7.0 ppm) is next to an electron-donating group (EDG).\n        *   The ester group (-COOEt) is an EWG.\n        *   The amino group (-NH2) is an EDG.\n        *   This confirms that the -NH2 and -COOEt groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  We have a benzene ring with two substituents at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  The structure is therefore ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly. It has a C9H11NO2 formula, a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer where the ester oxygen is attached to the ring. This would give a CH2 quartet at a much lower chemical shift (~2.5 ppm).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The IR C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹), and it would be a secondary amide (one N-H peak in IR). The NMR would show a formyl proton (H-C=O) singlet around 8.2 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester (wrong IR). It is also meta-substituted, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds to stretch.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an **ester** (usually 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for a typical amide (which would be ~1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, suggesting a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t):** It's a triplet, which means its neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This points to a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, suggesting a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q):** It's a quartet, which means its neighboring carbon has 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH2 group. It indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester: -O-CH2-CH3.\n*   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs):** A broad singlet is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an -OH or -NH group. Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the **-NH2** protons. The broadness is due to quadupole relaxation and/or chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are 4 protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d + d):** The presence of two doublets is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the chemically non-equivalent aromatic protons to split each other. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound contains:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nThese fragments can only be assembled in one way: the amine and the ethyl ester groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It has a secondary amide (not a primary amine) and an ether (not an ester). The IR and NMR would be significantly different.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is an amide (wrong C=O frequency) and is meta-substituted (would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the alkyl chain is attached to the carbonyl carbon (-OCOCH2CH3). The NMR for the CH2 group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Given the aromaticity suggested by the DBE, this value is consistent with a conjugated ester. A typical non-conjugated ester appears around 1735-1750 cm-1; conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency into this range.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H, which confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   The chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (causing the upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm for its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (causing the downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm for its ortho protons).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This pair of signals is the signature pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   The 1.20 ppm signal is a triplet (t) because the 3 protons of the methyl (CH3) group are coupled to the 2 protons of the adjacent methylene (CH2) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   The 4.5 ppm signal is a quartet (q) because the 2 protons of the methylene (CH2) group are coupled to the 3 protons of the adjacent methyl (CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester or ether. Combined with the C=O group from the IR, an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, is strongly indicated.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons is highly characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put all the identified pieces together:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPlacing these two groups in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   The electron-donating -NH2 group would shield its ortho protons, pushing them upfield (the signal at 7.0 ppm).\n*   The electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group would deshield its ortho protons, pushing them downfield (the signal at 8.0 ppm). This is a perfect match for the observed aromatic signals.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (wrong IR) and a formyl proton (not in NMR).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data: primary amine (IR, NMR), conjugated ester (IR), para-substituted ring with correct electronic effects (NMR), and an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (NMR). The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is a primary amide (amide C=O is ~1680 cm-1, not 1720 cm-1) and has meta substitution (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), so the CH2 quartet would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1.

IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. Its position is consistent with a carbonyl group that is conjugated with a benzene ring. This could be a conjugated ester or ketone. Given the molecular formula contains two oxygen atoms, an **ester (-COO-)** is very likely. An ester C=O conjugated to an aromatic ring typically appears around 1730-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH₂- group, following the n+1 rule where 2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a -CH₃- group, where 3+1=4).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are coupled and indicate the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the -CH₂- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an **ethoxy group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this confirms the **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H each):** There are two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet each):** This distinct pattern of two doublets is indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different (one electron-donating, one electron-withdrawing), creating this symmetrical pattern.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nWe have identified the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n*   A primary amine (-NH₂) group\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n\nPlacing these fragments together, the amine group and the ester group must be the two substituents on the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n*   **-COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl ester):** The -CH₃ gives the triplet at 1.20 ppm, and the -O-CH₂- gives the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This fits.\n*   **-NH₂ (amine):** The two amine protons give the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. This fits.\n*   **Para-substituted ring:** The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, and the amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group are shielded (appear upfield), corresponding to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOEt group are deshielded (appear downfield), corresponding to the doublet at 8.0 ppm. This arrangement fits the data perfectly.\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide, not an ester, and is meta-substituted. Incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our derived structure and all spectral data. Correct.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and ester. It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO). Incorrect.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester of phenol (-O-CO-R), not a benzoic acid ester (-CO-O-R). The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet for this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option that is consistent with all the provided data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). This suggests the compound contains a -NH2 group. A primary amide (-CONH2) also shows two bands, but a secondary amide (like in option D) would show only one.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency gives clues to the type of carbonyl group.\n        *   Standard alkyl esters (-COOR) are typically around 1750-1735 cm-1.\n        *   Amides (-CONH2) are typically lower, around 1690-1650 cm-1.\n        *   The value of 1720 cm-1 is slightly low for a simple ester, which suggests the ester group is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The presence of an electron-donating group on the ring (like -NH2) can further lower this frequency. This piece of data points towards a conjugated ester, such as an aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 hydrogens indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 hydrogens indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) signifies that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen.\n    *   Putting these two signals together (the triplet at 1.20 and the quartet at 4.5), we can confidently identify an **ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3)**. The chemical shift of the quartet is consistent with it being part of an ester (-COO-CH2-CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 hydrogens. This is consistent with the protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum. The protons on nitrogen are often broad due to chemical exchange and quadrupole coupling.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 hydrogens, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The protons near the electron-donating group are shielded (appear at a lower ppm, upfield), while the protons near the electron-withdrawing group are deshielded (appear at a higher ppm, downfield).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    From the fragments identified:\n    1.  A primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    3.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    Let's place these groups on the para-disubstituted ring. This gives us **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   The structure is H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3.\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group are expected to be upfield (around 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The aromatic protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group are expected to be downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n    *   This matches the NMR data perfectly. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. All spectral data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Other Options**\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is H2N-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CO-CH2- group around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. Also, the NMR would have a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) above 8 ppm, which is absent.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of all the spectral data, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only compound that fits all the evidence.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure of the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). Primary amines exhibit two bands due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an ester group, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a carbonyl group, most likely from an ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group) (3+1=4).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as oxygen.\n    *   **Combined Analysis (1.20 & 4.5 ppm):** The triplet-quartet pair is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms it is an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Shape (bs, broad singlet):** A broad singlet for 2H is highly characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). Broadening is common due to proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting (d, doublet & d, doublet):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and split the two protons ortho to the other substituent (and vice versa), resulting in two doublets.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are relatively upfield (shielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ester is formed on the phenyl ring's oxygen, which doesn't match the NMR.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine, not a primary one.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data and the molecular formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂).\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts both the IR and the NMR aromatic pattern.\n\nThe correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n    DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which fits with the IR data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (**-NH2**) group. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but is usually coupled with a lower frequency C=O stretch.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring. An amide C=O would typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1).\n    *   Combining these two points, the data suggests the presence of both a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This is a classic signature for a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen, as in an **ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (**-NH2**). The broadness is due to rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These are two doublets in the aromatic region of the spectrum, each integrating to 2 protons. This pattern is highly indicative of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   An amine group (-NH2) is electron-donating, which shields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a higher field/lower ppm).\n        *   An ester group (-COOR) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the aromatic protons (shifts them to a lower field/higher ppm).\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH2 group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the ester group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on all the evidence, we have:\n    1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n\n    Putting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group. Its NMR signal (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would be around 2.4 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and the broad 2H signal for -NH2 in the NMR.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This has a primary amide (-CONH2), which typically has a C=O stretch below 1700 cm-1. Also, the 1,3-(meta) substitution pattern would give a more complex set of signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring + three double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands arise from the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the range for an ester (typically 1735-1750 cm-1). Conjugation with the benzene ring (which we suspect from the DoU) would lower this frequency slightly, making 1720 cm-1 a very reasonable value for a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (a methyl group, -CH3). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a methylene group, -CH2-), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH2-**CH3**).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons (a methylene group, -CH2-). Its multiplicity is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a methyl group, -CH3-). The chemical shift is significantly downfield (deshielded), which indicates it's attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. This signal is the methylene part of an ethyl group that is attached to an oxygen, as in an ethyl ester (-O-**CH2**-CH3).\n    *   *Combining these two signals*, we can confidently identify an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons.

The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts are due to the electronic effects of the two different substituents. One substituent is electron-donating (the -NH2 group), which shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm). The other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, -COOEt), which deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.

This assembly gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer but would have a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet in the alkyl region), not an ethyl ester group.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR spectrum (would show one N-H stretch, not two). It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO) around 8 ppm, which is not observed.\n    *   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the DoU, the IR signals for -NH2 and a conjugated ester, and all the 1H NMR signals (para-substituted ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine protons).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double/triple bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none in this region.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl stretching region. This frequency is typical for an ester (R-CO-O-R'). Aldehydes and ketones are usually at a similar frequency, but amides are typically at a lower frequency (around 1650-1680 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, appearing as a triplet.

This corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-).\n    *   *Putting these two together:* The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly indicate the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is significantly downfield, which means the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen, as in an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). Given the high shift, an ester linkage is very likely.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two exchangeable protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns perfectly with the IR data. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shifts (7.0 ppm vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting the ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH2) is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOR) is a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This molecule has a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). All fragments identified from the spectra are present in this structure. The amino group (electron-donating) and ester group (electron-withdrawing) are para to each other, which would produce the observed two-doublet pattern in the aromatic region. This structure perfectly matches all data.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of the propionyl side (CH3CH2CO-). The -CH2- protons of the propionyl group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine (-NH2), which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and NMR (2H broad singlet) data.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This compound is a primary amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Furthermore, it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe data from the molecular formula, IR, and 1H NMR spectra all point unequivocally to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is highly suggestive of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet at a high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) means the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to 2 protons, confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH2) group seen in the IR spectrum. The broadening is common for amine protons due to exchange and quadrupolar relaxation.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have an **ester C=O** and an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)**. This combines to form an ethyl ester group, **-COOCH2CH3**.\n\nPutting these fragments together on a para-substituted benzene ring, the structure must be **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the data:\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2 (Correct)\n*   **IR:** Has an -NH2 group and a conjugated ester C=O. (Correct)\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   An ethoxy group gives a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and a quartet at ~4.5 ppm. (Correct)\n    *   A primary amine gives a broad 2H signal. (Correct, at 4.0 ppm)\n    *   A para-substituted ring with a donating group (-NH2) and a withdrawing group (-COOEt). The protons ortho to the donating -NH2 will be upfield (observed at 7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt will be downfield (observed at 8.0 ppm). (Correct)\n\n**5. Evaluating other options:**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta) and incorrect functional group (amide instead of ester).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect ester structure. The quartet for -C(=O)CH2- would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (shows a primary amine) and the NMR (shows a -NH2, not a -NH-).\n\nThe only candidate that perfectly matches all the provided spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) - 0 + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\nDoU = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is characteristic of an ester (R-COO-R'). It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) or a simple ketone conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t = triplet):** The triplet means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks), which is a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q = quartet):** The quartet means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks), which is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This confirms the -CH2-CH3 fragment (an ethyl group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield chemical shift for a -CH2- group. This indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom that is part of an ester group (-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Appearance (bs = broad singlet):** A broad signal that does not show clear splitting is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2).\n    *   Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The two sets of protons are chemically non-equivalent. The protons giving the signal at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (next to an electron-withdrawing group), and the protons giving the signal at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (next to an electron-donating group).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put the identified fragments together:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) - This is an electron-donating group.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) - The carbonyl part (-COO-) is an electron-withdrawing group.\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe two substituents, -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3, must be attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. The electron-donating -NH2 group will cause the adjacent aromatic protons to appear at a higher field (more shielded, ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group will cause its adjacent protons to appear at a lower field (deshielded, ~8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\nThe resulting structure is: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a CH2 group signal around 2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is a secondary amide (not primary), would have a different IR C=O stretch and N-H signal.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has meta-substitution which would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets. Also, it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm-1.\n\nTherefore, the data conclusively points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1\n*   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a C=O carbonyl group.\n\n### **2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is the hallmark of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively. This rules out secondary amides or amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, this value is characteristic of an ester (~1750-1715 cm⁻¹). It is generally too high for an amide (~1690-1650 cm⁻¹) or a ketone conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester group (-COO-).\n\n### **3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield, which means this CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl ester group: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂** group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two groups on the ring cause the four aromatic protons to split into two chemically distinct pairs. One group is electron-donating (the -NH₂ group), and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, -COOR). The electron-donating group shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing group deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data, we have the following structural fragments:\n1.  An ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n3.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n4.  A carbonyl group as part of the ester.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives only one possible structure: a benzene ring with an amino group and an ethyl carboxylate group at positions 1 and 4. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options provided:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. It has a primary amine, an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- quartet would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H stretches in the IR spectrum. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets. Also, an amide C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency than 1720 cm⁻¹. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only compound that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group, C=O, which accounts for 1 DoU).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp peaks is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated ester. An amide carbonyl would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1). This suggests the presence of a -C(=O)O- group attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This corresponds to the -CH2- part of the -CH2-CH3 fragment identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH2- group, which indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group (-COOCH2-). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals in this region are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those of an amine (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) group. Given the IR data, this confirms the primary amine (-NH2).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting (d, d):** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly deshielded, indicating they are ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded, indicating they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the primary amine, -NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2) attached to the ring.\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the ring.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound with an amide. It would not give the para-substituted NMR pattern and the IR for the C=O group is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester. It perfectly matches all the data: formula C9H11NO2, IR signals for -NH2 and conjugated ester, and the NMR signals for an ethyl group, a para-disubstituted ring, and a primary amine.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR showing two N-H bands.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this structure, the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl (CH3CH2-C=O), not the ester oxygen. The -CH2- protons would be around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   We first calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get clues about rings and double bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of ~1720 cm-1 is characteristic of an **ester**, particularly an aryl ester (an ester group attached to a benzene ring). It is too high for a simple amide and too low for a phenyl ester where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a triplet integrating to 3 protons. This indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a quartet integrating to 2 protons. This indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) means the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester linkage (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This signal, in combination with the IR data, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH2)** protons. The signal is broad due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts mean the two substituents on the ring are electronically different. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho (adjacent) to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n    1.  We have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n    4.  Combining these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Checking the Alternatives**\n    *   A) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: Matches all data.\n    *   B) **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: Is a secondary amide (not primary amine) and has an ether linkage. Would not match IR or NMR.\n    *   C) **4-aminophenyl propionate**: The ester is H2N-Ph-O-CO-CH2CH3. The NMR signal for the -CH2- group next to the C=O would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) **3-ethoxybenzamide**: Is meta-substituted (not para), so the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex. Also, it's a primary amide, and the IR C=O stretch is typically lower than 1720 cm-1.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\n        DoU = 9 + 1 - 11/2 - 0/2 + 1/2\n        DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    2.  A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    1.  **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n    2.  **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms and the chemical formula, this is likely an **ester** group (-COOR). The frequency is a bit high for a simple alkyl ester but is characteristic of an aryl ester or an ester conjugated with a double bond (like the benzene ring), which is consistent with our DoU calculation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    1.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n        *   The chemical shifts (7.0-8.0 ppm) indicate protons on an aromatic ring.\n        *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   The large difference in chemical shifts between the two doublets suggests the two substituents have opposite electronic effects: one is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing. The electron-donating group shields the *ortho* protons (lower ppm, ~7.0), while the electron-withdrawing group deshields its *ortho* protons (higher ppm, ~8.0).\n    2.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n        *   This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) at 1.20 ppm is a triplet because it's adjacent to the two protons of the -CH2- group (n+1 = 2+1=3).\n        *   The methylene group (-CH2-) at 4.5 ppm is a quartet because it's adjacent to the three protons of the -CH3 group (n+1 = 3+1=4).\n        *   The significant downfield shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this case is the oxygen of the ester: **-O-CH2-CH3**.\n    3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n        *   The integration (2H) and the broadness of the signal (bs = broad singlet) are consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH2)** group identified from the IR spectrum. The broadening is due to quadropolar relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and/or chemical exchange. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amino group attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group. The protons *ortho* to this group should be the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group. The protons *ortho* to this group should be the downfield aromatic doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n    The structure is therefore 4-aminobenzoic acid, ethyl ester, which is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    Structure:\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n      - C - O - CH2 - CH3\n      |\n     / \\\n    |   |\n    |   |\n     \\ /\n      |\n      NH2\n    ```\n    This structure matches the molecular formula (C9H11NO2), the IR data (-NH2 and ester C=O), and all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: An amide, not an ester.

The remaining DBE of 1 suggests an additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester (an ester group attached to an aromatic ring).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) with three protons. The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), most likely a methylene (-CH2-) group. This suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-) with two protons. The quartet (q) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a group with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), confirming it is coupled to the methyl group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which is characteristic of an oxygen in an ester (R-COO-CH2-). Thus, we have an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet represents two exchangeable protons, which is consistent with the primary amine (-NH2) group identified from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The large difference in chemical shift between the two doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**, which is an electron-donating group.\n    3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n    The structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group appear upfield (7.0 ppm).\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n    *   This structure matches the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n    *   This structure is consistent with all spectral data.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group would be part of a propionate (-OCOCH2CH3), and its -CH2- signal would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure is a perfect match for all the data.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR would show a single N-H band and an amide carbonyl stretch at a lower frequency (~1680 cm-1).\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional double bond (like C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)** group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for an **ester C=O group**, especially when it is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from the typical 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ range.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, typical of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) implies it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal, along with the next one, suggests an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two equivalent protons, typical of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) implies it is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is highly deshielded. A chemical shift greater than 4.0 ppm for a CH₂ group is characteristic of it being bonded to an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-**CH₂**-R').\n    *   **Conclusion:** The signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are very common for protons attached to nitrogen (or oxygen) due to hydrogen bonding and rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.0 ppm):** This shift is consistent with an **amino group (-NH₂)** attached directly to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the -NH₂ group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Suggests four protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** In a 1,4-disubstituted ring, one substituent is electron-donating, and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n        *   The amino group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, shielding the adjacent protons and shifting them upfield (to a lower ppm value). The signal at **7.0 ppm** is therefore assigned to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group.\n        *   The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, deshielding the adjacent protons and shifting them downfield (to a higher ppm value). The signal at **8.0 ppm** is therefore assigned to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An ethyl ester group: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring to which these two groups are attached.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure has all the required features: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring. It is a perfect match for all spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. It would have a -CO-CH₂-CH₃ group. The -CH₂- group would appear as a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an amine. The IR would show a single N-H stretch, and the carbonyl would be at a lower frequency (~1670 cm⁻¹). It would also have only one NH proton in the NMR. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide and is 1,3- (meta) substituted. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern (not two doublets), and the IR would show amide signals. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound that fits all the provided spectral data (molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR) is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
