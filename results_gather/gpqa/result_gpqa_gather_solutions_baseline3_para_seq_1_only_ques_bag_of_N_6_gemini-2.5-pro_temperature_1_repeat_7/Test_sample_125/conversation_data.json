This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the attack on the two faces is not equally probable, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH4 is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH4) are both achiral, the reaction must produce an overall achiral mixture. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. Since the reaction is not stereospecific, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is a meso compound and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Combined Products:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a **separate peak**. This gives two peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C9H20O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase can differentiate between chiral molecules, including enantiomers, because they interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other. The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, into **two separate peaks**. The meso compound is achiral, but it is a diastereomer of the other two and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, eluting as its own **separate peak**. This gives three peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   Again, the products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The stereocenter is at carbon C5, which is bonded to -H, -CH₃, -OCH₃, and -CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The problem states the configuration at C5 is (S). This is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so its configuration remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either the front face or the back face of this planar group.\n    *   This attack creates two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   Because the starting material is chiral (has a stereocenter at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack will not be a 50:50 mixture, but it will produce both possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The overall mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central CH₂ group. It is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The products are:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and **can be separated**.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular structures (constitutional isomers or simply different molecules) have different properties and **can be separated**.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will be separated from them. → **1 peak**.\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will co-elute. → **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will be easily separated from them.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can form transient diastereomeric complexes with chiral molecules, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   It separates structurally different compounds.\n    *   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically and stereochemically distinct.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 4: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 5: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let's break down the name to understand the structure. \"hexan-3-one\" indicates a six-carbon chain with a ketone group at carbon 3. \"5-methoxy\" means a -OCH3 group is attached to carbon 5. \"(S)\" specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is carbon 5 (it's bonded to H, CH3, OCH3, and a larger alkyl ketone group).\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). The acidic workup is to protonate the resulting alkoxide ion.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the C3 ketone. The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. The reduction of the planar sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbon at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** This reaction produces two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I yields a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical molecule with two ketone groups. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the alkoxides.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers have an internal plane of symmetry, making them an achiral **meso compound**. They are the same molecule.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction will produce an optically inactive mixture. This means the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture), along with the meso compound. Therefore, Reaction II yields **three stereoisomeric products**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separability:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable on an achiral column. This gives **1 peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are also structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be well separated. The total number of peaks is the sum of the separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from meso of Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The interactions between each enantiomer and the chiral stationary phase are diastereomeric in nature, resulting in different retention times.\n*   **Separability:** Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined product mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column is designed to resolve them all. Therefore, we would expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means two diastereomeric products will be formed, generally in unequal amounts.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). Because the reactant and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the groups attached to C2 and C4 are identical), there are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Normal-Phase HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment:\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n\nThe combined mixture contains five compounds in total: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers, however, will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I are methoxy-alcohols, while the products from Reaction II are diols. These two classes of compounds have significantly different structures and polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks on a normal-phase column will be the sum of the peaks from each group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The column creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n\nThe mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nSince all five of these compounds are stereochemically different from one another, a chiral column is expected to resolve all of them.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the others (as it's a diastereomer to them).\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be resolved from each other.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution, each of the five stereoisomers will produce a separate peak. This results in a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. The chemical formula is C7H14O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and it is given as the pure (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride): This is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S), as the hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Since these two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a beta-diketone. The chemical formula is C5H8O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride): This is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxides to form the final diol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Starting from an achiral molecule with an achiral reagent, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n        *   Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product E: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Products C and D are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product E, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Product E: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nWe need to determine how many peaks are observed on two different types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase (achiral) column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   Products A and B are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   Products C and D are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n*   Product E is a diastereomer of C and D. It will separate from the C/D pair, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (A and B) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C, D, and E), so they will all be well-separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from A and B) + 1 (from C+D) + 1 (from E) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, **and** enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture will be separated from all the others, assuming the column has adequate resolving power.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n*   Product A will be separated.\n*   Product B will be separated.\n*   Product C will be separated.\n*   Product D will be separated (from its enantiomer, C).\n*   Product E will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). It is a chiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The starting material is chiral ((S) at C5). The reduction of the carbonyl at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter (R or S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the starting material is chiral, the transition states leading to the two products are diastereomeric, meaning the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts (diastereoselective reaction), but both will be present in the product mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no stereocenters.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols. The acidic workup provides the protons.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2ⁿ = 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S): These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S): This stereoisomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry (when drawn in the correct conformation). A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC (an achiral technique) separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since they are diastereomers, they have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute as a single peak. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    3.  **Overall:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. There is no risk of accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each stereoisomer, leading to different retention times.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all such stereoisomers. Each of these five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will therefore be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Total = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5 with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the products:** The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces (re and si faces). Since the existing chiral center at C5 is relatively far from the reacting C3 carbonyl, there is no significant steric influence to favor one side of attack over the other. Therefore, both possible configurations at C3, (R) and (S), will be formed in roughly equal amounts.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the two carbonyls creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups can lead to different combinations of stereoconfigurations at C2 and C4.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between the stereoisomers:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom and is therefore a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   (2S, 4R) is the mirror image of (2R, 4S), but because the molecule is meso, it is superimposable on (2R, 4S). Thus, they are the same compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)- or (2S, 4R)-)\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers. So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (except for interaction with chiral entities) and therefore cannot be separated on an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (and structurally different molecules in general) have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different properties, and will give a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ mono-alcohols with an ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with peaks from Reaction II.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   Chiral columns can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   A chiral column will resolve all five of them.\n    1.  Peak for (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  Peak for (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  Peak for (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  Peak for (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  Peak for meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   C5 is the chiral center.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can occur from two different faces of the planar carbonyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Since there is already a chiral center at C5, the two possible outcomes of the attack on C3 will result in the formation of two diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** This molecule has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric. Let's check for a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2R, 4S) form has such a plane of symmetry (and is identical to the (2S, 4R) form). Therefore, it is a single, achiral meso compound.\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, there is no preference for the formation of one enantiomer over the other. They will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Products and Analyze by HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It is an achiral technique.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the chiral pentane-2,4-diols. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, appearing as its own peak.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5H12O2). They are structurally different and will have different polarities, so they will be separated from the products of Reaction II.\n\nCounting the peaks for normal-phase HPLC:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 3: The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (elute together)\n*   Peak 4: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n**Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which leads to different retention times.\n*   Therefore, a chiral HPLC column can separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n\nCounting the peaks for chiral HPLC:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of peak 1)\n*   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of peak 3)\n*   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of peaks 3 & 4)\n**Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5**\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a six-carbon chain.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at position C3.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position C5.\n    *   There is a single stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is (S). This stereocenter will not be altered during the reaction.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. The stereocenter is the carbon with the methoxy group.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter at this position.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The reaction creates a mixture of two products. Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the two products are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers**. They have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements at one (but not all) stereocenters. Diastereomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone with a five-carbon chain.\n    *   The carbonyl groups are at positions C2 and C4.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry and no stereocenters.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   With two stereocenters, there is a maximum of 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers. We need to examine their relationships.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral)\n    *   The two enantiomers are formed as a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. It can, however, separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   **Total Compounds:** We have a mixture of 5 compounds in total (2 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II).\n    *   **From Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and have different polarities. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it has a different polarity and will be separated from them, giving a second peak.\n        *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   **Overall:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = (Peaks from I) + (Peaks from II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. In essence, it can separate all stereochemically unique molecules.\n*   **Total Compounds:** We have 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    1.

Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's determine the structure and identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates a 6-carbon chain (hexane). A ketone group is at position 3, and a methoxy group is at position 5.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n    *   The problem states there is a stereocenter at position 5 with (S) configuration. This center is not involved in the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The C3 carbon is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can occur from two different faces of the planar carbonyl group. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can be either (R) or (S). The original stereocenter at C5 remains (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. The configuration is the same at C5 but different at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers are distinct compounds with different physical properties. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" means both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric around the central CH₂ group (C3). The substituents on C2 and C4 are identical (H, OH, CH₃, and the rest of the molecule).\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a **pair of enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) and is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) form. Therefore, (2R, 4S) is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Products:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n*   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. (Two diastereomers)\n*   From Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol. (A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound, which is a diastereomer of the enantiomers).\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers**, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I are **diastereomers**. They have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak for the meso compound**.\n    3.  The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated from each other and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak for the enantiomeric pair**.\n    4.  The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They are constitutional isomers (if they had the same formula) or, in this case, simply completely different molecules with different structures, formulas, and polarities. They will certainly be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = (Peak for product 1 from Rxn I) + (Peak for product 2 from Rxn I) + (Peak for meso compound from Rxn II) + (Peak for enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, every stereoisomerically distinct compound in the mixture can be separated from the others (assuming an effective column).\n*   Let's count the distinct compounds:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This stereocenter will not be affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. Since there is already a stereocenter at C5, the two faces are diastereotopic. This means the attack from the two sides will lead to the formation of two different products, which are diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Reaction I produces a mixture of two compounds that are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃(C=O)CH₂(C=O)CH₃.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The product molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the resulting mixture of stereoisomers must be optically inactive overall. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction produces them in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The molecule has equivalent stereocenters (C2 and C4). Therefore, the (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound (it is superimposable on the (2R, 4S) isomer).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Reaction II produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), but it cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated, producing a **second peak**.\n    *   So, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column.\n*   **Combined Analysis:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular weights, polarities, and structures. Therefore, it is expected that all separable groups will have unique retention times (no accidental co-elution).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, as they will interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of these unique stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers), and assuming no accidental overlap between the structurally different molecules from the two reactions, each compound will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is the carbon with the methoxy group.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the original stereocenter at C5, so it remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This non-selective attack creates both possible configurations at C3, i.e., (R) and (S).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (because one center is the same (S) while the other is different (R vs. S)). They are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetric diketone: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these possibilities:\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**.\n        *   **(2S, 4R):** This is identical to the (2R, 4S) meso compound (you can confirm this by rotating the molecule).\n    *   Therefore, three stereoisomers are formed:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of the above)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined products with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It is an **achiral** technique.\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **cannot** be separated (they co-elute as a single peak).\n*   The combined mixture contains 5 total compounds from the two reactions.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different properties, they will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different retention time. The two enantiomers will co-elute. This results in **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair of enantiomers).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally very different molecules. It is extremely unlikely that any product from Reaction I would co-elute with a product from Reaction II.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC** = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined products with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can separate molecules that differ in their three-dimensional structure.\n*   **Key principle:** Chiral HPLC can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column can distinguish between all of these. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be separated. The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer to all the other chiral products and will also have a unique retention time.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 compounds will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC** = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and it is provided as a pure enantiomer (S).\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The starting material already has a stereocenter at C5 ((S)-configuration). The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 can result in either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new stereocenter. This leads to the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Because the reaction occurs under the influence of an existing chiral center, these two diastereomers will be formed in unequal amounts (this is known as asymmetric induction). However, for the purpose of counting peaks, we know that two distinct compounds are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3) and is an achiral **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, the reaction cannot favor one enantiomer over the other. Therefore, the chiral products, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be formed in equal amounts, creating a **racemic mixture**. The meso compound will also be formed.\n*   So, Reaction II produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: the racemic pair of enantiomers and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions:\n*   From Rxn I: Two diastereomers ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol).\n*   From Rxn II: Three stereoisomers ((2R, 4R)-, (2S, 4S)-, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\nThe products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, no product from Reaction I will co-elute (have the same retention time) with any product from Reaction II on any HPLC column. We can simply add the number of peaks from each reaction's products.\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity).\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn I:** The two diastereomers will have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different polarity, thus eluting as a separate peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)). The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new chiral center (R or S). Since there is already a chiral center in the molecule, the two products formed will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketones react. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (they are superimposable). So, there is only one meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The mixture contains the five stereoisomers produced in both reactions.\n    *   Products from Rxn I: (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Products from Rxn II: The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different (different molecular weight, functional groups, and polarity). It is certain they will not co-elute (i.e., elute at the same time).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.

(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all five distinct stereoisomers, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. This is followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. Therefore, two products are formed:\n    *   Product 1 (P1): (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2 (P2): (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** P1 and P2 have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The problem states \"excess\" NaBH4, ensuring both ketone groups are reduced. This is followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. We need to determine the possible stereoisomers. The molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C4) and is symmetric.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (P3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (P4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is a **meso compound** (P5) due to an internal plane of symmetry. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship and Mixture Composition:** Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, the product mixture must be optically inactive. This means that the chiral products, P3 and P4, must be formed in equal amounts as a **racemic mixture**. The meso compound, P5, is also formed. Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers (P3 and P4) and a meso compound (P5). P5 is a diastereomer of P3 and P4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will give **two separate peaks**.\n    *   P3 and P4 are enantiomers, so they have the same polarity and will co-elute, giving **one single peak**.\n    *   P5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of P3 and P4. Therefore, it has a different polarity and will give a **separate peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They will have significantly different polarities and retention times, so there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Counting the peaks:** We have four groups of compounds that are separable on a normal-phase column: {P1}, {P2}, {P3+P4}, and {P5}.\n*   **Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** There will be a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities. Chiral HPLC can, of course, also separate diastereomers. In short, it can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}. These are five distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1 ((3R, 5S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P2 ((3S, 5S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P3 ((2R, 4R)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P4 ((2S, 4S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak (separated from its enantiomer P3)\n    *   P5 (meso-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak (separated from all others as it is a diastereomer)\n*   **Counting the peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** There will be a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in two separate reactions and then determining how these products will be separated using two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   There is a pre-existing stereocenter at C-5 with the (S) configuration. This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C-3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule already contains a stereocenter at C-5, these two faces are diastereotopic. The attack from one face will lead to the (3S) alcohol, and the attack from the other face will lead to the (3R) alcohol. The stereocenter at C-5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n    The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, this pair of chiral products will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a meso compound. It is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) and is achiral.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The first two are produced as a single racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It operates in an achiral environment.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's analyze the combined product mixture:\n*   **From Reaction I:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The racemic mixture of [(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The racemic pair and the meso compound are diastereomers and will be separated. The two enantiomers within the racemic mixture will elute together. This gives **two distinct peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   We have a total of five distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from Reaction II.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, will also be separated.\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically unique (or achiral but diastereomeric to the chiral molecules), they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Assuming an ideal separation with no accidental co-elution, each compound will produce its own peak.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at carbon C3. This carbon is prochiral, meaning a reaction at this site can create a new chiral center.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone C=O group to a secondary alcohol C-OH group.\n    *   The reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule is already chiral (due to the (S) center at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally probable, leading to an unequal mixture of two diastereomeric products.\n    *   The configuration at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction. The new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same ((S) at C5) and the other being different ((R) vs (S) at C3).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no chiral centers. It has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (an equal amount of each enantiomer).\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of enantiomers. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it's superimposable on its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a meso compound, which is achiral.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n        1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        2.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate structurally different compounds and diastereomers. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment.\n*   **The combined mixture contains:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarity and will co-elute (not separate). This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso form) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will be separate from the peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peak for Cpd 1) + (Peak for Cpd 2) + (Peak for Cpds 3 & 4) + (Peak for Cpd 5) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.

(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column is designed to separate such isomers, we expect each compound to produce a separate peak (assuming ideal separation conditions).\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OCH(CH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates the stereocenter is at C5, and its configuration is (S).

The attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) can occur from either the Re face or the Si face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.

Since they are formed from a chiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** We obtain **2 distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and does not have any stereocenters.

The stationary phase is polar (e.g., silica).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **can be separated** and will give distinct peaks.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers.

It will have a different polarity and produce a separate peak (**1 peak**).\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II will give a total of 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (one -OH, one ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (two -OH groups) and will have significantly different polarities. Thus, it's safe to assume their peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Since we have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our final mixture, and chiral HPLC can resolve them all, we expect to see one peak for each compound.\n    1.

(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (It will have a diastereomeric interaction with the CSP relative to the chiral isomers, so it will also be separated).\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a single stereocenter at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-O-C*H(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, where C* is the chiral center.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products which are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed. Let's call them Product A and Product B.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure of the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and is therefore a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (they are superimposable).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Let's call this Product C)\n    *   A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product D) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   **Product A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product C:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product D:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product E:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each HPLC experiment.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and therefore cannot be separated. They co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   Products A and B are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Product C (meso) is a diastereomer of products D and E. Therefore, C will be separated from the D/E pair.\n    *   Products D and E are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   So, the products from Reaction II will give **two peaks** in total on a normal-phase column (one for C, one for the D+E pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nA chiral stationary phase allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers (A, B, C, D, E).\n*   Product A and Product B are diastereomers and will be resolved. (2 peaks)\n*   Product C is an achiral meso compound and will appear as a single peak.\n*   Product D and Product E are enantiomers, and the chiral column is designed to separate them. They will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   All five compounds (A, B, C, D, E) are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in different retention times.\n*   Therefore, all five stereoisomers will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The main chain is a hexane with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. The numbering starts from the end closer to the ketone.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces (re or si face).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (its configuration is still S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric alcohol products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry through the central CH2 group).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The use of \"excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between products:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), making it an achiral molecule. This is a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a separate, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The compounds from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the compounds from Reaction II (C5 diols). Their polarities will be different, so there will be no accidental overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate both **diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a separate peak (assuming the column is effective and there's no accidental co-elution, which is the standard assumption for such problems).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We count the number of unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   This gives a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    Let's draw the structure. It's a 6-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at C5. The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n    ```\n          O\n          ||\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3\n    1   2  3  4   5        6\n    ```\n    The molecule has one chiral center at C5, with the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is prochiral (a planar sp2 carbon). The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Attack from one face gives the (3R) alcohol.\n    *   Attack from the other face gives the (3S) alcohol.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Since the C5 configuration remains (S), two products are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two chiral centers. They have the same configuration at one center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Note that because the starting material is chiral, these two diastereomers will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    ```\n          O       O\n          ||      ||\n    CH3 - C - CH2 - C - CH3\n    1   2   3   4   5\n    ```\n    This molecule is achiral and has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n    NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The two new chiral centers at C2 and C4 can have either (R) or (S) configurations. The possible combinations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's check for internal symmetry. The molecule is symmetrical around the central CH2 group. If we consider the (2R, 4S) structure, it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) structure is identical to the (2R, 4S) structure (it can be superimposed by rotation).\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Chiral)\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Chiral, enantiomer of the above)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Achiral)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined into a single sample. This sample contains a total of **five** distinct chemical compounds (two diastereomers from Reaction I, and one pair of enantiomers + one meso compound from Reaction II).\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It is an **achiral** technique.\n*   Achiral techniques **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and will therefore have the same retention time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Achiral techniques **can** separate diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will have different retention times.\n*   Let's identify the separable species in the mixture:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol:** A distinct compound.\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol:** The diastereomer of compound 1. It will be separated.\n    3.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** A distinct achiral compound.\n    4.  **The racemic mixture of (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are enantiomers and will elute together as a single peak. This enantiomeric pair and the meso-diol are diastereomers of each other, so they will be separated.\n*   Furthermore, the products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities. Thus, all four of these groups should be separable.\n*   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can distinguish between stereoisomers that have different 3D shapes.\n*   It **can** separate enantiomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers.\n*   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical. Our mixture contains five non-identical stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   All five of these compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position, and its configuration is given as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The ketone group is at C3.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The carbon of the ketone (C3) is prochiral. Its reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the hydride attack can occur from two different faces of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of two products. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they form an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (1:1 ratio).\n    *   (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same molecule. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the C3-CH₂ group) and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and one racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated on a normal-phase (achiral) column. They will elute together, giving a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on a normal-phase column.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** have different structures and are also separable.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((3) and (4)) and a meso compound ((5)). The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will have a different retention time and give a separate peak, which is **1 peak**. In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂, alcohol-ethers) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂, diols). They have significantly different structures and polarities. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that any product from Reaction I would co-elute with a product from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral HPLC column can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   Our mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers (listed in Step 3).\n*   A chiral column will resolve all of them:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (different from Peak 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.

The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   The stereocenter at C-5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains (S).\n    *   Therefore, the products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The two products have the configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). Since they have two stereocenters, and the configuration is the same at one center (C-5) but different at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   The reaction starts with a chiral compound, so the two diastereomers are generally formed in unequal amounts, but since the reaction goes to 100% completion, both will be present in the final mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketones are reduced.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reduction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   With two stereocenters, there are up to 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, this enantiomeric pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts of each).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has chiral centers but is an achiral molecule overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound, just viewed differently.\n        *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The final mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine the number of peaks observed on each type of HPLC column.\n\n**A) Normal-phase HPLC (achiral stationary phase):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus different polarities. They **can be separated**.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S)) are diastereomers. They will be separated from each other. The two enantiomers, however, will elute together. This results in **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (chiral stationary phase):**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture can be resolved into a separate peak (assuming a suitable chiral column is used, which is the standard assumption in such problems).\n*   Let's count the peaks from the 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomer)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separated from its enantiomer)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomers)\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final analysis shows that there will be **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with the formula CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It possesses one chiral center at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration. Since the problem specifies the configuration, we are starting with an enantiomerically pure compound.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide ion to form the alcohol.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** The carbonyl group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by this reaction.\n    *   Since the attack happens at a prochiral center in a molecule that is already chiral, the two transition states are diastereomeric. This leads to the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other. They are typically not formed in a 1:1 ratio, but two distinct products are formed.\n\n4.  **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other, hence they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone with the formula CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has no stereocenters and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" implies that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** Both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Products:**\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbon. Therefore, it is an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image is (2S, 4R), which is identical to (2R, 4S).\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatography Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus **will be separated**. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II are one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. It will be separated from them, giving **1 peak**.\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the racemic pair.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers. They have different molecular weights, structures, and polarities, so they will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The chiral column will separate all five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, assuming the column is appropriate for these compounds.\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of Peak 1)\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomer of Peak 3)\n        *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, achiral and diastereomer of Peaks 3 & 4)\n*   **Total Peaks:** The chiral column can resolve all five unique stereoisomers. This gives a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis question asks for the number of peaks observed in two different types of HPLC experiments (normal-phase and chiral) for a mixture of reaction products. To answer this, we need to determine the products of each reaction and then analyze how they would be separated by each chromatographic technique.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, as indicated by the (S) designation for the stereocenter at carbon 5. The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, meaning the hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face (top or bottom).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** Since the original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, it remains in the (S) configuration. The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Products A and B have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃). This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent, and \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃). The reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. We must consider the configurations at C2 and C4.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is identical to (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers** and are formed as a 1:1 mixture, known as a racemic mixture. Let's call these Product C and Product D.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. Let's call this Product E.\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a total of **three stereoisomers**: one racemic pair (C and D) and one meso compound (E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the separation of the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products A and B:** They are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products C and D:** They are enantiomers. They have identical polarities and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the pair.\n    3.  **Product E:** This is a meso compound. It is a diastereomer of C and D. It has different physical properties and polarity and will be separated from the peak containing C and D. This gives **1 peak**.\n    4.  **Products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II:** The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) are structurally very different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂). They will have different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** We have four separable groups: A, B, (C+D), and E. Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers (A, B, C, D, E). A chiral column is designed to resolve such a mixture.\n    1.  **Product A:** ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) -> **1 peak**\n    2.  **Product B:** ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) -> **1 peak** (separated from A)\n    3.  **Product C:** ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak**\n    4.  **Product D:** ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak** (separated from its enantiomer, C)\n    5.  **Product E:** (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomers, C and D)\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers will be resolved. Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a six-carbon chain.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face (re or si face) of the carbonyl plane.\n    *   This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral and the reagent (LAH) is achiral, the attack is not stereospecific. It will lead to the formation of both possible configurations at C3, which are (R) and (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The products are stereoisomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Since the configuration at C5 is fixed as (S) and the new center at C3 can be (R) or (S), two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same and the other being opposite.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   New chiral centers are created at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   We need to consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers are identical and represent a single achiral compound called a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers) if the product is chiral. It will also produce any possible meso compounds.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol [(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol]\n        2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        (where the latter two form a racemic mixture).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:**\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1)\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2)\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer +)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer -)\n\n**Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like the pair from Reaction II) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like the pair from Reaction I) have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC, showing up as distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different polarities. Thus, they will be separated from the diols.\n*   Let's count the number of species that can be separated:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of 1, so it separates)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomers co-elute; this species is a diastereomer of Peak 3, so it separates)\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between these four chemically distinct species, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers.\n*   It will resolve all stereoisomers in the mixture that have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Let's count the number of distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3, achiral compound, gives one peak)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, enantiomer of 4, separates on chiral column)\n*   All five of these stereoisomers are chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule. The structure is:\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH-CH3\n                     |\n                     OCH3\n    ```\n    The stereocenter is at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S). The molecule is chiral.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. Since the starting material is chiral (due to the stereocenter at C5), the transition states leading to the two possible configurations at C3 are diastereomeric. This means the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts. However, regardless of the ratio, two distinct products will be formed.\n\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged: (S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** and **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**.\n\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products have two stereocenters. One center has the same configuration (S), while the other is different (R vs. S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images are called **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    ```\n        O      O\n        ||     ||\n    CH3-C -CH2- C-CH3\n    ```\n    This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The \"excess\" reagent ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reduction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    ```\n        OH     OH\n        |      |\n    CH3-CH -CH2- CH-CH3\n    ```\n    We need to determine the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (which is identical to (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n*   **Relationship between Products:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)) will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the pair. This gives **1 peak** for the meso compound.\n*   The enantiomers from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate on an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the enantiomeric pair.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutionally different molecules, so they will certainly have different retention times.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It **can** separate all different stereoisomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The chiral column will separate every unique stereoisomer present in the mixture. Since we have identified 5 distinct stereoisomeric products, and assuming no accidental co-elution (which is a standard assumption in such problems), we will see one peak for each.\n1.  Peak for (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Peak for (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Peak for (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n4.  Peak for (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Peak for (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The existing stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This leads to the formation of two products:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the attack of the hydride is generally not stereospecific without a directing group, both diastereomers will be formed.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to secondary alcohols. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers for a molecule with two stereocenters (C2 and C4).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, these will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), which makes it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (just flipping the molecule upside down).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (like the products from Reaction I and Reaction II, which have different molecular formulas C7H16O2 vs C5H12O2).\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II's products, the meso compound (3) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((4) and (5)). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. This gives **1 peak** for the meso compound.\n*   The enantiomers from Reaction II ((4) and (5)) cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the racemic pair.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally very different, all these peaks will be distinct.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso diol) + 1 (racemic diol) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Assuming an effective chiral column, it should be able to resolve all structurally different molecules.\n*   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers ((1), (2), (3), (4), and (5)).\n*   A chiral column will separate the diastereomers ((1) vs (2); and (3) vs (4)/(5)).\n*   Crucially, a chiral column will also separate the enantiomeric pair ((4) vs (5)).\n*   Therefore, each of the five compounds in the mixture will produce a separate peak.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. Let's identify the chiral center. The name indicates the stereochemistry at carbon 5 is (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol group (CH-OH).\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction.\n    *   The ketone at C3 is prochiral. The incoming hydride ion can attack from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements at one (but not all) stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is symmetric and achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction is expected to produce them in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. It is a **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Separation on Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute, appearing as a single peak).\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) + (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers, so it will elute at a different time, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   Total from Reaction II is 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** We need to consider if peaks from Reaction I products might accidentally overlap with peaks from Reaction II products.\n    *   Reaction I products: C₇H₁₆O₂ (ether-alcohols)\n    *   Reaction II products: C₅H₁₂O₂ (diols)\n    *   The compounds have different molecular formulas, molecular weights, and functionalities (one ether and one alcohol vs. two alcohols). Their polarities will be significantly different. It is a standard and safe assumption in such problems that they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Separation on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Key principle:** A chiral column can distinguish between all unique stereoisomers (both enantiomers and diastereomers), assuming the column is suitable for the compounds.\n*   We simply need to count the total number of unique stereoisomeric products formed.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have 2 unique diastereomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have 3 unique stereoisomers (the two enantiomers and the meso compound). A chiral column will resolve the enantiomers from each other, and both from the meso compound. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** Again, we assume no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon C-5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n    *   The ketone at C-3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C-3.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter C-3: (R) or (S).\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C-5 remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have two stereocenters. The configuration is the same at one center (C-5) but different at the other (C-3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This is a symmetric and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product molecule has two stereocenters, at C-2 and C-4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n        *   Consider (2R, 4S). Due to the symmetry of the molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. This is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (you can see this by flipping the molecule over).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound ((2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the mixture on a normal-phase HPLC column\n\n*   **Total Compounds:** The final mixture contains the 5 stereoisomers produced in both reactions.\n*   **Separation Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they elute together and show a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving another **one peak**.\n    4.  The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They have different molecular weights, functional groups, and polarities, so they will not co-elute with each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks** in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the mixture on a chiral HPLC column\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). A CSP can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing them to be separated. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** A chiral column has the ability to resolve all stereochemically distinct compounds. Our mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically different, a chiral HPLC system can, in principle, separate all of them.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will now be resolved into two separate peaks (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is diastereomeric to the others and will be resolved as its own peak (**1 peak**).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks observed will be 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: The parent chain is hexane. There's a ketone (C=O) at position 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`. The chiral center at C5 is marked (S).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The ketone at carbon 3 is prochiral. Its reduction to an alcohol will create a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible stereoisomers for the new alcohol group at C3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`. This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric around C3. This means that (2R, 4S) is the same molecule as (2S, 4R). This specific stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) stereoisomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, any chiral products must be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. We have a total of 5 stereoisomers in the mixture:\n*   **From Rxn I:**\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **From Rxn II:**\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but **it cannot separate enantiomers**.\n*   **Separating Rxn I products:** Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Separating Rxn II products:**\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Combining the results:** The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols). They have different molecular formulas, sizes, and polarities, and will thus be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   The goal of chiral chromatography is to resolve all stereoisomers. We assume the column and conditions are suitable for this task.\n*   We have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   A chiral HPLC column can distinguish between all of these. Enantiomers (3 and 4) will be separated. Diastereomers (e.g., 1 vs 2, or 3 vs 5) will be separated. Constitutional isomers (the hexanols vs the diols) will be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Thus, we expect **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol. LAH is a strong, non-selective reducing agent.\n*   **Product:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to an alcohol (-OH group). The reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The starting material has one chiral center (C5). The reaction creates a new one (C3). The starting material is (5S).\n    *   The hydride attack on the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new C3 center: (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of two ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** Both ketone groups are reduced, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The product is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   We need to determine the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Since the molecule is symmetrical about C3, we need to check for meso compounds.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) because of the identical substituents on C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. (Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I, diastereomer of 1)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, enantiomer of 3)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Each HPLC Experiment\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties. It will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will all elute at different times.\n*   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Chiral HPLC can do everything a normal-phase column can do (separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers), but it can **also separate enantiomers**.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of five unique stereoisomers:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of the above) will give a separate **1 peak**.\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of the above) will now be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer (diastereomer of the others) and will have its own retention time, giving **1 peak**.\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at C-5, with the (S) configuration. This chiral center is not involved in the reaction and its configuration will be retained.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces.\n    *   This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Since the original chiral center at C-5 remains (S), the two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs 3S). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is an **achiral** molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, these must be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the CH₂ group, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC Separation**\n\nThe combined final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It can separate structural isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute), giving a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are enantiomers. They will co-elute and produce **1 peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will not co-elute with each other.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that interact differently with the stationary phase.\n*   It can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Therefore, each distinct stereoisomer in the mixture should produce a separate peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (diastereomer, separates)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4 (enantiomer, separates on chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (diastereomer, separates)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule is already chiral (due to C5), these two attacks lead to the formation of two different products.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The starting stereocenter at C5 remains (S). The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter the same (S at C5) and one different (R/S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        4.  **(2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. They will be formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture) because the starting material is achiral.\n    *   Let's look at the (2R, 4S) isomer. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through C3. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), which means it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)/(2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a second peak. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are different compounds with different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other. Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This produces **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers from each other. This will produce 2 peaks. The meso compound is a distinct, achiral stereoisomer and will elute as its own peak. Thus, the three stereoisomers from Reaction II will be fully resolved. This produces **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is the sum from each group.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC numbering starts from the right to give the ketone the lowest number (3). So the carbon chain is C1 to C6 from right to left: CH₃(1)-CH₂(2)-C(=O)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(OCH₃)(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   There is a stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This molecule is a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the existing stereocenter at C5.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is sp²-hybridized and prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter, the attack of the hydride is on a chiral molecule. This will lead to the formation of two products which are diastereomers. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with *excess* NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (in a certain conformation) and is therefore a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a **pair of enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers** have different connectivity and will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol and the enantiomeric pair of pentane-2,4-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers. Thus, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate from each other and will form a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    3.  **Comparing Products from I and II:** The products of Reaction I are 5-methoxyhexan-3-ols (C₇H₁₆O₂), while the products of Reaction II are pentane-2,4-diols (C₅H₁₂O₂). These are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas, sizes, and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** Adding the peaks from each separable group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that have different three-dimensional shapes.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It also separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   Assuming an ideal chiral column with sufficient resolving power, all stereochemically unique compounds will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct (either constitutional isomers, diastereomers, or enantiomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will be resolved into a separate peak. Therefore, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. This new center can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction will produce a mixture of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). The reaction is unlikely to be 100% diastereoselective, so both products will be formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones. Since it is in excess, both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Because the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The molecule is symmetric around C3. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral precursor with an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry (and is superimposable on its mirror image, the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers**.\n*   The combined mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    *   From Rxn I: (3R, 5S)-diol and (3S, 5S)-diol. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties, so they will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   From Rxn II: a racemic mixture and a meso compound. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties, so they will be separated. The racemic pair will elute together as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak. This gives **two peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2). They have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   The column will have different interactions with each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the separable species:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of 1, separable)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomer of 3, separable on a chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, diastereomer of 3 & 4, separable)\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution, the chiral column will resolve all five stereoisomers.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nThere is a possible alternative interpretation where the question assumes low resolution for diastereomers on a normal-phase column, leading to 2 peaks. However, this contradicts the \"high-performance\" nature of HPLC. The interpretation that leads to option D requires several inconsistent assumptions (e.g., ignoring the products of one reaction in the second analysis), making it chemically less plausible. The most rigorous and consistent analysis points to 4 peaks on the normal-phase column and 5 peaks on the chiral-phase column.\n\nLet's revisit the options and reasoning.\n- Normal-Phase (achiral):\n  - (3R,5S)-diol vs (3S,5S)-diol -> diastereomers, separate (Peak 1, Peak 2)\n  - (rac)-diol vs (meso)-diol -> diastereomers, separate (Peak 3, Peak 4)\n  - C7 compounds vs C5 compounds are very different -> no overlap expected.\n  - **Result: 4 peaks**\n- Chiral Phase:\n  - Separates everything above.\n  - Additionally, separates the racemic pair: (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol become two separate peaks.\n  - The 4 peaks from normal phase become 5: Peak 1, Peak 2, Peak 3a (RR), Peak 3b (SS), Peak 4 (meso).\n  - **Result: 5 peaks**\n\nFinal Answer: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\nFinal check of the question options against my conclusion.\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nMy conclusion matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has a ketone functional group at position 3 and a single chiral center at position 5 with a specific (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`. The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride anion (H-) from LAH can attack the prochiral carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). Since there are no directing groups to favor one side of attack over the other, both possibilities will occur.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can be either (R) or (S). The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains (S).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (C5 is S) and the other is different (C3 is R or S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical diketone and is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since two chiral centers are formed (C2 and C4), we need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry in a certain conformation (it is identical to its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a **meso compound** and is achiral. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) designations describe the same single meso molecule.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The reduction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and their diastereomer, the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique that separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Separation rules:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will** be separated.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular formulas or connectivity (like the products of Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different properties and **will** be separated.\n*   **Counting the peaks:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The product mixture contains the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different polarities. Therefore, their peaks will not overlap. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and other structurally different molecules.\n*   **Separation rules:**\n    *   Enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and **will** be separated.\n    *   Diastereomers have different properties and **will** be separated.\n*   **Counting the peaks:** We need to count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** 2 distinct diastereomers were formed. These will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** 3 distinct stereoisomers were formed: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other, and it will also separate the meso diastereomer from the enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 compounds in the mixture is chemically distinct and can be separated by an ideal chiral column. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    The chiral center is C5: -CH(OCH3)-.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces a ketone to an alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** The carbonyl group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The carbon at C3 is a prochiral center because it is planar (sp2 hybridized) and has three different groups attached. The hydride ion (H-) from LAH can attack this carbonyl carbon from two different faces (top or bottom). This attack creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The new chiral center at C3 can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. This leads to the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is opposite). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reagent (LAH) is achiral, a mixture of these two diastereomers will be formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" means both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** The two carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are both reduced to hydroxyl groups, creating two new chiral centers. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** With two new chiral centers (C2 and C4), up to 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers are possible: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    Let's analyze their relationships:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be produced in equal amounts (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has chiral centers, but because the molecule is symmetric (the substituents on C2 are the same as on C4), there is an internal plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule achiral overall. This is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are diastereomers of the meso compound. In total, Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (molecules with different connectivity), which the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Enantiomers will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the number of expected peaks for the combined mixture:\n1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n    These are diastereomers, so they will be separated into **two peaks**.\n3.  The racemic mixture of **(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II). As enantiomers, they will not be separated and will give **one peak**.\n4.  The **meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II).\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, it will be separated from them, giving another **one peak**.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is reasonable as they are constitutional isomers with different formulas and functional groups), the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each group of isomers.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all compounds that normal-phase HPLC can (constitutional isomers, diastereomers).\n*   Crucially, it **can also separate enantiomers**.\n\nLet's count the peaks based on the total number of unique stereoisomers produced:\n*   **From Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    These are two distinct compounds and will give **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    These are enantiomers and will be separated by the chiral column into **two peaks**.\n    5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    This is a distinct stereoisomer (a diastereomer of the others) and will give its own **one peak**.\n\nThe total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture is 5. A chiral HPLC, under ideal conditions, can separate all of them.\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from the enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from the meso of Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: The parent chain is hexan-3-one, which is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.\n    *   There is a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. So the structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has a stereocenter at carbon 5 (the carbon bonded to the methoxy group), and its configuration is specified as (S). This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. It will reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The ether linkage at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting material is chiral and enantiomerically pure (at C5), the reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products.\n    *   The original stereocenter (5S) remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (because one center is the same (S) while the other is different (R vs S)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is a symmetric molecule and is **achiral**.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), 2. Acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The use of \"excess\" NaBH4 ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   This product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group. A molecule with stereocenters that is superimposable on its mirror image is called a **meso compound**. The mirror image of (2R, 4S) is (2S, 4R), and they are the same, identical molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the reduction of the achiral starting material produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Products in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as **one peak**.\n    *   Product 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of products 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the peak containing the enantiomers. This gives a **second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different and will have significantly different polarities and retention times. Thus, none of the peaks are expected to overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** Same 5 compounds as above.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. The chiral column will interact differently with each, leading to their separation into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   Product 5 (meso compound) is a diastereomer of the others and will also be separated, giving its own **third peak** from the Reaction II products.\n    *   Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different classes of molecules and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, and a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. Therefore, we will observe 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the problem to determine the number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing stereocenter at carbon C5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   The chiral center is C5: `-CH(OCH3)-`\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material has a stereocenter at C5 which is unaffected by the reaction, and a new stereocenter is formed at C3, the products will be diastereomers. The hydride attack on the prochiral ketone is not stereospecific, so it can attack from either face, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n    *   Product 1a: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1b: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric diketone and is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** \"Excess\" NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers [(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)] and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 3 and 4) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They elute together, giving a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like compounds 1 and 2; or the pair {3,4} and compound 5) have different physical properties and **will** be separated.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They have different molecular weights, functional groups, and polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   Products from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They will separate. **→ 2 peaks**\n*   Products from Reaction II:\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will elute together. **→ 1 peak**\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time. **→ 1 peak**\n    *   Total from Reaction II products = 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and different constitutional isomers.\n*   Since the chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers, each of the five unique compounds in the mixture will be resolved.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol **→ 1 peak**\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol **→ 1 peak**\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol **→ 1 peak**\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (separated from its enantiomer, #3) **→ 1 peak**\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, but is a unique molecule and diastereomer to the others) **→ 1 peak**\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at position 3 is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) can occur from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3. This new center can have either an (R) or an (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers** of each other. Since the starting material is chiral, the reaction is diastereoselective, meaning the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical, achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃), has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)** is a **meso compound** because it is symmetrical and has a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same achiral molecule.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent must result in an optically inactive product mixture.\n    1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    2.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    So, there are three distinct stereoisomers produced.\n\n**Step 3: Count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced.**\n*   From Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.\n*   From Reaction II: 1 pair of enantiomers (2 compounds) and 1 meso compound. Total of 3 stereoisomers.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will not be identical.\n*   Total number of unique stereoisomeric products = 2 + 3 = **5**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of peaks on the Chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between different stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the combined product mixture, an ideal chiral HPLC column will separate all of them.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of peaks on the Normal-Phase HPLC.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's analyze the product mixture:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture) and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers, (2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. So, the meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   This gives **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) and Reaction II (pentanediols) have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   This corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n**Detailed Analysis and Reasoning**\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH is achiral and can attack the carbonyl group from either face (*re* face or *si* face).\n*   **Products:** This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already has a chiral center at C5, the two possible products will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct compounds (diastereomers) are formed. Let's call them **D1** and **D2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetrical beta-diketone (CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃) and is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** \"Excess\" NaBH₄ indicates that both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are all achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The product is pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃).\n    *   Let's analyze the stereoisomers. With two chiral centers, there are a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical around C3.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a racemic mixture. Let's call these **E1** and **E2**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-CH₂ group. Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same meso compound. Let's call this **M**.\n    *   The meso compound (M) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers (E1 and E2).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the products and analyze with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Total Mixture:** The final mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    *   **D1** and **D2** (diastereomers from Reaction I)\n    *   **E1**, **E2** (enantiomers from Reaction II), and **M** (meso compound from Reaction II)\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC Separation Principle:** This technique uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like D1 and D2) have different physical properties and thus **are separated**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **are not separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The **meso compound (M)** is a diastereomer of E1 and E2, so it has different physical properties and **will be separated** from the E1/E2 peak.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) – they have different molecular weights, chain lengths, and functional groups. Therefore, the set of compounds from Reaction I will be separated from the set of compounds from Reaction II.\n*   **Counting the Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    1.  **Peak 1:** D1\n    2.  **Peak 2:** D2\n    3.  **Peak 3:** E1 and E2 (co-eluting enantiomeric pair)\n    4.  **Peak 4:** M (meso compound)\n*   **Total:** **4 peaks** will be observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Separation Principle:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** The chiral column can distinguish between all five unique stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   **Counting the Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    1.  **Peak 1:** D1 ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol)\n    2.  **Peak 2:** D2 ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol)\n    3.  **Peak 3:** E1 ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n    4.  **Peak 4:** E2 ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n    5.  **Peak 5:** M (meso-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   **Total:** **5 peaks** will be observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n        *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5. The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃. The stereocenter at C-5 is fixed in the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), followed by an acidic workup.\n        *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 will create a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, and the hydride ion can attack from either the *re* or *si* face.\n    *   **Products:** Since the starting material has one chiral center (C-5), and a new one is formed at C-3, the products will be diastereomers. The configuration at C-5 remains (S). The new center at C-3 can be either (R) or (S).\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n        *   The structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup.\n        *   NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent than LAH, but it readily reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" implies both ketone groups will be reduced.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reduction of both carbonyl groups at C-2 and C-4 will form a diol, pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Products:** New chiral centers are formed at C-2 and C-4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the molecule, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same compound. This compound has a plane of symmetry passing through C-3 and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture for HPLC:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n    *   Let's group the compounds based on how they will behave in normal-phase HPLC:\n        *   **Group A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   **Group B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. A and B are diastereomers and have different polarities. They will give two separate peaks.\n        *   **Group C:** The enantiomeric pair of {(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol}. They will co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   **Group D:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol. This is a diastereomer of the compounds in Group C, so it has a different polarity and will elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Furthermore, the compounds from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the compounds from Reaction II (diols). They have different molecular formulas (C₇H₁₆O₂ vs C₅H₁₂O₂) and polarities. Thus, it's certain that the peaks from Reaction I products will not co-elute with peaks from Reaction II products.\n    *   Therefore, we will observe four distinct peaks corresponding to Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D.\n    *   **Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4.**\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n    *   A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers, provided they are not identical.\n    *   Our mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n    *   Each of these five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and, assuming sufficient column resolution, will elute at a different time.\n    *   **Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's number the carbon chain starting from the right to give the methoxy group the lowest number as per its name origin, though IUPAC would prefer numbering from the left to give the ketone a lower number (2-methoxyhexan-4-one). However, let's stick to the name provided: the carbonyl is at C3 and the methoxy is at C5. Structure: CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral because of the stereocenter at C5, which is given in the (S) configuration. It is an enantiomerically pure starting material.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    *   This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3. The carbonyl carbon is planar (sp² hybridized), and the hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule already contains a stereocenter (at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally likely from both sides, leading to an unequal mixture of diastereomers. However, *both* possible diastereomers will be formed, as these reactions are rarely 100% diastereoselective.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two stereocenters, at C3 and C5.\n    *   Since the stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" means both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   We need to consider all possible stereoisomers. With 2 stereocenters, there is a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers.\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Let's check for relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 mixture (a racemic mixture).\n        *   Now consider (2R, 4S). If we look at this molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-CH₂ group. This makes it an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is superimposable on the original (2R, 4S) molecule. So, they are the same compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: the racemic pair of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), and the meso compound (2R, 4S).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will not separate and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a second peak.\n    *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products of Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally very different and will not co-elute by chance.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Products with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is a **chiral** separation technique.\n*   **Key principle:** A chiral column can separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can resolve all different stereoisomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). They are both chiral and different compounds, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be separated by the chiral column. This gives 2 distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral, but it is a distinct stereoisomer and will be separated from the other two compounds. This gives a third peak.\n    *   This gives a total of **3 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Again, assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option that states \"5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\".\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The '(S)' designation indicates it is a single, pure enantiomer.\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH(S)-CH3\n                    |\n                   OCH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from either the front face or the back face, both possible configurations at C3 will be formed.\n*   **Products:** The reaction starts with a molecule having the (S) configuration at C5 and generates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n      O     O\n      \\\\   //\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is also a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl (-OH) groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    ```\n      OH    OH\n      |     |\n    CH3-CH-CH2-CH-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Products:** Since two chiral centers are formed, we must consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4 (through the central CH2 group).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are mirror images of each other and are not superimposable. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, these enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) configuration is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This is because of the internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R))\n    The enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) are diastereomers of the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n*   **From Rxn I:** Two diastereomers.\n*   **From Rxn II:** A pair of enantiomers and one meso compound (a total of three stereoisomers).\n\nNow let's consider the two HPLC methods:\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products of Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated from each other. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, so it will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n4.  The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are completely different molecules (constitutional isomers), ensuring they elute at different times.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate all different stereoisomers (constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers), assuming ideal resolution.\n\nLet's count the peaks by counting every unique molecule in the mixture:\n*   From Reaction I:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 1**)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 2**)\n*   From Reaction II:\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 3**)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 4**, separated from its enantiomer)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 5**)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. The carbonyl group (C=O) at position C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-OH). This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The starting material already has a chiral center at C5, which remains unchanged ((S)-configuration). The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of both possible configurations at the new stereocenter (R) and (S).

This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the attack on the two faces is not equally probable, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH4 is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH4) are both achiral, the reaction must produce an overall achiral mixture. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. Since the reaction is not stereospecific, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is a meso compound and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Combined Products:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a **separate peak**. This gives two peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C9H20O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase can differentiate between chiral molecules, including enantiomers, because they interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other. The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, into **two separate peaks**. The meso compound is achiral, but it is a diastereomer of the other two and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, eluting as its own **separate peak**. This gives three peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   Again, the products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The stereocenter is at carbon C5, which is bonded to -H, -CH₃, -OCH₃, and -CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The problem states the configuration at C5 is (S). This is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so its configuration remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either the front face or the back face of this planar group.\n    *   This attack creates two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   Because the starting material is chiral (has a stereocenter at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack will not be a 50:50 mixture, but it will produce both possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The overall mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central CH₂ group. It is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The products are:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.

(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and **can be separated**.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular structures (constitutional isomers or simply different molecules) have different properties and **can be separated**.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers.

Let's break down the name to understand the structure. \"hexan-3-one\" indicates a six-carbon chain with a ketone group at carbon 3. \"5-methoxy\" means a -OCH3 group is attached to carbon 5. \"(S)\" specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is carbon 5 (it's bonded to H, CH3, OCH3, and a larger alkyl ketone group).\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). The acidic workup is to protonate the resulting alkoxide ion.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the C3 ketone. The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. The reduction of the planar sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbon at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** This reaction produces two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I yields a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical molecule with two ketone groups. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the alkoxides.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers have an internal plane of symmetry, making them an achiral **meso compound**. They are the same molecule.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction will produce an optically inactive mixture. This means the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture), along with the meso compound. Therefore, Reaction II yields **three stereoisomeric products**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separability:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable on an achiral column. This gives **1 peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are also structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be well separated. The total number of peaks is the sum of the separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from meso of Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The interactions between each enantiomer and the chiral stationary phase are diastereomeric in nature, resulting in different retention times.\n*   **Separability:** Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined product mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column is designed to resolve them all. Therefore, we would expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means two diastereomeric products will be formed, generally in unequal amounts.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). Because the reactant and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the groups attached to C2 and C4 are identical), there are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Normal-Phase HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment:\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n\nThe combined mixture contains five compounds in total: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers, however, will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I are methoxy-alcohols, while the products from Reaction II are diols. These two classes of compounds have significantly different structures and polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks on a normal-phase column will be the sum of the peaks from each group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The column creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n\nThe mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nSince all five of these compounds are stereochemically different from one another, a chiral column is expected to resolve all of them.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the others (as it's a diastereomer to them).\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be resolved from each other.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution, each of the five stereoisomers will produce a separate peak. This results in a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. The chemical formula is C7H14O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and it is given as the pure (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride): This is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S), as the hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Since these two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a beta-diketone. The chemical formula is C5H8O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride): This is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxides to form the final diol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Starting from an achiral molecule with an achiral reagent, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n        *   Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product E: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Products C and D are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product E, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Product E: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nWe need to determine how many peaks are observed on two different types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase (achiral) column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   Products A and B are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   Products C and D are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n*   Product E is a diastereomer of C and D. It will separate from the C/D pair, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (A and B) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C, D, and E), so they will all be well-separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from A and B) + 1 (from C+D) + 1 (from E) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, **and** enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture will be separated from all the others, assuming the column has adequate resolving power.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n*   Product A will be separated.\n*   Product B will be separated.\n*   Product C will be separated.\n*   Product D will be separated (from its enantiomer, C).\n*   Product E will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). It is a chiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The starting material is chiral ((S) at C5). The reduction of the carbonyl at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter (R or S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the starting material is chiral, the transition states leading to the two products are diastereomeric, meaning the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts (diastereoselective reaction), but both will be present in the product mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no stereocenters.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols. The acidic workup provides the protons.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2ⁿ = 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S): These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S): This stereoisomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry (when drawn in the correct conformation). A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC (an achiral technique) separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since they are diastereomers, they have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute as a single peak. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    3.  **Overall:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. There is no risk of accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each stereoisomer, leading to different retention times.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all such stereoisomers. Each of these five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will therefore be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Total = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5 with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the products:** The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces (re and si faces). Since the existing chiral center at C5 is relatively far from the reacting C3 carbonyl, there is no significant steric influence to favor one side of attack over the other. Therefore, both possible configurations at C3, (R) and (S), will be formed in roughly equal amounts.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the two carbonyls creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups can lead to different combinations of stereoconfigurations at C2 and C4.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between the stereoisomers:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom and is therefore a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   (2S, 4R) is the mirror image of (2R, 4S), but because the molecule is meso, it is superimposable on (2R, 4S). Thus, they are the same compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)- or (2S, 4R)-)\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers. So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture contains five unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (except for interaction with chiral entities) and therefore cannot be separated on an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (and structurally different molecules in general) have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different properties, and will give a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇ mono-alcohols with an ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Thus, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with peaks from Reaction II.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   Chiral columns can separate both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   A chiral column will resolve all five of them.\n    1.

This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   C5 is the chiral center.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can occur from two different faces of the planar carbonyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Since there is already a chiral center at C5, the two possible outcomes of the attack on C3 will result in the formation of two diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** This molecule has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric. Let's check for a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2R, 4S) form has such a plane of symmetry (and is identical to the (2S, 4R) form). Therefore, it is a single, achiral meso compound.\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, there is no preference for the formation of one enantiomer over the other. They will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Products and Analyze by HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It is an achiral technique.\n*   **Enantiomers**, such as (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the chiral pentane-2,4-diols. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, appearing as its own peak.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5H12O2). They are structurally different and will have different polarities, so they will be separated from the products of Reaction II.\n\nCounting the peaks for normal-phase HPLC:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 3: The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (elute together)\n*   Peak 4: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n**Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities, which leads to different retention times.\n*   Therefore, a chiral HPLC column can separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n\nCounting the peaks for chiral HPLC:\n*   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of peak 1)\n*   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of peak 3)\n*   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of peaks 3 & 4)\n**Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5**\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a six-carbon chain.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at position C3.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position C5.\n    *   There is a single stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is (S). This stereocenter will not be altered during the reaction.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. The stereocenter is the carbon with the methoxy group.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter at this position.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The reaction creates a mixture of two products. Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the two products are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers**. They have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements at one (but not all) stereocenters. Diastereomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone with a five-carbon chain.\n    *   The carbonyl groups are at positions C2 and C4.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** as it has a plane of symmetry and no stereocenters.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   With two stereocenters, there is a maximum of 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers. We need to examine their relationships.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH₂ group. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral)\n    *   The two enantiomers are formed as a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. It can, however, separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   **Total Compounds:** We have a mixture of 5 compounds in total (2 from Reaction I and 3 from Reaction II).\n    *   **From Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and have different polarities. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it has a different polarity and will be separated from them, giving a second peak.\n        *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   **Overall:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = (Peaks from I) + (Peaks from II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. In essence, it can separate all stereochemically unique molecules.\n*   **Total Compounds:** We have 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral)\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The chiral column will resolve all 5 distinct compounds.\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers and will be separated.\n    *   P3 and P4 are enantiomers and will be separated by the chiral column.\n    *   P5 is a diastereomer of P3/P4 and will be separated from them.\n    *   The products from Reaction I are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II, so they will all have unique retention times.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks**, one for each unique compound in the mixture.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's determine the structure and identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates a 6-carbon chain (hexane). A ketone group is at position 3, and a methoxy group is at position 5.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃\n    *   The problem states there is a stereocenter at position 5 with (S) configuration. This center is not involved in the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The C3 carbon is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can occur from two different faces of the planar carbonyl group. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can be either (R) or (S). The original stereocenter at C5 remains (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. The configuration is the same at C5 but different at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers are distinct compounds with different physical properties. Reaction I produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" means both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric around the central CH₂ group (C3). The substituents on C2 and C4 are identical (H, OH, CH₃, and the rest of the molecule).\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a **pair of enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) and is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 4R) form. Therefore, (2R, 4S) is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Products:** Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n*   From Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. (Two diastereomers)\n*   From Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol. (A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound, which is a diastereomer of the enantiomers).\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers**, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the separable groups:\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I are **diastereomers**. They have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak for the meso compound**.\n    3.  The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated from each other and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak for the enantiomeric pair**.\n    4.  The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They are constitutional isomers (if they had the same formula) or, in this case, simply completely different molecules with different structures, formulas, and polarities. They will certainly be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = (Peak for product 1 from Rxn I) + (Peak for product 2 from Rxn I) + (Peak for meso compound from Rxn II) + (Peak for enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, every stereoisomerically distinct compound in the mixture can be separated from the others (assuming an effective column).\n*   Let's count the distinct compounds:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This stereocenter will not be affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. Since there is already a stereocenter at C5, the two faces are diastereotopic. This means the attack from the two sides will lead to the formation of two different products, which are diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Reaction I produces a mixture of two compounds that are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃(C=O)CH₂(C=O)CH₃.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The product molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the resulting mixture of stereoisomers must be optically inactive overall. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction produces them in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The molecule has equivalent stereocenters (C2 and C4). Therefore, the (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound (it is superimposable on the (2R, 4S) isomer).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Reaction II produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), but it cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated, producing a **second peak**.\n    *   So, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column.\n*   **Combined Analysis:** The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂). They have different molecular weights, polarities, and structures. Therefore, it is expected that all separable groups will have unique retention times (no accidental co-elution).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, as they will interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of these unique stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers), and assuming no accidental overlap between the structurally different molecules from the two reactions, each compound will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is the carbon with the methoxy group.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the original stereocenter at C5, so it remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This non-selective attack creates both possible configurations at C3, i.e., (R) and (S).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (because one center is the same (S) while the other is different (R vs. S)). They are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetric diketone: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these possibilities:\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**.\n        *   **(2S, 4R):** This is identical to the (2R, 4S) meso compound (you can confirm this by rotating the molecule).\n    *   Therefore, three stereoisomers are formed:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of the above)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined products with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It is an **achiral** technique.\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **cannot** be separated (they co-elute as a single peak).\n*   The combined mixture contains 5 total compounds from the two reactions.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different properties, they will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different retention time. The two enantiomers will co-elute. This results in **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair of enantiomers).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally very different molecules. It is extremely unlikely that any product from Reaction I would co-elute with a product from Reaction II.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC** = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined products with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can separate molecules that differ in their three-dimensional structure.\n*   **Key principle:** Chiral HPLC can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column can distinguish between all of these. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be separated. The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer to all the other chiral products and will also have a unique retention time.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 compounds will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC** = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and it is provided as a pure enantiomer (S).\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The starting material already has a stereocenter at C5 ((S)-configuration). The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 can result in either an (R) or (S) configuration at the new stereocenter. This leads to the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Because the reaction occurs under the influence of an existing chiral center, these two diastereomers will be formed in unequal amounts (this is known as asymmetric induction). However, for the purpose of counting peaks, we know that two distinct compounds are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3) and is an achiral **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH₄) are both achiral, the reaction cannot favor one enantiomer over the other. Therefore, the chiral products, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be formed in equal amounts, creating a **racemic mixture**. The meso compound will also be formed.\n*   So, Reaction II produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: the racemic pair of enantiomers and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions:\n*   From Rxn I: Two diastereomers ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol).\n*   From Rxn II: Three stereoisomers ((2R, 4R)-, (2S, 4S)-, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\nThe products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, no product from Reaction I will co-elute (have the same retention time) with any product from Reaction II on any HPLC column. We can simply add the number of peaks from each reaction's products.\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity).\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn I:** The two diastereomers will have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will have a different polarity, thus eluting as a separate peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Peaks from Rxn II:** The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)). The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is given as (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new chiral center (R or S). Since there is already a chiral center in the molecule, the two products formed will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketones react. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (they are superimposable). So, there is only one meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The mixture contains the five stereoisomers produced in both reactions.\n    *   Products from Rxn I: (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Products from Rxn II: The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they will elute together as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different (different molecular weight, functional groups, and polarity). It is certain they will not co-elute (i.e., elute at the same time).\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers).\n*   **Combined Mixture:** The mixture contains five stereochemically distinct compounds.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all five distinct stereoisomers, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. This is followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. Therefore, two products are formed:\n    *   Product 1 (P1): (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2 (P2): (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** P1 and P2 have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The problem states \"excess\" NaBH4, ensuring both ketone groups are reduced. This is followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. We need to determine the possible stereoisomers. The molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C4) and is symmetric.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (P3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (P4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is a **meso compound** (P5) due to an internal plane of symmetry. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship and Mixture Composition:** Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, the product mixture must be optically inactive. This means that the chiral products, P3 and P4, must be formed in equal amounts as a **racemic mixture**. The meso compound, P5, is also formed. Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers (P3 and P4) and a meso compound (P5). P5 is a diastereomer of P3 and P4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will give **two separate peaks**.\n    *   P3 and P4 are enantiomers, so they have the same polarity and will co-elute, giving **one single peak**.\n    *   P5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of P3 and P4. Therefore, it has a different polarity and will give a **separate peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They will have significantly different polarities and retention times, so there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Counting the peaks:** We have four groups of compounds that are separable on a normal-phase column: {P1}, {P2}, {P3+P4}, and {P5}.\n*   **Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** There will be a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities. Chiral HPLC can, of course, also separate diastereomers. In short, it can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}. These are five distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1 ((3R, 5S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P2 ((3S, 5S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P3 ((2R, 4R)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P4 ((2S, 4S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak (separated from its enantiomer P3)\n    *   P5 (meso-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak (separated from all others as it is a diastereomer)\n*   **Counting the peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** There will be a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in two separate reactions and then determining how these products will be separated using two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   There is a pre-existing stereocenter at C-5 with the (S) configuration. This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C-3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule already contains a stereocenter at C-5, these two faces are diastereotopic. The attack from one face will lead to the (3S) alcohol, and the attack from the other face will lead to the (3R) alcohol. The stereocenter at C-5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n    The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, this pair of chiral products will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a meso compound. It is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) and is achiral.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The first two are produced as a single racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It operates in an achiral environment.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's analyze the combined product mixture:\n*   **From Reaction I:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The racemic mixture of [(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The racemic pair and the meso compound are diastereomers and will be separated. The two enantiomers within the racemic mixture will elute together. This gives **two distinct peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   We have a total of five distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.

Assuming an ideal separation with no accidental co-elution, each compound will produce its own peak.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at carbon C3. This carbon is prochiral, meaning a reaction at this site can create a new chiral center.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone C=O group to a secondary alcohol C-OH group.\n    *   The reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule is already chiral (due to the (S) center at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally probable, leading to an unequal mixture of two diastereomeric products.\n    *   The configuration at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction. The new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same ((S) at C5) and the other being different ((R) vs (S) at C3).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no chiral centers. It has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (an equal amount of each enantiomer).\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of enantiomers. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it's superimposable on its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a meso compound, which is achiral.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n        1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        2.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate structurally different compounds and diastereomers. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment.\n*   **The combined mixture contains:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarity and will co-elute (not separate). This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso form) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will be separate from the peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peak for Cpd 1) + (Peak for Cpd 2) + (Peak for Cpds 3 & 4) + (Peak for Cpd 5) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all different stereoisomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column is designed to separate such isomers, we expect each compound to produce a separate peak (assuming ideal separation conditions).\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OCH(CH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates the stereocenter is at C5, and its configuration is (S). The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) can occur from either the Re face or the Si face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule already has a stereocenter at C5 (which remains unchanged), the products will be diastereomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers. Since they are formed from a chiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** We obtain **2 distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and does not have any stereocenters. It is achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a diketone with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that converts ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   Starting with an achiral molecule and an achiral reagent, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers. They will be produced as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule, just rotated.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** We obtain **3 distinct stereoisomeric products** (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the total mixture of products**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. The stationary phase is polar (e.g., silica).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **can be separated** and will give distinct peaks.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers. They will elute together as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different polarity and produce a separate peak (**1 peak**).\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II will give a total of 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (one -OH, one ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (two -OH groups) and will have significantly different polarities. Thus, it's safe to assume their peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Since we have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our final mixture, and chiral HPLC can resolve them all, we expect to see one peak for each compound.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (It will have a diastereomeric interaction with the CSP relative to the chiral isomers, so it will also be separated).\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a single stereocenter at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-O-C*H(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, where C* is the chiral center.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products which are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed. Let's call them Product A and Product B.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure of the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and is therefore a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (they are superimposable).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Let's call this Product C)\n    *   A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product D) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   **Product A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product C:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product D:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product E:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each HPLC experiment.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and therefore cannot be separated. They co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   Products A and B are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Product C (meso) is a diastereomer of products D and E. Therefore, C will be separated from the D/E pair.\n    *   Products D and E are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   So, the products from Reaction II will give **two peaks** in total on a normal-phase column (one for C, one for the D+E pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nA chiral stationary phase allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers (A, B, C, D, E).\n*   Product A and Product B are diastereomers and will be resolved.

They will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   All five compounds (A, B, C, D, E) are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in different retention times.\n*   Therefore, all five stereoisomers will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The main chain is a hexane with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. The numbering starts from the end closer to the ketone.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces (re or si face).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (its configuration is still S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric alcohol products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry through the central CH2 group).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The use of \"excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between products:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), making it an achiral molecule. This is a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a separate, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The compounds from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the compounds from Reaction II (C5 diols). Their polarities will be different, so there will be no accidental overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate both **diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a separate peak (assuming the column is effective and there's no accidental co-elution, which is the standard assumption for such problems).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We count the number of unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   This gives a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    Let's draw the structure. It's a 6-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at C5. The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n    ```\n          O\n          ||\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3\n    1   2  3  4   5        6\n    ```\n    The molecule has one chiral center at C5, with the (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is prochiral (a planar sp2 carbon). The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Attack from one face gives the (3R) alcohol.\n    *   Attack from the other face gives the (3S) alcohol.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Since the C5 configuration remains (S), two products are formed:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two chiral centers. They have the same configuration at one center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Note that because the starting material is chiral, these two diastereomers will likely be formed in unequal amounts.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    ```\n          O       O\n          ||      ||\n    CH3 - C - CH2 - C - CH3\n    1   2   3   4   5\n    ```\n    This molecule is achiral and has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n    NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, creating two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The two new chiral centers at C2 and C4 can have either (R) or (S) configurations. The possible combinations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** Let's check for internal symmetry. The molecule is symmetrical around the central CH2 group. If we consider the (2R, 4S) structure, it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) structure is identical to the (2R, 4S) structure (it can be superimposed by rotation).\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Chiral)\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Chiral, enantiomer of the above)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Achiral)\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined into a single sample. This sample contains a total of **five** distinct chemical compounds (two diastereomers from Reaction I, and one pair of enantiomers + one meso compound from Reaction II).\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It is an **achiral** technique.\n*   Achiral techniques **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and will therefore have the same retention time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Achiral techniques **can** separate diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will have different retention times.\n*   Let's identify the separable species in the mixture:\n    1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol:** A distinct compound.\n    2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol:** The diastereomer of compound 1. It will be separated.\n    3.  **meso-pentane-2,4-diol:** A distinct achiral compound.\n    4.  **The racemic mixture of (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** These are enantiomers and will elute together as a single peak. This enantiomeric pair and the meso-diol are diastereomers of each other, so they will be separated.\n*   Furthermore, the products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities. Thus, all four of these groups should be separable.\n*   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can distinguish between stereoisomers that have different 3D shapes.\n*   It **can** separate enantiomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers.\n*   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical. Our mixture contains five non-identical stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   All five of these compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position, and its configuration is given as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The ketone group is at C3.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The carbon of the ketone (C3) is prochiral. Its reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the hydride attack can occur from two different faces of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of two products. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they form an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses achiral reagents, this pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (1:1 ratio).\n    *   (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same molecule. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the C3-CH₂ group) and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and one racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture**\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Step 4: Predict the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated on a normal-phase (achiral) column. They will elute together, giving a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on a normal-phase column.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** have different structures and are also separable.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((3) and (4)) and a meso compound ((5)). The enantiomers will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will have a different retention time and give a separate peak, which is **1 peak**. In total, the products from Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂, alcohol-ethers) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂, diols). They have significantly different structures and polarities. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that any product from Reaction I would co-elute with a product from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral HPLC column can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   Our mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers (listed in Step 3).\n*   A chiral column will resolve all of them:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (different from Peak 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4 (separated from its enantiomer, Peak 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (different from all others)\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a chiral molecule containing one stereocenter at carbon C-5, with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This leads to the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   The stereocenter at C-5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains (S).\n    *   Therefore, the products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   The two products have the configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). Since they have two stereocenters, and the configuration is the same at one center (C-5) but different at the other (C-3), they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   The reaction starts with a chiral compound, so the two diastereomers are generally formed in unequal amounts, but since the reaction goes to 100% completion, both will be present in the final mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketones are reduced.\n*   **Product Formation:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reduction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   With two stereocenters, there are up to 2² = 4 possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, this enantiomeric pair will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts of each).\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has chiral centers but is an achiral molecule overall because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound, just viewed differently.\n        *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The final mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine the number of peaks observed on each type of HPLC column.\n\n**A) Normal-phase HPLC (achiral stationary phase):**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus different polarities. They **can be separated**.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S)) are diastereomers. They will be separated from each other. The two enantiomers, however, will elute together. This results in **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (chiral stationary phase):**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture can be resolved into a separate peak (assuming a suitable chiral column is used, which is the standard assumption in such problems).\n*   Let's count the peaks from the 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak**\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomer)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak**\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separated from its enantiomer)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomers)\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe final analysis shows that there will be **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with the formula CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It possesses one chiral center at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration. Since the problem specifies the configuration, we are starting with an enantiomerically pure compound.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide ion to form the alcohol.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** The carbonyl group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by this reaction.\n    *   Since the attack happens at a prochiral center in a molecule that is already chiral, the two transition states are diastereomeric. This leads to the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other. They are typically not formed in a 1:1 ratio, but two distinct products are formed.\n\n4.  **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other, hence they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a diketone with the formula CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has no stereocenters and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" implies that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** Both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry of Products:**\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbon. Therefore, it is an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image is (2S, 4R), which is identical to (2R, 4S).\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatography Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus **will be separated**. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II are one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. It will be separated from them, giving **1 peak**.\n        *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the racemic pair.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers. They have different molecular weights, structures, and polarities, so they will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The chiral column will separate all five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, assuming the column is appropriate for these compounds.\n        *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n        *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of Peak 1)\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomer of Peak 3)\n        *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, achiral and diastereomer of Peaks 3 & 4)\n*   **Total Peaks:** The chiral column can resolve all five unique stereoisomers. This gives a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis question asks for the number of peaks observed in two different types of HPLC experiments (normal-phase and chiral) for a mixture of reaction products. To answer this, we need to determine the products of each reaction and then analyze how they would be separated by each chromatographic technique.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, as indicated by the (S) designation for the stereocenter at carbon 5. The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, meaning the hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face (top or bottom).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** Since the original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, it remains in the (S) configuration. The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Products A and B have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃). This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent, and \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃). The reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. We must consider the configurations at C2 and C4.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is identical to (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers** and are formed as a 1:1 mixture, known as a racemic mixture. Let's call these Product C and Product D.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. Let's call this Product E.\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces a total of **three stereoisomers**: one racemic pair (C and D) and one meso compound (E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the separation of the combined product mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers: A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n**A. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties (including polarity). It **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products A and B:** They are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products C and D:** They are enantiomers. They have identical polarities and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the pair.\n    3.  **Product E:** This is a meso compound. It is a diastereomer of C and D. It has different physical properties and polarity and will be separated from the peak containing C and D. This gives **1 peak**.\n    4.  **Products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II:** The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) and Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) are structurally very different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂). They will have different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** We have four separable groups: A, B, (C+D), and E. Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**B. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:** The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers (A, B, C, D, E). A chiral column is designed to resolve such a mixture.\n    1.  **Product A:** ((3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) -> **1 peak**\n    2.  **Product B:** ((3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) -> **1 peak** (separated from A)\n    3.  **Product C:** ((2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak**\n    4.  **Product D:** ((2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak** (separated from its enantiomer, C)\n    5.  **Product E:** (meso-pentane-2,4-diol) -> **1 peak** (separated from its diastereomers, C and D)\n\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers will be resolved. Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a six-carbon chain.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face (re or si face) of the carbonyl plane.\n    *   This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral and the reagent (LAH) is achiral, the attack is not stereospecific. It will lead to the formation of both possible configurations at C3, which are (R) and (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The products are stereoisomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Since the configuration at C5 is fixed as (S) and the new center at C3 can be (R) or (S), two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same and the other being opposite.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   New chiral centers are created at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   We need to consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers are identical and represent a single achiral compound called a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers) if the product is chiral. It will also produce any possible meso compounds.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol [(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol]\n        2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        (where the latter two form a racemic mixture).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:**\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1)\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2)\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer +)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer -)\n\n**Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like the pair from Reaction II) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like the pair from Reaction I) have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC, showing up as distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different polarities. Thus, they will be separated from the diols.\n*   Let's count the number of species that can be separated:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of 1, so it separates)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomers co-elute; this species is a diastereomer of Peak 3, so it separates)\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between these four chemically distinct species, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers.\n*   It will resolve all stereoisomers in the mixture that have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Let's count the number of distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3, achiral compound, gives one peak)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, enantiomer of 4, separates on chiral column)\n*   All five of these stereoisomers are chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule. The structure is:\n    ```\n        O\n        ||\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH-CH3\n                     |\n                     OCH3\n    ```\n    The stereocenter is at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S). The molecule is chiral.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. Since the starting material is chiral (due to the stereocenter at C5), the transition states leading to the two possible configurations at C3 are diastereomeric. This means the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts. However, regardless of the ratio, two distinct products will be formed.\n\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged: (S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** and **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**.\n\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products have two stereocenters. One center has the same configuration (S), while the other is different (R vs. S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images are called **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I produces a mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    ```\n        O      O\n        ||     ||\n    CH3-C -CH2- C-CH3\n    ```\n    This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The \"excess\" reagent ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reduction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    ```\n        OH     OH\n        |      |\n    CH3-CH -CH2- CH-CH3\n    ```\n    We need to determine the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (which is identical to (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n*   **Relationship between Products:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)) will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the pair. This gives **1 peak** for the meso compound.\n*   The enantiomers from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate on an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the enantiomeric pair.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutionally different molecules, so they will certainly have different retention times.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso from Rxn II) + 1 (enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase.\n*   It **can** separate all different stereoisomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The chiral column will separate every unique stereoisomer present in the mixture. Since we have identified 5 distinct stereoisomeric products, and assuming no accidental co-elution (which is a standard assumption in such problems), we will see one peak for each.\n1.  Peak for (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Peak for (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Peak for (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n4.  Peak for (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Peak for (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The existing stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This leads to the formation of two products:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the attack of the hydride is generally not stereospecific without a directing group, both diastereomers will be formed.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to secondary alcohols. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers for a molecule with two stereocenters (C2 and C4).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, these will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), which makes it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (just flipping the molecule upside down).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (like the products from Reaction I and Reaction II, which have different molecular formulas C7H16O2 vs C5H12O2).\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II's products, the meso compound (3) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((4) and (5)). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the pair. This gives **1 peak** for the meso compound.\n*   The enantiomers from Reaction II ((4) and (5)) cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak** for the racemic pair.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally very different, all these peaks will be distinct.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (meso diol) + 1 (racemic diol) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\nHPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers. Assuming an effective chiral column, it should be able to resolve all structurally different molecules.\n*   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers ((1), (2), (3), (4), and (5)).\n*   A chiral column will separate the diastereomers ((1) vs (2); and (3) vs (4)/(5)).\n*   Crucially, a chiral column will also separate the enantiomeric pair ((4) vs (5)).\n*   Therefore, each of the five compounds in the mixture will produce a separate peak.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. Let's identify the chiral center. The name indicates the stereochemistry at carbon 5 is (S).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol group (CH-OH).\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction.\n    *   The ketone at C3 is prochiral. The incoming hydride ion can attack from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements at one (but not all) stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is symmetric and achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product Analysis:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. The reaction is expected to produce them in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. It is a **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of **three stereoisomers**: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Separation on Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated (they co-elute, appearing as a single peak).\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) + (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomers, so it will elute at a different time, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   Total from Reaction II is 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** We need to consider if peaks from Reaction I products might accidentally overlap with peaks from Reaction II products.\n    *   Reaction I products: C₇H₁₆O₂ (ether-alcohols)\n    *   Reaction II products: C₅H₁₂O₂ (diols)\n    *   The compounds have different molecular formulas, molecular weights, and functionalities (one ether and one alcohol vs. two alcohols). Their polarities will be significantly different. It is a standard and safe assumption in such problems that they will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Separation on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Key principle:** A chiral column can distinguish between all unique stereoisomers (both enantiomers and diastereomers), assuming the column is suitable for the compounds.\n*   We simply need to count the total number of unique stereoisomeric products formed.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have 2 unique diastereomers. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have 3 unique stereoisomers (the two enantiomers and the meso compound). A chiral column will resolve the enantiomers from each other, and both from the meso compound. This gives **3 peaks**.\n*   **Combined Mixture:** Again, we assume no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon C-5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n    *   The ketone at C-3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C-3.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter C-3: (R) or (S).\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C-5 remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have two stereocenters. The configuration is the same at one center (C-5) but different at the other (C-3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This is a symmetric and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product molecule has two stereocenters, at C-2 and C-4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n        *   Consider (2R, 4S). Due to the symmetry of the molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. This is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (you can see this by flipping the molecule over).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound ((2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the mixture on a normal-phase HPLC column\n\n*   **Total Compounds:** The final mixture contains the 5 stereoisomers produced in both reactions.\n*   **Separation Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they elute together and show a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving another **one peak**.\n    4.  The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They have different molecular weights, functional groups, and polarities, so they will not co-elute with each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks** in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the mixture on a chiral HPLC column\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). A CSP can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing them to be separated. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** A chiral column has the ability to resolve all stereochemically distinct compounds. Our mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically different, a chiral HPLC system can, in principle, separate all of them.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will now be resolved into two separate peaks (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is diastereomeric to the others and will be resolved as its own peak (**1 peak**).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks observed will be 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: The parent chain is hexane. There's a ketone (C=O) at position 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`. The chiral center at C5 is marked (S).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The ketone at carbon 3 is prochiral. Its reduction to an alcohol will create a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible stereoisomers for the new alcohol group at C3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`. This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric around C3. This means that (2R, 4S) is the same molecule as (2S, 4R). This specific stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) stereoisomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, any chiral products must be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. We have a total of 5 stereoisomers in the mixture:\n*   **From Rxn I:**\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **From Rxn II:**\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but **it cannot separate enantiomers**.\n*   **Separating Rxn I products:** Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Separating Rxn II products:**\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Combining the results:** The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols). They have different molecular formulas, sizes, and polarities, and will thus be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   The goal of chiral chromatography is to resolve all stereoisomers. We assume the column and conditions are suitable for this task.\n*   We have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   A chiral HPLC column can distinguish between all of these. Enantiomers (3 and 4) will be separated. Diastereomers (e.g., 1 vs 2, or 3 vs 5) will be separated. Constitutional isomers (the hexanols vs the diols) will be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Thus, we expect **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol. LAH is a strong, non-selective reducing agent.\n*   **Product:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to an alcohol (-OH group). The reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The starting material has one chiral center (C5). The reaction creates a new one (C3). The starting material is (5S).\n    *   The hydride attack on the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new C3 center: (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of two ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** Both ketone groups are reduced, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The product is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   We need to determine the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Since the molecule is symmetrical about C3, we need to check for meso compounds.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) because of the identical substituents on C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. (Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I, diastereomer of 1)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, enantiomer of 3)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Each HPLC Experiment\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties. It will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will all elute at different times.\n*   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Chiral HPLC can do everything a normal-phase column can do (separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers), but it can **also separate enantiomers**.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of five unique stereoisomers:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of the above) will give a separate **1 peak**.\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of the above) will now be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer (diastereomer of the others) and will have its own retention time, giving **1 peak**.\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at C-5, with the (S) configuration. This chiral center is not involved in the reaction and its configuration will be retained.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces.\n    *   This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Since the original chiral center at C-5 remains (S), the two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs 3S). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is an **achiral** molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, these must be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the CH₂ group, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC Separation**\n\nThe combined final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It can separate structural isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute), giving a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are enantiomers. They will co-elute and produce **1 peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will not co-elute with each other.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that interact differently with the stationary phase.\n*   It can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Therefore, each distinct stereoisomer in the mixture should produce a separate peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (diastereomer, separates)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4 (enantiomer, separates on chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (diastereomer, separates)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule is already chiral (due to C5), these two attacks lead to the formation of two different products.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The starting stereocenter at C5 remains (S). The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter the same (S at C5) and one different (R/S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        4.  **(2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. They will be formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture) because the starting material is achiral.\n    *   Let's look at the (2R, 4S) isomer. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through C3. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), which means it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)/(2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a second peak. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are different compounds with different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other. Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This produces **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers from each other. This will produce 2 peaks. The meso compound is a distinct, achiral stereoisomer and will elute as its own peak. Thus, the three stereoisomers from Reaction II will be fully resolved. This produces **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is the sum from each group.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC numbering starts from the right to give the ketone the lowest number (3). So the carbon chain is C1 to C6 from right to left: CH₃(1)-CH₂(2)-C(=O)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(OCH₃)(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   There is a stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This molecule is a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the existing stereocenter at C5.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is sp²-hybridized and prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter, the attack of the hydride is on a chiral molecule. This will lead to the formation of two products which are diastereomers. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with *excess* NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (in a certain conformation) and is therefore a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a **pair of enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers** have different connectivity and will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol and the enantiomeric pair of pentane-2,4-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers. Thus, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate from each other and will form a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    3.  **Comparing Products from I and II:** The products of Reaction I are 5-methoxyhexan-3-ols (C₇H₁₆O₂), while the products of Reaction II are pentane-2,4-diols (C₅H₁₂O₂). These are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas, sizes, and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** Adding the peaks from each separable group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that have different three-dimensional shapes.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It also separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   Assuming an ideal chiral column with sufficient resolving power, all stereochemically unique compounds will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct (either constitutional isomers, diastereomers, or enantiomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will be resolved into a separate peak. Therefore, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. This new center can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction will produce a mixture of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). The reaction is unlikely to be 100% diastereoselective, so both products will be formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones. Since it is in excess, both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Because the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The molecule is symmetric around C3. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral precursor with an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry (and is superimposable on its mirror image, the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers**.\n*   The combined mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    *   From Rxn I: (3R, 5S)-diol and (3S, 5S)-diol. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties, so they will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   From Rxn II: a racemic mixture and a meso compound. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties, so they will be separated. The racemic pair will elute together as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak. This gives **two peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2). They have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   The column will have different interactions with each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the separable species:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of 1, separable)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomer of 3, separable on a chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, diastereomer of 3 & 4, separable)\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution, the chiral column will resolve all five stereoisomers.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nThere is a possible alternative interpretation where the question assumes low resolution for diastereomers on a normal-phase column, leading to 2 peaks. However, this contradicts the \"high-performance\" nature of HPLC. The interpretation that leads to option D requires several inconsistent assumptions (e.g., ignoring the products of one reaction in the second analysis), making it chemically less plausible. The most rigorous and consistent analysis points to 4 peaks on the normal-phase column and 5 peaks on the chiral-phase column.\n\nLet's revisit the options and reasoning.\n- Normal-Phase (achiral):\n  - (3R,5S)-diol vs (3S,5S)-diol -> diastereomers, separate (Peak 1, Peak 2)\n  - (rac)-diol vs (meso)-diol -> diastereomers, separate (Peak 3, Peak 4)\n  - C7 compounds vs C5 compounds are very different -> no overlap expected.\n  - **Result: 4 peaks**\n- Chiral Phase:\n  - Separates everything above.\n  - Additionally, separates the racemic pair: (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol become two separate peaks.\n  - The 4 peaks from normal phase become 5: Peak 1, Peak 2, Peak 3a (RR), Peak 3b (SS), Peak 4 (meso).\n  - **Result: 5 peaks**\n\nFinal Answer: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\nFinal check of the question options against my conclusion.\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nMy conclusion matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has a ketone functional group at position 3 and a single chiral center at position 5 with a specific (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`. The chiral center is C5.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride anion (H-) from LAH can attack the prochiral carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). Since there are no directing groups to favor one side of attack over the other, both possibilities will occur.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can be either (R) or (S). The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction and remains (S).\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since one stereocenter is the same (C5 is S) and the other is different (C3 is R or S), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical diketone and is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since two chiral centers are formed (C2 and C4), we need to consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry in a certain conformation (it is identical to its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a **meso compound** and is achiral. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) designations describe the same single meso molecule.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The reduction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and their diastereomer, the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique that separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Separation rules:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will** be separated.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular formulas or connectivity (like the products of Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different properties and **will** be separated.\n*   **Counting the peaks:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The product mixture contains the (2R, 4R)/(2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different polarities. Therefore, their peaks will not overlap. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers and other structurally different molecules.\n*   **Separation rules:**\n    *   Enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and **will** be separated.\n    *   Diastereomers have different properties and **will** be separated.\n*   **Counting the peaks:** We need to count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** 2 distinct diastereomers were formed. These will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** 3 distinct stereoisomers were formed: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from each other, and it will also separate the meso diastereomer from the enantiomers. This gives **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 compounds in the mixture is chemically distinct and can be separated by an ideal chiral column. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    The chiral center is C5: -CH(OCH3)-.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces a ketone to an alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** The carbonyl group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The carbon at C3 is a prochiral center because it is planar (sp2 hybridized) and has three different groups attached. The hydride ion (H-) from LAH can attack this carbonyl carbon from two different faces (top or bottom). This attack creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The new chiral center at C3 can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. This leads to the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is opposite). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reagent (LAH) is achiral, a mixture of these two diastereomers will be formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" means both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** The two carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are both reduced to hydroxyl groups, creating two new chiral centers. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** With two new chiral centers (C2 and C4), up to 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers are possible: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    Let's analyze their relationships:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be produced in equal amounts (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has chiral centers, but because the molecule is symmetric (the substituents on C2 are the same as on C4), there is an internal plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule achiral overall. This is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are diastereomers of the meso compound. In total, Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (molecules with different connectivity), which the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Enantiomers will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the number of expected peaks for the combined mixture:\n1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n    These are diastereomers, so they will be separated into **two peaks**.\n3.  The racemic mixture of **(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II). As enantiomers, they will not be separated and will give **one peak**.\n4.  The **meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II).\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, it will be separated from them, giving another **one peak**.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is reasonable as they are constitutional isomers with different formulas and functional groups), the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each group of isomers.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all compounds that normal-phase HPLC can (constitutional isomers, diastereomers).\n*   Crucially, it **can also separate enantiomers**.\n\nLet's count the peaks based on the total number of unique stereoisomers produced:\n*   **From Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    These are two distinct compounds and will give **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    These are enantiomers and will be separated by the chiral column into **two peaks**.\n    5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    This is a distinct stereoisomer (a diastereomer of the others) and will give its own **one peak**.\n\nThe total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture is 5. A chiral HPLC, under ideal conditions, can separate all of them.\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from the enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from the meso of Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: The parent chain is hexan-3-one, which is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.\n    *   There is a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. So the structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has a stereocenter at carbon 5 (the carbon bonded to the methoxy group), and its configuration is specified as (S). This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. It will reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The ether linkage at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting material is chiral and enantiomerically pure (at C5), the reduction of the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two products.\n    *   The original stereocenter (5S) remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (because one center is the same (S) while the other is different (R vs S)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is a symmetric molecule and is **achiral**.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), 2. Acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The use of \"excess\" NaBH4 ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   This product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n        *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the central CH2 group. A molecule with stereocenters that is superimposable on its mirror image is called a **meso compound**. The mirror image of (2R, 4S) is (2S, 4R), and they are the same, identical molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the reduction of the achiral starting material produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Products in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as **one peak**.\n    *   Product 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of products 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the peak containing the enantiomers. This gives a **second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different and will have significantly different polarities and retention times. Thus, none of the peaks are expected to overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** Same 5 compounds as above.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. The chiral column will interact differently with each, leading to their separation into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   Product 5 (meso compound) is a diastereomer of the others and will also be separated, giving its own **third peak** from the Reaction II products.\n    *   Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different classes of molecules and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, and a chiral column is capable of separating all of them. Therefore, we will observe 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the problem to determine the number of peaks observed in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing stereocenter at carbon C5, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   The chiral center is C5: `-CH(OCH3)-`\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material has a stereocenter at C5 which is unaffected by the reaction, and a new stereocenter is formed at C3, the products will be diastereomers. The hydride attack on the prochiral ketone is not stereospecific, so it can attack from either face, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n    *   Product 1a: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 1b: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric diketone and is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** \"Excess\" NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom. This makes it a **meso compound**, which is achiral. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers [(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)] and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 3 and 4) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated. They elute together, giving a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like compounds 1 and 2; or the pair {3,4} and compound 5) have different physical properties and **will** be separated.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They have different molecular weights, functional groups, and polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   Products from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They will separate. **→ 2 peaks**\n*   Products from Reaction II:\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will elute together. **→ 1 peak**\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time. **→ 1 peak**\n    *   Total from Reaction II products = 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and different constitutional isomers.\n*   Since the chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers, each of the five unique compounds in the mixture will be resolved.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol **→ 1 peak**\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol **→ 1 peak**\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol **→ 1 peak**\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (separated from its enantiomer, #3) **→ 1 peak**\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, but is a unique molecule and diastereomer to the others) **→ 1 peak**\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at position 3 is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) can occur from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3. This new center can have either an (R) or an (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one chiral center (C5) but opposite configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers** of each other. Since the starting material is chiral, the reaction is diastereoselective, meaning the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical, achiral diketone.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃), has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)** and **(2S, 4S)** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)** is a **meso compound** because it is symmetrical and has a plane of symmetry, making it superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). So, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same achiral molecule.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent must result in an optically inactive product mixture.\n    1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    2.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    So, there are three distinct stereoisomers produced.\n\n**Step 3: Count the total number of unique stereoisomers produced.**\n*   From Reaction I: 2 diastereomers.\n*   From Reaction II: 1 pair of enantiomers (2 compounds) and 1 meso compound. Total of 3 stereoisomers.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will not be identical.\n*   Total number of unique stereoisomeric products = 2 + 3 = **5**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of peaks on the Chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between different stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the combined product mixture, an ideal chiral HPLC column will separate all of them.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of peaks on the Normal-Phase HPLC.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's analyze the product mixture:\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture) and a meso compound.\n        *   The two enantiomers, (2R, 4R)-diol and (2S, 4S)-diol, will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. So, the meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n        *   This gives **2 peaks** from Reaction II's products (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) and Reaction II (pentanediols) have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results and select the correct option.**\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   This corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n**Detailed Analysis and Reasoning**\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5. The configuration is specified as (S).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH is achiral and can attack the carbonyl group from either face (*re* face or *si* face).\n*   **Products:** This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already has a chiral center at C5, the two possible products will be diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct compounds (diastereomers) are formed. Let's call them **D1** and **D2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetrical beta-diketone (CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃) and is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** \"Excess\" NaBH₄ indicates that both ketone groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to secondary alcohols, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagents are all achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The product is pentane-2,4-diol (CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃).\n    *   Let's analyze the stereoisomers. With two chiral centers, there are a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical around C3.\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a racemic mixture. Let's call these **E1** and **E2**.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-CH₂ group. Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same meso compound. Let's call this **M**.\n    *   The meso compound (M) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers (E1 and E2).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the products and analyze with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Total Mixture:** The final mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    *   **D1** and **D2** (diastereomers from Reaction I)\n    *   **E1**, **E2** (enantiomers from Reaction II), and **M** (meso compound from Reaction II)\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC Separation Principle:** This technique uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like D1 and D2) have different physical properties and thus **are separated**.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **are not separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The **meso compound (M)** is a diastereomer of E1 and E2, so it has different physical properties and **will be separated** from the E1/E2 peak.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (pentane-2,4-diols) – they have different molecular weights, chain lengths, and functional groups. Therefore, the set of compounds from Reaction I will be separated from the set of compounds from Reaction II.\n*   **Counting the Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    1.  **Peak 1:** D1\n    2.  **Peak 2:** D2\n    3.  **Peak 3:** E1 and E2 (co-eluting enantiomeric pair)\n    4.  **Peak 4:** M (meso compound)\n*   **Total:** **4 peaks** will be observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Separation Principle:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP).

The stereocenter at C-5 is fixed in the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), followed by an acidic workup.\n        *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 will create a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, and the hydride ion can attack from either the *re* or *si* face.\n    *   **Products:** Since the starting material has one chiral center (C-5), and a new one is formed at C-3, the products will be diastereomers. The configuration at C-5 remains (S). The new center at C-3 can be either (R) or (S).\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n        *   The structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup.\n        *   NaBH₄ is a milder reducing agent than LAH, but it readily reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" implies both ketone groups will be reduced.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reduction of both carbonyl groups at C-2 and C-4 will form a diol, pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   **Stereochemistry of Products:** New chiral centers are formed at C-2 and C-4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the molecule, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same compound. This compound has a plane of symmetry passing through C-3 and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Mixture for HPLC:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n    *   Let's group the compounds based on how they will behave in normal-phase HPLC:\n        *   **Group A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   **Group B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. A and B are diastereomers and have different polarities. They will give two separate peaks.\n        *   **Group C:** The enantiomeric pair of {(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol}. They will co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   **Group D:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol. This is a diastereomer of the compounds in Group C, so it has a different polarity and will elute as a separate peak.\n    *   Furthermore, the compounds from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the compounds from Reaction II (diols). They have different molecular formulas (C₇H₁₆O₂ vs C₅H₁₂O₂) and polarities. Thus, it's certain that the peaks from Reaction I products will not co-elute with peaks from Reaction II products.\n    *   Therefore, we will observe four distinct peaks corresponding to Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D.\n    *   **Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4.**\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n    *   A chiral column can distinguish between all stereoisomers, provided they are not identical.\n    *   Our mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n    *   Each of these five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and, assuming sufficient column resolution, will elute at a different time.\n    *   **Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂(C=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's number the carbon chain starting from the right to give the methoxy group the lowest number as per its name origin, though IUPAC would prefer numbering from the left to give the ketone a lower number (2-methoxyhexan-4-one). However, let's stick to the name provided: the carbonyl is at C3 and the methoxy is at C5. Structure: CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral because of the stereocenter at C5, which is given in the (S) configuration. It is an enantiomerically pure starting material.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    *   This reaction creates a *new* stereocenter at C3. The carbonyl carbon is planar (sp² hybridized), and the hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule already contains a stereocenter (at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally likely from both sides, leading to an unequal mixture of diastereomers. However, *both* possible diastereomers will be formed, as these reactions are rarely 100% diastereoselective.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two stereocenters, at C3 and C5.\n    *   Since the stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The two products are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-(C=O)-CH₂-(C=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" means both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   We need to consider all possible stereoisomers. With 2 stereocenters, there is a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers.\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Let's check for relationships:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed as a 1:1 mixture (a racemic mixture).\n        *   Now consider (2R, 4S). If we look at this molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-CH₂ group. This makes it an achiral **meso compound**. Its mirror image, (2S, 4R), is superimposable on the original (2R, 4S) molecule. So, they are the same compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: the racemic pair of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), and the meso compound (2R, 4S).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Products with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will not separate and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a second peak.\n    *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products of Reaction I (C₇ alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally very different and will not co-elute by chance.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Products with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   An HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is a **chiral** separation technique.\n*   **Key principle:** A chiral column can separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can resolve all different stereoisomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). They are both chiral and different compounds, so they will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S), will be separated by the chiral column. This gives 2 distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral, but it is a distinct stereoisomer and will be separated from the other two compounds. This gives a third peak.\n    *   This gives a total of **3 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Again, assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of the two different reactions.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option that states \"5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\".\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position. The '(S)' designation indicates it is a single, pure enantiomer.\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n    CH3-CH2-C-CH2-CH(S)-CH3\n                    |\n                   OCH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from either the front face or the back face, both possible configurations at C3 will be formed.\n*   **Products:** The reaction starts with a molecule having the (S) configuration at C5 and generates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not enantiomers are called **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n      O     O\n      \\\\   //\n    CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is also a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" ensures that both ketone groups are reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl (-OH) groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    ```\n      OH    OH\n      |     |\n    CH3-CH-CH2-CH-CH3\n    ```\n*   **Products:** Since two chiral centers are formed, we must consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4 (through the central CH2 group).\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are mirror images of each other and are not superimposable. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, these enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) configuration is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This is because of the internal plane of symmetry. A molecule with chiral centers that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S) or (2S, 4R))\n    The enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) are diastereomers of the meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n*   **From Rxn I:** Two diastereomers.\n*   **From Rxn II:** A pair of enantiomers and one meso compound (a total of three stereoisomers).\n\nNow let's consider the two HPLC methods:\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products of Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated from each other. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, so it will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n4.  The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are completely different molecules (constitutional isomers), ensuring they elute at different times.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate all different stereoisomers (constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers), assuming ideal resolution.\n\nLet's count the peaks by counting every unique molecule in the mixture:\n*   From Reaction I:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 1**)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 2**)\n*   From Reaction II:\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 3**)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 4**, separated from its enantiomer)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 5**)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
