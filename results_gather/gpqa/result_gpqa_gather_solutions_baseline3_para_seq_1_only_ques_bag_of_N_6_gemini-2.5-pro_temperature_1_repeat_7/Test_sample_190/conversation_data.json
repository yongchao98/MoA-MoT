A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n2.  A primary alcohol in a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n3.  An alkene in a prop-1-en-2-yl (isopropenyl) group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Process:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) rather than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   The resulting alkoxide ion (-CH2O⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OH → -CH2OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH2Ph). This step serves to protect the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Process:** This is the standard formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group is converted into a tosylhydrazone (C=O → C=N-NHTs, where Ts = tosyl, -SO2-C6H4-CH3).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base. Aqueous NH4Cl is a mild proton source for quenching.\n*   **Process:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton, and the second deprotonates an α-carbon. The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with aqueous NH4Cl, which protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone functionality is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively eliminating the original ketone. C=N-NHTs → C=C. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (The exact position of the new double bond doesn't alter the constitution of the final product).\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Process:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both C=C double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzyl group and the oxygen is broken.\n        *   -CH2-O-Bn → -CH2-OH (+ toluene as a byproduct).\n*   **Transformation:** All unsaturations are removed, and the alcohol is deprotected. The cyclohexane ring skeleton is restored, now with an isopropyl group at position 5 and a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. The relative 1,3-positioning of these substituents is maintained throughout the sequence.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our final structure with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl group should be gone, and the ketone is eliminated, not converted to a butyl alcohol.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is the protected alcohol. The benzyl ether should be cleaved by hydrogenolysis.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is removed in step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This name accurately describes the final product with a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first visualize the starting material. It is a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups:\n*   A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\nThe two substituents (-CH2OH and isopropenyl) are in a 1,3-relationship (meta) to each other on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the primary alcohol (-CH2OH), forming a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide is a good nucleophile.\n*   The alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyl ether group (-CH2-O-CH2-C6H5, abbreviated as -CH2OBn). This step serves to protect the alcohol group from subsequent reactions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazine derivative in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium is a very strong base. This reaction is performed at low temperature, followed by an aqueous quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base. The first equivalent deprotonates the sulfonamide nitrogen (-NHTs). The second equivalent deprotonates a carbon alpha to the C=N bond (an α-proton). The reaction generally proceeds via deprotonation of the less sterically hindered α-proton. In our molecule, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. Both are adjacent to substituted carbons (C3 and C5, respectively), but the reaction proceeds regardless of which is deprotonated. The resulting dianion intermediate then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium species.\n*   The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond, with the double bond forming at the less substituted position. The ketone at C1 is effectively removed and replaced by a C=C bond. For instance, if the proton at C6 is removed, a double bond forms between C1 and C6. The substituents at C3 and C5 are unaffected, and their 1,3-relationship is maintained.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This set of reagents is used to reduce carbon-carbon double bonds and also to perform hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n        *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (-CH₂-O-Bn) is cleaved. The benzyloxy group is converted back to a hydroxyl group, and the benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are an isopropyl group (from the original C5) and a hydroxymethyl group (from the original C3). Their relative 1,3-relationship is preserved. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Naming the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, with a 1,3-relationship. Naming this compound where the -CH2OH group is part of the parent name gives (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name correctly describes the final product we derived.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This would be an intermediate if the Shapiro reaction (step 3) was skipped and only hydrogenation was performed on product 2. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from several incorrect reaction pathways, including nucleophilic addition of butylithium and failure of hydrogenolysis. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated in step 4, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as Pd/C with H₂ also causes hydrogenolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's visualize the structure. It is a six-membered ring with a ketone (C=O) at position 1. At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr or C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The most acidic proton in the starting material is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the hydroxymethyl side chain (pKa ≈ 16-18), which is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a potent nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis). This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH2C6H5). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a reagent used to convert carbonyl compounds into tosylhydrazones. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group (C=O) at position C1 reacts with the terminal amino group (-NH2) of the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. This is a condensation reaction that, after dehydration, forms a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of Product 1**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base. Aqueous NH4Cl is a mild proton source for quenching the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of conditions corresponds to the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond, i.e., at C2 or C6). This deprotonation typically occurs at the less sterically hindered position.\n    3.  The resulting dianion spontaneously collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and a p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  This intermediate is then protonated by the addition of aqueous NH4Cl.\n*   **Result:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone group with a C=C double bond. The ketone is effectively deoxygenated and reduced to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone is removed, and a double bond is formed in the ring, adjacent to the position of the former ketone. The structure is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (assuming the double bond forms between C1 and C6, though the exact position does not affect the final product's constitution). The key features are the cyclohexene ring, the isopropenyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl protecting group.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** H2 gas with a Palladium on Carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several types of reductions:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n    2.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The double bond of the isopropenyl side chain (-C(CH3)=CH2) will be reduced to a single bond, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken by hydrogen, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH2OH) and producing toluene (C6H5CH3) as a byproduct. This is a standard deprotection method for benzyl ethers.\n*   **Product 4:** All reducible groups in Product 3 are reduced.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their relative 1,3-positioning is maintained throughout the synthesis. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis with H2/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure suggests a nucleophilic attack by n-BuLi on the ketone, which is incorrect for the Shapiro reaction sequence.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone intermediate, not the final product after the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product, where all double bonds have been hydrogenated and the benzyl protecting group has been removed via hydrogenolysis.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction of the starting material with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n        *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr or PhCH₂Br):** This is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The ketone and the alkene remain unchanged.\n    *   The structure of product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Under acidic conditions (catalytic HCl), ketones react with hydrazine derivatives like tosylhydrazide to form hydrazones. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and the two hydrogen atoms from the -NH₂ group of the hydrazide are eliminated as water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group is converted to a tosylhydrazone (-C=NNHTs). The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   The structure of product 2 is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** This is a very strong base.\n    2.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl):** This is a mild proton source for the workup step.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi). The base first deprotonates the nitrogen of the hydrazone (N-H) and then a carbon atom alpha to the C=N double bond.\n    *   The resulting dianion intermediate is unstable and collapses, eliminating a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate). This forms a vinyllithium species.\n    *   The aqueous NH₄Cl workup quenches the vinyllithium, protonating it to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall transformation of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, with the double bond located where the carbonyl group was. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain intact.\n    *   The structure of product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. (Note: the exact position of the newly formed double bond in the ring is not critical as it will be removed in the next step).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two alkene groups (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Pd/C with H₂ will reduce both carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** These conditions are also standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (R-O-CH₂Ph) is broken, and the group is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Toluene is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is saturated to cyclohexane.\n    *   The isopropenyl group is saturated to isopropyl.\n    *   The benzyl ether is cleaved back to the original primary alcohol.\n    *   The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group. The relative 1,3-positions of these two groups on the ring are maintained from the starting material.\n*   **Final Structure:** The resulting structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compare this final structure with the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This molecule still contains the benzyl ether group. Incorrect.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure results from an incorrect reaction pathway (e.g., nucleophilic addition of BuLi). Incorrect.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This molecule still contains the tosylhydrazone moiety. Incorrect.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This name correctly describes the final product: a methanol group (-CH₂OH) attached to a cyclohexane ring which is substituted with an isopropyl group at the 3-position relative to the methanol group. This matches our derived structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH₂Ph).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also known as tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone reacts with the hydrazide under acidic catalysis to form a C=N bond with the elimination of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. In a typical Shapiro reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. However, looking at the final options, they are all based on a cyclohexane ring, not a cyclohexene ring. This implies that the reaction conditions led to the complete reduction of the original ketone position to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a known outcome for the reaction of tosylhydrazones, often referred to as a modified Wolff-Kishner reduction or a Bamford-Stevens reaction under specific conditions. We will proceed with this interpretation, as it is the only one that leads to one of the given answer choices.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is replaced by two hydrogen atoms. The C=O is effectively reduced to CH₂. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and the alkene) are unaffected by these reagents.\n*   **Product 3:** The starting material had substituents at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (hydroxymethyl), and 5 (isopropenyl). After this step, C1 is now a -CH₂- group. The ring is a cyclohexane with a (benzyloxy)methyl group and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at positions that are 1,3 to each other. The structure is 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexane).\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, which can reduce alkenes and also cause hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of the alkene:** The double bond in the prop-1-en-2-yl group is reduced (hydrogenated) to a single bond, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), and toluene (PhCH₃) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   -CH₂(C(CH₃)=CH₂) → -CH(CH(CH₃)₂)\n    *   -CH₂OBn → -CH₂OH\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group at positions 1 and 3. The IUPAC name for this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived final product with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The reaction pathway is wrong.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone should have reacted in step 3.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in step 4. However, H₂/Pd/C is a standard reagent for benzyl ether cleavage (hydrogenolysis), so this is an incomplete reaction.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The acidity order is alcohol-OH (pKa ≈ 16-18) > ketone α-protons (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl substituent.\n    -CH₂OH + NaH → -CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It then reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, an Sₙ2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n    -CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → -CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected. The structure of product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also known as tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** Aldehydes and ketones react with tosylhydrazide to form tosylhydrazones. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and the two hydrogen atoms from the -NH₂ group of the hydrazide are eliminated as a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at the C-1 position of the cyclohexanone ring is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=NNHTs). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of conditions is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    1.  Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on one of the α-carbons (C-2 or C-6). Under kinetic control (low temperature), the base removes a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is C-6 (C-2 is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C-3).\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. A double bond is formed between the original C-1 and C-6 positions, with the lithium atom at C-1.\n    4.  The reaction is quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium, replacing the lithium with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond at the less substituted position. A double bond forms between C-1 and C-6 of the original ring. The substituents at C-3 and C-5 remain, maintaining their 1,3-relationship. The structure of product 3 is an alkene, specifically a cyclohexene derivative like 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (numbering depends on the convention, but the connectivity is what matters).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also causes the hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n    1.  **Reduction of alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be saturated with hydrogen.\n        - Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n        - Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken.\n        - Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH] + Toluene [PhCH₃]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a cyclohexane skeleton. The substituent at the original C-3 position is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), and the substituent at the original C-5 position is an isopropyl group. These two groups are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane. It can be named as 1-(hydroxymethyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane or, by treating the cyclohexane ring as a substituent on methanol, as (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This perfectly matches our derived structure.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl group would be removed, and the addition of a butyl group is not characteristic of a Shapiro reaction quench with a proton source.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone moiety is eliminated during the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard hydrogenation with Pd/C is expected to cause this cleavage (hydrogenolysis).\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol proton (pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis). This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph). The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unchanged. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl), reacts with ketones to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. Two equivalents of strong base (like n-BuLi) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone, and the second deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon. This dianion then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup (NH4Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene.\n*   **Result:** The ketone functionality at C1 is effectively removed and replaced with a double bond between C1 and one of its adjacent carbons (C2 or C6). The regioselectivity is not critical for the final structure, as this double bond will be reduced in the next step.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group remain intact.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation system.\n*   **Reactions:**\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds.\n        *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The Pd/C catalyst also cleaves the benzyl ether C-O bond. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene (PhCH3) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring becomes fully saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl substituent becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The (benzyloxy)methyl substituent becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These substituents retain their 1,3-relationship from the starting material. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product before the final hydrogenolysis step. The benzyl ether is still present.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure would result from an incorrect reaction pathway (nucleophilic addition of n-BuLi).\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This perfectly matches the structure deduced from the reaction sequence. It is a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2OH group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone intermediate, not the final product of the four-step sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagent 1 (NaH):** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂(g)\n*   **Reagent 2 (Benzyl Bromide, BnBr):** The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreacted.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-Toluenesulfonyl Hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl), reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous Ammonium Chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with a strong base (at least two equivalents of n-BuLi) at low temperature.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbon of the original ketone). There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation at the less substituted carbon (C6) is kinetically favored, especially at low temperatures.\n    3.  This dianion then collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The final workup with aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium, protonating it to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The Shapiro reaction effectively reduces a ketone to an alkene, with the double bond forming at the less substituted position under kinetic control.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=N-NHTs group at C1 is replaced by a C=C double bond between C1 and C6.

In this molecule, the proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is the most acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18). NaH removes this proton to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br):** An alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Williamson ether synthesis**. The nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. The result is the formation of a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2):** Also known as tosylhydrazide.\n    *   **HCl (catalytic):** An acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with tosylhydrazide to form a **tosylhydrazone**. This is a condensation reaction where the carbonyl oxygen and two hydrogens from the -NH2 group of the hydrazide are eliminated as a water molecule (H2O), forming a C=N double bond. The acid catalyst facilitates the reaction by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.\n*   **Product 2:** The C=O group of the ketone is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.

The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on the carbon atom alpha to the C=N bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl):** A mild proton source used to quench the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**. The dianion formed by the action of n-BuLi is unstable and eliminates p-toluenesulfinate (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous NH4Cl protonates the vinyllithium to give an alkene. The net result of this reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, effectively removing the oxygen atom. The double bond typically forms at the less substituted position (kinetic control), which is favored by low temperatures.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group is now gone, replaced by a C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring. The benzyloxy and isopropenyl groups are unchanged.

This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of C=C double bonds:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced (saturated) with hydrogen. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene (C6H5CH3) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl substituent becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The (benzyloxy)methyl substituent becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton of the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH, pKa ≈ 16-17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr, PhCH₂Br):** This is an electrophile. The nucleophilic alkoxide formed in the first step attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.

The ketone group reacts with the hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (commonly called a tosylhydrazone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (a very strong base) followed by an aqueous quench.\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for a **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone, via its tosylhydrazone, into an alkene. The mechanism involves the removal of two protons by the strong base, followed by the elimination of p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup (aq. NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to yield the final alkene. The Shapiro reaction regioselectively forms the less substituted alkene (i.e., the double bond forms between the former carbonyl carbon and the less sterically hindered adjacent α-carbon).\n*   **Analysis:** The original ketone was at C1. The adjacent α-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is adjacent to the bulky -CH₂OBn group at C3, while C6 is unsubstituted. Therefore, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*(Note: An alternative reaction, the Wolff-Kishner reduction, would reduce the ketone to a CH₂ group. While the reagents are more typical for a Shapiro reaction, a Wolff-Kishner type reduction would ultimately lead to the same final product after Step 4.)*\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation**. This process is highly effective at:\n    1.  **Reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds:**\n        *   The cyclohexene double bond (C1=C6) will be reduced to a single bond, saturating the ring to cyclohexane.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) will be reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Cleaving benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis:**\n        *   The benzyloxy group (-O-CH₂Ph) will be cleaved at the C-O bond, and the oxygen will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The benzyl group becomes toluene. So, the -CH₂OCH₂Ph group becomes a -CH₂OH group.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the starting cyclohexane ring is modified as follows:\n    *   The ketone at C1 has been removed (it became part of an alkene in Step 3, which was then saturated in Step 4).\n    *   The hydroxymethyl group at C3, which was protected as a benzyl ether, is deprotected back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The isopropenyl group at C5 is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The chemical name for this molecule is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved. This is incorrect as H₂/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from an incorrect assumption about the reaction in Step 3 (nucleophilic addition of butyl group).\n*   C) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This structure matches our derived final product.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure is inconsistent with the reactions in steps 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **BnBr:** Benzyl bromide is an electrophilic alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide. The nitrogen of the -NH₂ group in TsNHNH₂ attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated. The acid (HCl) catalyzes this condensation reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base like n-BuLi.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The base preferentially removes the proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the carbon at position 6 is less hindered than the carbon at position 2 (which is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    3.  The resulting intermediate dianion eliminates p-toluenesulfinate (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The aqueous NH₄Cl workup provides a proton source to quench the vinyllithium, forming an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=O group of the original ketone is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted α-carbon (C6).\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene). This molecule contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is very effective for several transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** H₂/Pd-C also cleaves benzyl ethers (R-O-CH₂Ph) at the C-O bond, reducing them to an alcohol (R-OH) and toluene (PhCH₃). The benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] becomes a hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH].\n*   **Product 4:** All reducible groups are reduced. The cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane, the isopropenyl group becomes isopropyl, and the benzyl ether becomes an alcohol. The relative 1,3-positions of the two substituents on the ring are preserved. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy following the reaction sequence, the final product is determined to be (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Comparing this with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.**\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step did not occur.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   At position 1, there is a ketone (C=O).\n    *   At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n    *   The molecule has three reactive sites: a primary alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    *   NaH deprotonates the -CH₂OH group to form a sodium alkoxide, -CH₂O⁻Na⁺.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr), an electrophile, in an Sₙ2 reaction known as the Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-CH₂-O-CH₂-Ph, abbreviated as -CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and alkene groups are unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone.\n    *   The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) condenses with the primary amine of the hydrazide (-NH₂) to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Treatment of Product 2 at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   This is a Shapiro reaction. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    *   n-BuLi, a very strong base, is used in excess (typically >2 equivalents). It first deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone, and then a proton on a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    *   Deprotonation of the α-carbon is regioselective. The base will preferentially remove a proton from the less sterically hindered α-position. The α-carbons are C2 and C6. The substituent at C3 (-CH₂OBn) is generally bulkier than the substituent at C5 (-isopropenyl). Therefore, deprotonation is more likely to occur at C6.\n    *   The resulting intermediate eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as a sulfinate salt) to form a vinyllithium species, with the new double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The final addition of aqueous NH₄Cl serves as a proton source to quench the vinyllithium, replacing the lithium with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene is formed where the ketone used to be. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unchanged. The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene derivative with two C=C double bonds: one in the ring and one in the side chain. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the fourth reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for reducing several types of functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be hydrogenated to C-C single bonds.\n        *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a deprotection reaction). The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is cleaved.\n        *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The other product is toluene (PhCH₃), which is not part of the main structure.\n    *   This sequence (protection as a benzyl ether, reaction, and deprotection via hydrogenation) is a common strategy in organic synthesis. It is highly probable that all possible reductions occur.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has:\n    *   A cyclohexane ring.\n    *   An isopropyl group.\n    *   A hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The substituents are on the ring in a 1,3-relationship (derived from the original 3- and 5-positions of the cyclohexanone). The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is still present, meaning the Shapiro reaction (step 3) did not complete.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This name corresponds to 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is a less likely outcome under the given conditions.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The addition of a butyl group is inconsistent with a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (the isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    \n    R-CH₂OH + NaH → R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    \n    The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile. It then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis, which is an S_N2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion. This process \"protects\" the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreactive under these conditions.\n    \n    R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph (a benzyl ether, ROBn) + NaBr\n    \n*   **Product 1:** The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst activates the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.\n    \n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs --(H⁺)--> R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O\n    \n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. The mechanism involves the use of at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi):\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the α-proton on the less sterically hindered carbon adjacent to the C=N bond. In this case, the original ketone was at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less substituted (it has two protons), so deprotonation occurs there.\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (p-toluenesulfinate anion, Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The final step is quenching the reaction with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at C1 has been converted to a C=C double bond between C1 and C6. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reducing condition has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule will be reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated with hydrogen.\n        - The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n        - The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl protecting group is cleaved under these conditions. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and the oxygen is replaced with a hydrogen atom, regenerating the primary alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        - The benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂OBn] becomes a hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH].\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their relative 1,3-positions on the ring are maintained throughout the synthesis.

The Shapiro reaction does not add a butyl group, and the benzyl ether is cleaved.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. H₂/Pd-C is known to cause this cleavage (hydrogenolysis).\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's analyze the structure:\n*   A six-membered ring (cyclohexane).\n*   A ketone group (=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The most acidic proton in the starting material is on the hydroxyl group of the -CH2OH substituent. NaH deprotonates this alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide is a potent nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The -OH group is now an -OCH2Ph group (often abbreviated as -OBn).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) is a derivative of hydrazine. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction converts a ketone into a tosylhydrazone. The lone pair on the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon (activated by protonation from HCl). This is followed by a dehydration step to form a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at C1 is replaced by a tosylhydrazone group (=N-NHTs).\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a mild proton source for the workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is the Shapiro reaction. It converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NHTs group. The second equivalent deprotonates one of the alpha-carbons (C2 or C6). Deprotonation at the less sterically hindered C6 position is generally favored.\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and spontaneously eliminates molecular nitrogen (N2) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate, where a C=C double bond has formed between C1 and C6, and the lithium is attached to C1.\n    3.  The aqueous NH4Cl workup quenches the vinyllithium, replacing the lithium atom with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone/tosylhydrazone at C1 is removed and replaced with a double bond. The ring becomes a cyclohexene. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a hydrogenation catalyst, and H2 is the source of hydrogen.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This set of reagents is very effective at reducing carbon-carbon double bonds and also causes hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n    1.  **Reduction of C=C bonds:** The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane. The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is also reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the benzyl group becomes toluene (which is removed during workup). So, the -CH2OCH2Ph group becomes a -CH2OH group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2). These substituents are in a 1,3 relationship on the ring.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This retains the tosylhydrazone group.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches our derived final product.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This retains the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by H2/Pd-C.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from an incorrect reaction pathway (nucleophilic addition of butyl group).\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's analyze its structure:\n*   A six-membered ring (cyclohexane).\n*   A ketone group (=O) at position C1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position C3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position C5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed is a good nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n3.  **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group from the strongly basic reagent in a later step.\n    The structure of **Product 1** is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n1.  This reaction involves the condensation of a ketone (Product 1) with a hydrazide derivative (p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, also called tosylhydrazide).\n2.  The nitrogen atom of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and subsequent dehydration (catalyzed by the acid, HCl) leads to the formation of a **tosylhydrazone**.\n3.  **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is replaced by a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n    The structure of **Product 2** is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n1.  This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi, typically 2 equivalents).\n2.  The base first deprotonates the N-H proton, then a second proton from the carbon alpha to the C=N bond (at C2 or C6). Deprotonation usually occurs at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon.\n3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n4.  The final workup with aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene.\n5.  **Product 3:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively deoxygenating the ketone. The double bond will be located between the original C1 and one of its alpha-neighbors (C2 or C6). The other substituents remain. So, product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether group and an isopropenyl group. For instance, **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. The exact position of the double bond (C1=C2 or C1=C6) does not affect the final structure's connectivity after the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing several types of functional groups with H₂ gas.\n2.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated).\n    *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) → Isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is also very effective at cleaving benzyl ethers. This reaction, called hydrogenolysis, breaks the C-O bond of the ether, converting the protected alcohol back into a free alcohol.\n    *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) (plus toluene as a byproduct).\n4.  **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get the final structure. The cyclohexane ring now has a hydroxymethyl group at the original C3 position and an isopropyl group at the original C5 position. The ketone at C1 has been completely removed.\n\n**Final Structure Analysis:**\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a -CH2OH group and a -CH(CH3)2 group. The relative positions of these two groups are 1,3 (counting from C3 to C4 to C5). Let's name this molecule based on IUPAC rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the parent name is based on methanol. The substituent is the rest of the molecule attached to the methanol carbon. Numbering the cyclohexane ring starting from the carbon atom attached to the -CH2OH group as C1', the isopropyl group is located at C3'. Thus, the substituent is a (3'-isopropylcyclohexyl) group.\nThe name of the final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, an intermediate, not the final product.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is unlikely under the given conditions.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This perfectly matches the structure we derived.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This results from an alternative, less likely reaction pathway of n-BuLi and doesn't account for the final deprotection step.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the starting molecule. It is a cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone). Let's number the carbon of the ketone as C1. At position C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3 (or meta) relationship to each other.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Role of NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The starting material has acidic protons on the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and at the α-carbons to the ketone (C2 and C6, pKa ≈ 19-21). The hydroxyl proton is significantly more acidic. Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide, -CH2O⁻Na⁺.\n*   **Role of BnBr:** Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis).\n*   **Product 1:** The -OH group is converted into a benzyl ether (-OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH2Ph). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.*\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl**\n*   This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone group (C=O) at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (or simply, a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Product 2:** The C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group (where Ts = tosyl, p-toluenesulfonyl).\n    *Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1.*\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n*   This is a **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second, being a strong base, deprotonates an α-carbon (C2 or C6). Deprotonation usually occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon (C6 in this case), leading to the kinetic product. This is followed by the elimination of the tosylate anion and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Quench:** The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a mild proton source, which protonates the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The C=N-NHTs group is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond, where the double bond is formed between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is an alkene. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are still attached to the ring at their original positions (C3 and C5 of the original numbering scheme). The 1,3-relationship between them is maintained.\n    *Product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.*\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for this process.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to C-C single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H2 is also effective at cleaving benzyl ethers (O-Bn). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, and the group is reduced to an alcohol (-OH). The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n*   **Product 4:** Applying these changes to Product 3:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The `3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)` group becomes a `3-isopropyl` group.\n    *   The `5-((benzyloxy)methyl)` group becomes a `5-(hydroxymethyl)` group.\n*   The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between the substituent attachment points (C3 and C5 on the original ring) is preserved.\n\n**Naming Product 4 and Conclusion:**\nThe structure is a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane, where the substituents are isopropyl and hydroxymethyl.\nLet's consider the IUPAC name. If we treat the hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) part as the principal functional group, the molecule is a substituted methanol. The parent alcohol is cyclohexylmethanol. The substituents on the cyclohexane ring are named and numbered, starting from the carbon attached to the -CH2OH group as C1. The isopropyl group is at C3.\nTherefore, the name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is a hydrazide, not the final product.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final structure.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis occurs under these conditions.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction sequence.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's draw the structure. It is a cyclohexanone ring with three substituents.\n*   A ketone group `(C=O)` at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group `(-CH2OH)` at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group `(-C(CH3)=CH2)` at position 5.\nThe numbering places the ketone at C1, and we number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The two types of acidic protons are the alcoholic proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (at C2 and C6, pKa ≈ 19-21). The alcohol proton is more acidic and will be deprotonated by NaH to form a sodium alkoxide `(-CH2O- Na+)`.\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br or BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n3.  The `(-CH2OH)` group is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group `(-CH2OCH2C6H5` or `-CH2OBn)`.\n\n**Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl**\n1.  This is the reaction of a ketone with a hydrazine derivative to form a **hydrazone**.\n2.  The ketone at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a **tosylhydrazone**. The nitrogen of the `-NH2` group attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n3.  The ketone `(C=O)` is converted to a tosylhydrazone group `(C=N-NHTs)`.\n\n**Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n1.  This is a **Shapiro reaction**. It converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene.\n2.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the original carbonyl carbon).\n3.  There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6. C2 is adjacent to the bulky `-CH2OBn` group at C3, making it sterically hindered. C6 is less hindered. At low temperatures, the reaction is under kinetic control, and the base will deprotonate the less sterically hindered proton at **C6**.\n4.  The resulting dianion eliminates the tosyl group and a molecule of nitrogen gas (N2), a very stable leaving group, to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between C1 and the deprotonated α-carbon, C6.\n5.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)** is a mild proton source that quenches the vinyllithium intermediate to form the final alkene product.\n\n**Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (Numbered according to IUPAC rules for the cyclohexene product, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a standard catalyst for this process.\n2.  Catalytic hydrogenation reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the isopropenyl group `(-C(CH3)=CH2)` will be reduced to form an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH3)2)`.\n3.  Critically, H2/Pd-C is also the standard reagent for the **hydrogenolysis** of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether `(-O-CH2Ph)` is cleaved, and the alcohol is regenerated. The benzyl group becomes toluene `(CH3Ph)`.\n4.  Therefore, the `(-CH2OBn)` group is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group `(-CH2OH)`.\n\n**Final Product 4:**\n*   The carbon skeleton is a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The substituents are an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   The relative positions of the substituents are preserved from the starting material (they were at C3 and C5, which is a 1,3-relationship). So, we have a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n*   The structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: This matches our derived final structure.\nB) **(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is less likely under standard hydrogenation conditions.\nC) **N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**: This is an incorrect structure that retains the tosylhydrazide group.\nD) **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This structure results from an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n\nThe most chemically sound pathway leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three key functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups remain unchanged.\n    *   The structure of **Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the amino group of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is replaced by a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   The structure of **Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) workup.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions are characteristic of the Shapiro reaction, which can be used for either elimination to form an alkene or, as in this case, reduction of the original carbonyl group to a methylene (CH2) group.\n    1.  Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice: once at the nitrogen (N-H) and once at the carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    2.  This intermediate dianion then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  However, a common and important variant of this reaction, often simply called a Shapiro reduction, involves quenching the intermediate (or the final vinyllithium) with a proton source like water or aqueous NH4Cl. This results in the net reduction of the ketone's carbonyl group to a methylene group (C=O → CH2). This is an effective alternative to the Wolff-Kishner or Clemmensen reductions, especially for base-sensitive substrates.\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone group is completely removed and replaced by a CH2 group. The cyclohexanone ring becomes a simple cyclohexane ring. The substituents, the (benzyloxy)methyl group and the isopropenyl group, are now on a saturated cyclohexane ring in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   The structure of **Product 3** is 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexane (or an isomer with the same connectivity).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of the Alkene:** The carbon-carbon double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) will be reduced (saturated) to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** Benzyl ethers are readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, and hydrogen is added. The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH2OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and the benzyl group becomes toluene (which is removed during workup).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The structure of **Product 4** is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our deduced structure for Product 4 with the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure perfectly.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if only the alkene were reduced and the benzyl ether remained intact.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure implies the tosylhydrazone was not consumed in step 3.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure results from several incorrect assumptions about the reactions, including nucleophilic addition of the butyl group.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, an alcohol (in the hydroxymethyl group), and an alkene (in the isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. Comparing the acidity of the alcohol's proton (-CH2OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and the alpha-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20), the alcohol proton is significantly more acidic. Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻ Na⁺) is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an excellent electrophile for SN2 reactions.\n    *   The alkoxide will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene functionalities remain unchanged.\n    *   The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   Ketones react with hydrazines (like p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide) under acidic catalysis to form hydrazones. In this case, a tosylhydrazone is formed.\n    *   The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   The structure of Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   The reaction of a tosylhydrazone with two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base like n-BuLi is known as the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The n-BuLi first deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone, and then a second equivalent deprotonates a proton on the carbon atom alpha to the C=N bond (either C2 or C6).\n    *   This is followed by the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The final addition of aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium intermediate to yield an alkene.\n    *   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, effectively replacing the C=O group with a C=C double bond. The new double bond will be located between the former carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent alpha-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene is formed. Regardless of whether the new double bond is at C1-C2 or C1-C6, the product is a cyclohexene derivative containing the original isopropenyl double bond and the benzyl ether group.\n    *   The structure of Product 3 is an isomer of **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n    *   *Alternative Consideration:* In some cases, tosylhydrazones can be reduced to alkanes (C=O → CH₂). Even if this alternative pathway occurred, the final product after Step 4 would be the same, as the key transformations in Step 4 are independent of the double bond in the ring.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a powerful method for reducing multiple types of functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds will be reduced to single bonds. This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will both be saturated.\n        *   cyclohex-1-ene → cyclohexane\n        *   prop-1-en-2-yl (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) → isopropyl (-CH(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** H₂/Pd-C is also the standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and a C-H bond and an O-H bond are formed.\n        *   -CH₂-O-Bn → -CH₂-OH (plus toluene as a byproduct)\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the starting cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyloxy-methyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other.\n    *   This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure contains a butyl group and an intact benzyl ether, neither of which is consistent with the reaction sequence.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether, which would have been cleaved by hydrogenolysis in Step 4.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first understand the structure of the starting material. It is a cyclohexane ring with three functional groups:\n*   A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\nThe substituents at positions 3 and 5 are in a meta-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material has an acidic proton on the hydroxyl group (-OH) and alpha-protons next to the ketone. The alcohol proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the alpha-protons (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is used to convert aldehydes and ketones into tosylhydrazones. The reaction is typically acid-catalyzed.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group of product 1 reacts with the amino group of tosylhydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water to form a tosylhydrazone.\n    R₂C=O + H₂NNHTs → R₂C=NNHTs + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The structure is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** This is the set of reagents for a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen and replacing it with a C=C double bond.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are typically used. The first deprotonates the -NH- group, and the second deprotonates the alpha-carbon.\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  The vinyllithium is then protonated by a proton source (water from the aqueous NH₄Cl workup).\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is removed, and a double bond is formed in the ring (e.g., between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6). The cyclohexane ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl groups are unaffected. The product is a **cyclohexene with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group**, maintaining their 1,3-relationship on the ring. An example structure would be **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction will reduce all reducible groups in Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the isopropenyl group and the double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to single bonds.\n        - The isopropenyl group becomes an **isopropyl group**.\n        - The cyclohexene ring becomes a **cyclohexane ring**.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether C-O bond is cleaved by hydrogen, a reaction called hydrogenolysis. The benzyl group is removed as toluene, and the ether is converted back to an alcohol.\n        - The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a **hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH)**.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The original 1,3-relationship between these substituents is maintained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product, Product 4, has the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   An isopropyl group.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   The two substituents are in a 1,3 (meta) arrangement on the ring.\n\nThis structure corresponds to the name **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is removed in Step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Contains a butyl group (wrong reaction pathway) and a benzyl group (which should be removed).\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is a benzyl ether, which should have been cleaved to an alcohol by hydrogenolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's first establish the structure of the starting material. It is a cyclohexanone derivative with three functional groups: a ketone (at C1), a primary alcohol (in the hydroxymethyl group at C3), and an alkene (in the isopropenyl group at C5). The substituents on the ring at positions 3 and 5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (Bn-Br or PhCH₂Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. Comparing the alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) and the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20), the alcohol is more acidic. NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH₂OH + NaH → R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It will then react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (S_N2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. The alcohol is now \"protected\" as a benzyl ether.\n    R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph), while the ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide, TsNHNH₂) reacts with aldehydes and ketones.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic condensation reaction to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone at C1 reacts with the terminal amino group of the tosylhydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water. This reaction is catalyzed by acid (HCl).\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs → R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide. The ketone group is converted to a tosylhydrazone group.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by eliminating the entire hydrazone moiety. It requires two equivalents of a strong base.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates a proton on the α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the original ketone position). Deprotonation generally occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon to form the kinetic product. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less hindered than C2 (which is next to the C3 substituent). Thus, a proton is removed from C6.\n    3.  This intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl sulfinate salt, to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The final step is quenching with a proton source (aqueous ammonium chloride, NH₄Cl) to protonate the vinyllithium, yielding the final alkene product.\n*   **Product 3:** The result is the replacement of the C=O group with a C=C double bond, located between the original C1 and the less-substituted α-carbon, C6. The structure is an alkene, specifically 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules). This product has two double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether group.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) is a powerful system for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction performs two types of transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** The C=C double bonds are reduced to C-C single bonds. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) → Isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond of a benzyl ether is readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation (a process called hydrogenolysis). The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) + Toluene.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product results from the combination of all these reductions. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between the two substituents is preserved from the starting material. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-arrangement. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is incorrect as the tosylhydrazone group is removed in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. While possible under very specific, mild conditions, standard H₂/Pd-C conditions typically also cause hydrogenolysis.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches our derived product after complete hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, which is the expected outcome under the stated conditions.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This is incorrect. It suggests that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile adding to the ketone, which is inconsistent with the reaction sequence involving a tosylhydrazone.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's draw the structure. It is a six-membered ring containing a ketone (cyclohexan-1-one). We'll number the carbon with the carbonyl group as C1. At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The relative positions of the substituents at C3 and C5 are 1,3 with respect to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (Ph-CH2-Br or BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The most acidic proton in the starting material is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the hydroxymethyl substituent (pKa ≈ 16-18). NaH deprotonates this alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a derivative of hydrazine.\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazines in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction to form hydrazones. The ketone at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1: **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base. This set of conditions is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene. It involves the deprotonation of the tosylhydrazone at two positions by two equivalents of strong base (like n-BuLi), followed by the elimination of the toluenesulfinate group and nitrogen gas (N2), to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup (NH4Cl) protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   The overall result is the replacement of the original carbonyl group (C=O) with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The double bond typically forms involving the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon. In our molecule, the alpha-carbons are C2 and C6. Both are CH2 groups, but C2 is adjacent to the substituted C3, while C6 is adjacent to the substituted C5. Let's assume the formation of the more stable (less substituted) alkene, which results from the deprotonation of the less hindered alpha-proton. In this case, a double bond is formed between C1 and one of its neighbors (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** Regardless of whether the double bond forms between C1-C2 or C1-C6, the molecule becomes a cyclohexene derivative. The benzyloxy methyl group and the isopropenyl group retain their 1,3-relationship on the ring. Product 3 is a **(benzyloxymethyl)-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexene**. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction reduces multiple types of functional groups:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, reforming the cyclohexane skeleton.\n    2.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The C=C double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-O-CH2-Ph) is cleaved. The C-O bond to the benzyl group breaks, and the group is replaced by a hydrogen atom, regenerating the alcohol (-OH). Toluene is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Analysis of Transformation:**\n    *   The ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The substituent at C3 (original numbering) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n    *   The substituent at C5 (original numbering) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group at a 1,3-position relative to each other. The chemical name for this molecule is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This product would form if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as H2/Pd-C is standard for cleaving benzyl ethers.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction and subsequent hydrogenation.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This matches our deduced structure of the final product.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This would result from the nucleophilic addition of butyllithium to the ketone, not a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three main functional groups: a ketone (C=O), an alcohol (-OH), and an alkene (C=C).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br or BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the alpha-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It will then react with benzyl bromide in a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which is an Sₙ2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyl ether group (-CH2OCH2C6H5). The ketone and alkene groups are unaffected.\n    *   The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form tosylhydrazones. The acid catalyst facilitates the condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and the two hydrogens from the -NH2 group of the hydrazide are eliminated as a molecule of water, forming a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at the C-1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (-C=N-NHTs).\n    *   The structure of Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. In this reaction, a tosylhydrazone is treated with a strong base (at least two equivalents of an organolithium reagent like n-BuLi) to form an alkene. The reaction proceeds by:\n    1.  Deprotonation of the N-H proton by n-BuLi.\n    2.  Deprotonation of the less sterically hindered alpha-proton (on the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond) by a second equivalent of n-BuLi. This leads to the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate.\n    3.  Formation of a diazo intermediate which rapidly loses nitrogen gas (N2) to generate a vinyl anion (vinyllithium).\n    4.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the vinyl anion by protonating it.\n*   The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone/tosylhydrazone group with a C=C double bond. The Shapiro reaction typically forms the less-substituted alkene (anti-Zaitsev product). Therefore, the double bond will form between the original ketone carbon (C-1) and the less substituted alpha-carbon (C-6).\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene ring is formed. The other functional groups (the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group) are unchanged.\n    *   The structure of Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (numbering according to IUPAC rules for the new alkene).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** These are standard conditions for **catalytic hydrogenation**. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Importantly, Pd/C with H2 also catalyzes **hydrogenolysis**, which cleaves certain bonds, most notably the C-O bond in benzyl ethers.\n*   The following transformations will occur:\n    1.  **Reduction of the alkene in the ring:** The cyclohexene double bond is reduced to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Reduction of the alkene in the side chain:** The isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The benzyloxy group (-OCH2C6H5) is cleaved to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the benzyl part becomes toluene (which is removed during workup). So, the -CH2OBn group becomes a -CH2OH (hydroxymethyl) group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. The relative 1,3-meta relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved from the starting material. Naming this structure, we can consider it a derivative of methanol, which gives the name **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This structure matches our derived final product.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is incorrect as the tosylhydrazone is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is incorrect as the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogenolysis in Step 4.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on a ketone, but the substrate for Step 3 was a tosylhydrazone, which undergoes the Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **cyclohexan-1-one**: A six-membered carbon ring containing a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   **3-(hydroxymethyl)**: A -CH₂OH group is attached to carbon 3 of the ring.\n*   **5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)**: A propenyl group is attached at carbon 5. The name \"prop-1-en-2-yl\" means the attachment point is carbon 2 of a propene chain, where the double bond is between carbon 1 and 2. This is commonly known as an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a hydroxymethyl group at C3 and an isopropenyl group at C5. The substituents are in a 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction 1 to form Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Analysis**: Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Result**: The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OCH₂Ph or -CH₂OBn). This is a common method for protecting an alcohol group. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1**: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction 2 to form Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents**: p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂), catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction Type**: Formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Analysis**: This is a condensation reaction between the ketone of Product 1 and p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. Under acidic catalysis, the oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the =N-NH-Ts group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Result**: The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NH-Ts).\n*   **Product 2**: The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The full name would be N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction 3 to form Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents**: n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by eliminating the carbonyl oxygen entirely.\n    1.  Two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi) are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less hindered than C2 (which is adjacent to the substituent at C3). So, a proton is removed from C6.\n    2.  This dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate, with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    3.  The aqueous workup (NH₄Cl) quenches the vinyllithium, protonating the C1 position.\n*   **Result**: The tosylhydrazone at C1 is replaced by a double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3**: 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (Note: The ring numbering changes based on IUPAC rules for alkenes, but the substituent connectivity remains the same).\n\n**Step 5: Reaction 4 to form Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Palladium on carbon (Pd/C), hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Analysis**: H₂ with Pd/C is a powerful reducing agent system.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes**: It will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds. Product 3 has two C=C bonds: the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl group.\n        *   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether**: This condition is also standard for cleaving benzyl ethers (a form of deprotection). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (Ph-CH₂-O-R) is cleaved by hydrogen, yielding toluene (PhCH₃) and regenerating the original alcohol (R-OH).\n*   **Result**: All reducible groups in Product 3 are reduced. The two C=C bonds are saturated, and the benzyl protecting group is removed.\n*   **Final Structure (Product 4)**: A cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group at the original C5 position and a hydroxymethyl group at the original C3 position. These substituents are in a 1,3 relationship on the final cyclohexane ring. This structure is named (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's examine the provided options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: This structure has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3 relationship. This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**: This is incorrect; the tosylhydrazone is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. However, H₂/Pd-C is a standard and effective method for benzyl ether hydrogenolysis.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This is incorrect; it assumes a Grignard-like addition of n-butyllithium to the ketone, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction.\n\nThe most chemically sound and complete transformation leads to the structure described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **cyclohexan-1-one**: A six-membered carbon ring containing a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   **3-(hydroxymethyl)**: A -CH2OH group attached to carbon 3 of the ring.\n*   **5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)**: This is an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2, attached to carbon 5 of the ring.\n\nThe starting material has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene functional group.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    > R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Benzyl bromide (PhCH₂Br or BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first part of the step is a strong nucleophile and will attack the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n    > R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    > **Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic conditions. The nitrogen of the hydrazide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration to form a C=N bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged.\n    > **Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.**\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This set of reagents and conditions is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-carbon (C2 or C6 of the cyclohexanone ring), which is now a vinylic proton in the tosylhydrazone anion.\n*   This dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   The overall transformation replaces the original C=O group with a C=C double bond, where the double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6). Since both α-positions are symmetrically equivalent (CH₂ groups), there is no regiochemical preference.\n*   **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)** is a mild proton source used during the workup to quench the vinyllithium intermediate, protonating it to form the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The other groups are unaffected.\n    > **Product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative with a (benzyloxy)methyl group and an isopropenyl group.** For example, 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing multiple types of functional groups with hydrogen gas.\n*   The reaction will cause three transformations in Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of the alkene in the ring**: The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, reforming the cyclohexane skeleton.\n    2.  **Reduction of the isopropenyl group**: The C=C bond in the side chain is also reduced. The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether**: The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. The benzyl group is removed, and the alcohol is regenerated.\n        > R-CH₂-O-Bn + H₂ → R-CH₂-OH + Toluene\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is restored.\n    *   The substituent at position 5 becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The ketone at position 1 has been effectively reduced to a CH₂ group.\n\nThe final structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship (derived from the original 3,5-disubstituted cyclohexanone). Let's name this final product.\nThe principal functional group is the alcohol, making it a derivative of methanol. The substituent on the methanol is a `3-isopropylcyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone moiety.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether product before the final hydrogenolysis step.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name perfectly matches the structure we derived for Product 4.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies an addition of the butyl group from n-BuLi, which is not the main pathway for a Shapiro reaction. It also retains the benzyl ether, which should have been cleaved.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and benzyl bromide.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a cyclohexanone ring with three substituents. Let's number the ring starting from the carbonyl carbon as C1.\n    *   A ketone group `(C=O)` at position 1.\n    *   A hydroxymethyl group `(-CH2OH)` at position 3.\n    *   A prop-1-en-2-yl group (isopropenyl group, `-C(CH3)=CH2`) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH is a non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton of the hydroxymethyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the `-CH2OH` group to form a sodium alkoxide `(-CH2O- Na+)`.\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**. The `-CH2OH` group has become `-CH2OCH2C6H5` (often abbreviated as `-CH2OBn`).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, which has a ketone functional group.\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone's carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the `p-toluenesulfonylhydrazono` group `(=N-NH-Ts)`.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the **tosylhydrazone of Product 1**. The C=O at position 1 is converted to a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. It is used at low temperature, followed by a proton source (aqueous NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. The mechanism involves deprotonation at both the nitrogen and the α-carbon, followed by elimination of toluenesulfinate (`Ts-`) and nitrogen gas (`N2`) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The vinyllithium is then protonated by the weak acid (NH4Cl) during workup.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone functional group (now a tosylhydrazone) is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond. The new double bond will be between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of its adjacent carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is a cyclohexene derivative. For example, **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. The exact position of the double bond within the ring isn't critical for determining the final structure, as all C=C bonds will be reduced in the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl group) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation**. This reaction has two effects here:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Both the cyclohexene double bond and the isopropenyl double bond will be saturated.\n        *   `Cyclohexene ring` → `Cyclohexane ring`\n        *   `Isopropenyl group` → `Isopropyl group` (`-CH(CH3)2`)\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** It cleaves the carbon-oxygen bond of the benzyl ether. The protecting benzyl group is removed, regenerating the alcohol.\n        *   `Benzyloxy group` (`-OBn`) → `Hydroxyl group` (`-OH`)\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is fully saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl group at position 5 has become an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group at position 3 has become a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The original C1 carbonyl has become a methylene (`-CH2-`) group.\n    *   The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The substituents originate from positions 3 and 5 relative to the initial C1 carbonyl. After C1 becomes a `CH2` group, the substituents are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is `1-(hydroxymethyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane`. According to IUPAC nomenclature, this can also be named as a substituted methanol. The parent alcohol is cyclohexylmethanol. The substituent is an isopropyl group at position 3 of the cyclohexyl ring (numbering from the point of attachment). Therefore, the name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\nA) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure.\nB) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This is a tosylhydrazone, which would be an intermediate, not the final product. It also incorrectly assumes some groups were reduced while others were not.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved (no hydrogenolysis). Hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile.\n\nThe correct structure for Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3 and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **Sodium hydride (NaH):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol proton of the hydroxymethyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   **Benzyl bromide (BnBr):** An alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The resulting alkoxide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**. The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether, which serves as a protecting group for the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**. The -CH2OH group has been converted to -CH2-O-CH2-C6H5 (a benzyloxy methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide).\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazines or their derivatives under acidic catalysis to form hydrazones. Here, the ketone at C1 reacts with tosylhydrazide to form a **tosylhydrazone**. This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of the hydrazine to the carbonyl carbon, followed by the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group. The structure is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** This combination of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. It is used in stoichiometric amounts (typically >2 equivalents). The first equivalent deprotonates the sulfonamide nitrogen (-NHTs). The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon atom adjacent to the C=N bond (the α-carbon).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The resulting dianion is unstable and spontaneously eliminates nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiOTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   **Aqueous NH4Cl:** A mild proton source used during the workup to quench the vinyllithium intermediate, protonating it to form an alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The carbonyl oxygen is effectively removed and replaced by a double bond. The position of the double bond depends on which α-proton is removed. However, for the final product in this sequence, the exact position of the double bond is not critical.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group. For example, **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, which contains three reducible functional groups: a carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring, a carbon-carbon double bond in the isopropenyl side chain, and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagent:** H2 with Pd/C catalyst is a powerful reducing system.\n*   **Reactions (Catalytic Hydrogenation):**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether is cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen breaks, and both atoms are saturated with hydrogen.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH2-O-CH2Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH2-OH] + Toluene [CH3-Ph].\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a cyclohexane ring. The original C1 ketone is gone. The original C3 benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The original C5 isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The resulting product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol function in the hydroxymethyl group takes priority. The carbon atom of the ring to which this group is attached is numbered C1. The isopropyl group is then located at position C3. The name of this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as Pd/C with H2 typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This matches our derived structure perfectly.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This implies the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) failed, but subsequent hydrogenation and deprotection occurred, which is not the described sequence.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This would result from an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the reaction described for the tosylhydrazone intermediate.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule contains a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (-C(CH3)=CH2, isopropenyl group).\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ~16) than the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20).\n*   **Mechanism:** NaH removes the proton from the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) in an SN2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2-O-CH2C6H5, often abbreviated as -CH2OBn). The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction forms a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic catalysis in a condensation reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitrogen of the hydrazide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. Following proton transfers and dehydration (loss of a water molecule), a C=N bond is formed.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen and forming a C=C bond.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on a carbon alpha to the C=N bond. This dianion intermediate spontaneously eliminates nitrogen gas (N2) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium species. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (H₂O from the aqueous NH₄Cl workup), which protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The Shapiro reaction, especially with alkyllithium bases at low temperature, typically favors deprotonation at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, leading to the formation of the less substituted (kinetic) alkene. In this case, the double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of its neighbors (C2 or C6). The final constitution is a cyclohexene ring, regardless of which alpha-proton is removed.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is replaced by a C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group. A likely structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n*   **Transformations:** This step will cause three changes to Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of the alkene in the ring:** The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Reduction of the isopropenyl group:** The C=C double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, and the protecting benzyl group is removed as toluene (C₆H₅CH₃). The alcohol is regenerated. The -CH₂OBn group becomes a -CH₂OH group (hydroxymethyl).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Based on the substitution pattern of the starting material and the reaction sequence, these two groups will be in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring. The chemical name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet's evaluate the given options based on the structure of Product 4, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, which is an intermediate (Product 2) that is consumed in Step 3. Incorrect.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure contains a butyl group (from incorrect addition of n-BuLi) and a benzyl ether (which should have been cleaved). Incorrect.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved during hydrogenation. Hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for benzyl ether cleavage (debenzylation). Incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This name accurately describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂) in a 1,3-relationship. This matches our derived structure for Product 4. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n*   This is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   The parent ring is cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position C1).\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a meta relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis used to protect the alcohol functional group.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the hydroxyl (-OH) group (pKa ≈ 16-18) rather than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). This forms a sodium alkoxide intermediate (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2C6H5, often abbreviated as -CH2OBn). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst activates the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi (a very strong base) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond).\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻), which are excellent leaving groups. This generates a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup provides a proton (H⁺) to quench the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The original ketone at C1 is converted into an alkene. For example, a double bond forms between C1 and C6 (or C1 and C2).\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst that reduces multiple types of functional groups.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. This is a standard method for deprotecting benzyl ethers.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OCH₂C₆H₅) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) + Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** All reducible groups in Product 3 are reduced.\n*   **Product 4:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3- (or meta-) relationship between the substituents is maintained throughout the synthesis. The IUPAC name would be 3-isopropylcyclohexanemethanol, which is also described as (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction eliminates the tosylhydrazone group entirely.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence: a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a standard and efficient method for benzyl ether deprotection via hydrogenolysis.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile adding to the ketone (ignoring step 2), and that the subsequent hydrogenation was selective (reducing the alkene but not the benzyl ether), which contradicts the given reaction sequence and standard reactivity.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one treated with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3 and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will therefore deprotonate the alcohol, forming a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an electrophile. The nucleophilic alkoxide will attack the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction), displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This is a classic reaction for converting a carbonyl compound (a ketone in this case) into a tosylhydrazone. The reaction is an acid-catalyzed condensation where the nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (=O) at position 1 is replaced by a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. A tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base (like n-BuLi) to form an alkene.\n    *   The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton.\n    *   The second equivalent deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon (the carbon next to the C=N bond).\n    *   This is followed by the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The reaction is quenched with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone with a C=C double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=O group (originally at C1) is replaced by a C=C double bond. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and isopropenyl group) are unchanged. The resulting structure is an alkene.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon as the catalyst. This is a powerful reducing system that affects several functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The H₂/Pd-C will reduce both C=C double bonds to C-C single bonds. The double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will both be saturated. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A key reaction of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage (hydrogenolysis) of benzyl ethers (R-O-Bn). The C-O bond between the benzyl group's CH₂ and the ether oxygen is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol (R-OH) and forming toluene (from the benzyl group).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these effects:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl side chain becomes an isopropyl side chain.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is cleaved back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure retains the tosylhydrazone moiety, which is incorrect as it's eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure suggests n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile (adding a butyl group), which is not its role in the Shapiro reaction. It also fails to account for the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure correctly reflects the saturation of all double bonds and the deprotection (cleavage) of the benzyl ether to regenerate the alcohol. This perfectly matches our derived product.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if only the alkenes were reduced but the benzyl ether remained intact. While possible under very specific mild conditions, standard hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is well-known to efficiently cleave benzyl ethers. Therefore, this is a less likely product than C.\n\nThe most chemically sound and expected product of the described reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's analyze the starting material. It is a substituted cyclohexanone.\n*   The main ring is a cyclohexane.\n*   At C1, there is a ketone group (C=O).\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is a prop-1-en-2-yl group, commonly known as an isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2].\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong base. It reacts with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The starting material contains an alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The alcohol proton is more acidic and will be deprotonated by NaH to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile. **Benzyl bromide (BnBr or PhCH₂Br)** is an electrophile. The alkoxide will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n*   This reaction protects the primary alcohol as a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule (ketone and isopropenyl group) remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The -CH2OH group has become -CH2OCH₂Ph.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n*   p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones or aldehydes to form a **tosylhydrazone**.\n*   The ketone at C1 condenses with the hydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water. The C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group (where Ts represents the p-toluenesulfonyl group, -SO₂C₆H₄CH₃). The HCl catalyst facilitates this reaction.\n*   This is the standard first step for the Shapiro or Bamford-Stevens reaction.\n*   **Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n*   This two-step process is the **Shapiro elimination**.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. It is used here to perform an elimination reaction on the tosylhydrazone, not as a nucleophile. Two equivalents of base are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NHTs group. The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. Deprotonation leads to a dianion.\n*   This dianion intermediate is unstable and collapses, eliminating dinitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi), to form a vinyllithium species. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α-carbon that was deprotonated.\n*   The vinyllithium intermediate is a strong base and is then quenched by adding a proton source, in this case, **aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**. The vinyllithium is protonated to form an alkene (C=C).\n*   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, with the double bond located at the less sterically hindered side. The ketone group C=O is effectively replaced by a C=CH bond.\n*   **Product 3** is therefore a cyclohexene derivative. Both possible regioisomers (double bond at C1-C2 or C1-C6) would lead to the same final product after the next step, as they both place the substituents in a 1,3-relationship on the new alkene ring. Product 3 is a cyclohexene ring with a benzyloxymethyl group, an isopropenyl group, and a C=C double bond within the ring. For example: 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful reducing system.\n*   This reaction will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds present in product 3.\n    *   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n    *   The C=C bond of the isopropenyl side chain is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n*   Additionally, H₂/Pd-C is well-known for performing **hydrogenolysis**, which cleaves certain types of single bonds. Benzyl ethers are particularly susceptible to this reaction.\n    *   The benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph) is cleaved, reducing it back to the original hydroxyl group (-OH) and producing toluene (PhCH₃) as a byproduct.\n*   So, three transformations occur in this step: reduction of the ring double bond, reduction of the side-chain double bond, and cleavage of the benzyl ether protecting group (deprotection).\n*   Applying these transformations to product 3:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   The final molecule, **Product 4**, is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These two groups maintain their 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n*   The chemical name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, incorrect.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. While possible under very specific mild conditions, H₂/Pd-C typically causes hydrogenolysis.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches the outcome of the four-step sequence, including reduction of all double bonds and cleavage of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This results from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone, C=O).\n    *   Let's number the ring starting from the ketone at position 1.\n    *   At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   At position 5, there is a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n    *   The starting molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.

The ketone and alkene groups are unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also known as tosylhydrazine) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a classic reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative.\n    *   The nitrogen of the -NH₂ group in tosylhydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   Under acidic catalysis, this leads to a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water (H₂O).\n    *   The ketone (C=O) is converted into a **tosylhydrazone** (C=N-NHTs).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1. Its systematic name is complex, but the key structural feature is the C=N-NHTs group at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n    *   n-BuLi is a very strong base. It takes two equivalents to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice: first at the N-H bond and second at one of the alpha-carbons (C2 or C6).\n    *   The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl sulfinate salt, to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium, protonating it to form a C=C double bond.\n    *   The net result is the replacement of the C=N-NHTs group with a C=C double bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of its adjacent carbons (C2 or C6). The regioselectivity doesn't matter for the final product's constitution.\n\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It contains a benzyl ether group and two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the isopropenyl side chain).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the fourth reaction and determine the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for reducing several functional groups.\n    *   **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All C=C double bonds will be reduced to single C-C bonds.\n        *   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The C=C bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    *   **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ also cleaves benzyl ethers. This process is called hydrogenolysis.\n        *   The benzyl ether group (-CH₂OBn) is cleaved back to a hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH). The other product is toluene (PhCH₃), which is a byproduct.\n\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** We take the skeleton of Product 3 and perform all the reductions.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    *   The starting material had the hydroxymethyl and isopropenyl precursors in a 1,3-relationship on the ring (at C3 and C5 relative to the C1 ketone). This relationship is maintained throughout the synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This structure implies the benzyl ether group (-OBn) survived the final hydrogenation step. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions would cleave it.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure would result from a different reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the course of a Shapiro reaction.\n\nThe correct reaction sequence leads to the structure described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a six-membered ring containing three functional groups:\n1.  A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n2.  A primary alcohol (as a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH) at position 3.\n3.  An alkene (as an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH followed by BnBr**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) has a pKa of about 16-18, while the protons alpha to the ketone have a pKa of about 19-21. Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis), displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Result:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn). The other functional groups (ketone and alkene) remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and cat. HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reaction for the formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The hydrazine nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Result:** The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (a very strong base) followed by a proton source (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. It converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n    1.  n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile. Two equivalents are typically used. The first deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates the less sterically hindered carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    2.  The alpha-carbons are C2 (next to the bulky benzyloxymethyl group) and C6 (unsubstituted). Deprotonation will occur at C6 because it is less sterically hindered.\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts-) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Result:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is replaced with a C=C double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas and palladium on carbon catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which causes several transformations:\n    1.  **Alkene reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be hydrogenated to C-C single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, making it a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-OBn) is a common protecting group for alcohols that is cleaved under these conditions (H2, Pd/C). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, regenerating the alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Result:** All double bonds are saturated, and the benzyl ether protecting group is removed. The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-positioning of the substituents from the start of the synthesis is maintained.\n*   **Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This structure retains the tosylhydrazone moiety, which would have been eliminated in the Shapiro reaction. It is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from the incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3. It is incorrect.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This structure still has the benzyl ether protecting group. While it is an intermediate in the final step (after hydrogenation of the alkenes but before deprotection), the conditions (H2, Pd/C) are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers, so the reaction would proceed to the deprotected alcohol. Therefore, this is not the final product.\n\nThe correct sequence of transformations leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule contains a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1 (C1=O), a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Process:**\n    1.  NaH selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Thus, the alcohol is converted to a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide ion is a good nucleophile. It attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n    3.  This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts the alcohol into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide). HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Process:** This is a classic condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide (-NHNH₂) to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs) with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Ammonium chloride solution is a mild proton source for the workup.\n*   **Process:** This set of reagents is used for the Shapiro reaction, which is a method for the deoxygenation of ketones to alkenes.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the hydrazone N-H proton. The second deprotonates the α-carbon on the less sterically hindered side of the C=N bond. In this case, the proton at C6 is less hindered than the proton at C2 (which is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    2.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the lithium p-toluenesulfinate salt (LiTs). This generates a vinyllithium intermediate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n    3.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium species to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The ketone has been replaced by a double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a catalyst for hydrogenation, and H₂ is the source of hydrogen.\n*   **Process:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which has two main effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** The hydrogen adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, saturating them to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, converting it to a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is also reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved, and the oxygen is protonated, regenerating the alcohol. The benzyl group is converted to toluene.\n*   **Combining the transformations:**\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2Ph) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n    *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents maintain their 1,3-relative positions from the starting material. This molecule can be named as a substituted methanol. The main part is `methanol`, and it is attached to a `3-isopropylcyclohexyl` group.\n\n**Final Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. Debenzylation would occur.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This implies the Shapiro reaction did not proceed to completion.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from a different, less plausible reaction pathway.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   The parent ring is cyclohexanone, with the ketone at position C1.\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the hydroxyl (-OH) group, to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Outcome:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. This is a protection step for the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a derivative of hydrazine.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction forms a tosylhydrazone from the ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine part of the hydrazide (-NH2) under acidic catalysis to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone (>C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a mild proton source used for quenching.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents and substrate corresponds to the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are required. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=N double bond). There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation typically occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon. Let's assume this leads to deprotonation at C6.\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group (p-toluenesulfinate, a good leaving group) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n    4.  The final step is the addition of aqueous NH4Cl, which protonates the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Outcome:** The tosylhydrazone group is replaced by a C=C double bond. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 3:** This will be a cyclohexene derivative with two C=C bonds (one in the ring and one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether group. For instance, if the double bond forms between C1 and C6, the product is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. If it forms between C1 and C2, the product is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. In either case, the connectivity pattern after hydrogenation will be the same.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a catalyst for hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H2 is a standard combination for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved, and the oxygen is protonated, regenerating the alcohol. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Outcome:** Product 3 is fully saturated and deprotected. The molecule now consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group. Based on the starting material's connectivity (substituents at C3 and C5 relative to the C1 ketone), the final product will have these two groups in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group at a 1,3-relative position. The IUPAC name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group would have been eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether would have been cleaved by hydrogenolysis in Step 4. This is the product if the debenzylation did not occur.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies a nucleophilic addition of the butyl group from n-BuLi, which is not the function of the reagent in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the complete reduction of all C=C bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether protecting group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A six-membered ring (cyclohexane).\n*   A ketone group (=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\nThe substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr), forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction type:** Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   **Mechanism:** NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺). This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an SN2 reaction, displacing bromide. This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph).\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction type:** Hydrazone formation.\n*   **Reagents:** A ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative (p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, or tosylhydrazine) in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone undergoes a condensation reaction with tosylhydrazine, eliminating a molecule of water to form a tosylhydrazone.

The first is from the -NH- group of the hydrazone, and the second is from an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond).\n    2.  The cyclohexanone ring has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation will occur preferentially at the less sterically hindered position, which is C6 (C2 is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻), forming a vinyllithium intermediate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup protonates the vinyllithium to give a neutral alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone functionality is removed and replaced by a double bond between C1 and C6.

The starting material has acidic protons on the hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-17) and at the alpha positions to the ketone (C2 and C6, pKa ≈ 19-20). The hydroxyl proton is the most acidic. NaH will react with the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This specific reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂OCH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn). This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   **p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide** reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form tosylhydrazones. This is a condensation reaction, where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule. The acid catalyst (HCl) facilitates this reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone functional group in Product 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This is the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. It is used here in two equivalents.\n    1.  The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a carbon atom alpha to the hydrazone (at C2 or C6).\n*   This is followed by a spontaneous elimination of tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂), which generates a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction typically proceeds via deprotonation at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, leading to the less substituted alkene (anti-Zaitsev product).\n*   The **aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)** workup is a mild proton source that protonates the vinyllithium intermediate to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=NNHTs group at C1 is replaced by a C=C double bond, forming a cyclohexene ring. The benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) is a powerful reducing system.\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) will be reduced to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   Crucially, this condition also causes the **hydrogenolysis** of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved, and the oxygen is hydrogenated, regenerating the original alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n    *   R-CH₂OBn + H₂ → R-CH₂OH + Ph-CH₃ (toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** All three transformations occur:\n    1.  Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n    2.  Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    3.  Benzyloxy group → Hydroxy group (as part of hydroxymethyl)\n*   The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group. These substituents maintain their 1,3-relationship on the ring from the starting material.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is an alcohol. The parent name is derived from the alcohol functionality. It is a methanol substituted with a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers with H₂/Pd-C is a standard and expected reaction.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This implies the tosylhydrazone was not converted in the Shapiro reaction, which is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure suggests an incorrect reaction pathway, where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH): This is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  Benzyl bromide (BnBr): This is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The sodium alkoxide formed in the first step acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from reacting in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OCH₂Ph). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide to form a C=N bond, yielding a tosylhydrazone and eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst facilitates the reaction by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (=NNHTs). The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl(aq)) workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the original ketone).\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The final quench with a mild proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The C=O group of the ketone is effectively removed and replaced by a C=C double bond within the ring, adjacent to the original ketone's position.\n*   **Product 3:** This product is a cyclohexene ring substituted with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group. The exact position of the double bond in the ring depends on which α-proton is removed (from C2 or C6), but this detail is not critical for determining the final product's structure after the next step. A representative structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reduction method that will affect all three relevant functionalities in Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both the C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated) to C-C single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection):** The benzyl ether linkage is susceptible to cleavage by hydrogenation over Pd/C. The C-O bond between the benzyl group (-CH₂Ph) and the oxygen is broken, and hydrogen atoms are added. This regenerates the original alcohol and produces toluene as a byproduct.\n        (-CH₂OCH₂Ph + H₂ → -CH₂OH + Ph-CH₃).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring where the original functional groups have been transformed.\n    *   The ketone at C1 has been reduced to a CH₂ group.\n    *   The isopropenyl group at C5 has been reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The protected hydroxymethyl group at C3 has been deprotected back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The final structure has a 1,3-relationship between the isopropyl group and the hydroxymethyl group on a cyclohexane ring. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product with a 1,3-substituted cyclohexane ring bearing an isopropyl and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved during the final hydrogenation step.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies several incorrect reaction pathways, such as nucleophilic addition of the butyl group from n-BuLi and survival of the benzyl ether.\n\nThe correct structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and then Benzyl Bromide to form Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone (-C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (-C(CH3)=CH2, an isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. Comparing the alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) and the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21), the alcohol is more acidic. Thus, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    -CH2OH + NaH → -CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile. Benzyl bromide (BnBr, Ph-CH2-Br) is an excellent substrate for SN2 reactions. The alkoxide will attack the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    -CH2O⁻Na⁺ + Ph-CH2-Br → -CH2-O-CH2-Ph + NaBr\n*   The ketone and the isopropenyl group do not react under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxymethyl group has been converted to a benzyloxymethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form Product 2.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also called tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone or aldehyde. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the hydrazine nitrogen on the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The acid catalyst (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and speeding up the reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group at position 1 is converted to a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium to form Product 3.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, which is a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for a **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The mechanism involves the use of two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates the C-H bond on the carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    3.  This intermediate dianion then collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate and stable nitrogen gas (N₂), to form a vinyllithium species.\n    4.  The aqueous workup (NH₄Cl(aq)) protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   The overall transformation is the replacement of the original ketone group with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (The exact position of the double bond in the ring, C1=C2 or C1=C6, is not critical for the final structure as it will be saturated in the next step).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere to form Product 4.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two alkene groups (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reducing system that will:\n    1.  **Reduce alkenes to alkanes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated.\n        - `cyclohexene` ring → `cyclohexane` ring.\n        - `prop-1-en-2-yl` group → `isopropyl` group.\n    2.  **Perform hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (C-O-Bn) is cleaved by hydrogen, removing the benzyl protecting group and regenerating the alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        - `-CH₂OBn` group → `-CH₂OH` group.\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule has a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The initial 1,3,5 substitution pattern on the ketone ring becomes a 1,3 relative substitution pattern on the final cyclohexane ring. The IUPAC name is based on the principal functional group, which is the alcohol. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The substituent is a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Comparison with options:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, but the Shapiro reaction consumes this functional group. Incorrect.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This implies addition of a butyl group and incomplete reduction/deprotection. Incorrect.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the alkenes are reduced but the benzyl ether is not cleaved. Hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers. This is an intermediate, not the final product. Incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product after all reactions have occurred. The isopropenyl is reduced to isopropyl, the ketone is removed and the ring saturated, and the protected alcohol is deprotected. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   At C1, there is a ketone (C=O).\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\nThe relative positions of the substituents are 1, 3, and 5.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol (-OH) group (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + Bn-Br → R-CH2-O-Bn + NaBr\nThis step serves to protect the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl groups remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n1.  This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The nucleophilic nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. The reaction is catalyzed by acid (HCl) and involves the elimination of a water molecule.\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O\nThe ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(isopropenyl)cyclohexan-1-one tosylhydrazone.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n1.  This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n2.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond (at C2 or C6). This dianion then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiTs), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n3.  The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is a weak acid used during the workup to protonate the vinyllithium intermediate, yielding an alkene.\nThe net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the ketone functional group with a C=C double bond, and the original carbonyl carbon becomes a vinylic C-H. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered α-carbon, but in this case, even if a mixture of regioisomers is formed (double bond between C1-C2 or C1-C6), the final product after the next step will have the same connectivity.\n\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(isopropenyl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule contains two C=C double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing multiple types of functional groups with hydrogen gas.\n2.  **Alkene reduction:** The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will both be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n3.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** Pd/C is the standard catalyst used for the cleavage of benzyl ethers, a reaction known as hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved, and the benzyl group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol. The byproduct is toluene (PhCH₃).\n    *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-Bn] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH].\n\n**Final Product (Product 4):**\nCombining the results of Step 4:\n*   The cyclohexane ring is now saturated (cyclohexane).\n*   The substituent at the original C3 position is now a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   The substituent at the original C5 position is now an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   The ketone at C1 has been completely removed (it is now a CH₂ group).\n\nThe final molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative positions of these two substituents on the ring are 1,3 (e.g., the C3 and C5 positions of the original ketone). Therefore, the product is a 3-isopropylcyclohexylmethanol.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is consumed in the Shapiro reaction.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers.\nC) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches our derived product, where both alkenes are reduced and the benzyl ether protecting group is removed.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This assumes an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile, which is not the main pathway for the Shapiro reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   The carbon of the carbonyl group (C=O) is C1.\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\nThe molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form an alkoxide: R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an S_N2 reaction).\n*   R-CH2O⁻ + Bn-Br → R-CH2-O-Bn + Br⁻.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**. The ketone and the alkene are unaffected.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the terminal amino group of the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a standard condensation reaction.\n*   R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs → R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone.

The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on the carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The reaction is quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The C=O group of the original ketone is replaced by a C=C double bond. The ketone functional group is removed entirely from the molecule.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The substituents, the benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) and the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂), remain. The exact position of the new double bond in the ring depends on which alpha-proton is removed, but this detail is not crucial for the final structure as the entire ring will be saturated in the next step. Let's assume a representative structure like **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is **catalytic hydrogenation**, which performs two key transformations in this case:\n    1.  **Reduction of alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds.\n        *   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The C=C bond in the isopropenyl group is reduced, forming an isopropyl group: -C(CH₃)=CH₂ → -CH(CH₃)₂.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken.\n        *   R-CH₂-O-Bn + H₂ → R-CH₂-OH + Toluene (PhCH₃).\n        *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative positions of these groups on the ring (1,3-relationship) are preserved from the starting material. The structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl ether would be cleaved, and the Shapiro reaction is an elimination, not an addition of a butyl group.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is the product before the cleavage of the benzyl ether. H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for debenzylation.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure retains the tosylhydrazide moiety, which would have been eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure results from the hydrogenation of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether, which are the expected outcomes of the final step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material Analysis**\n\nThe starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Cyclohexan-1-one:** A six-membered ring with a ketone group at position C1.\n*   **3-(hydroxymethyl):** A -CH2OH group attached to C3 of the ring.\n*   **5-(prop-1-en-2-yl):** A propene group attached at C5, with the double bond between C1 and C2 of the propene chain, and the attachment point being C2. This is more commonly known as an isopropenyl group: -C(CH3)=CH2.\n\nThe molecule contains three reactive sites: a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH, then BnBr**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n    1.  NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ~16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20).\n    2.  NaH reacts with the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide: R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂.\n    3.  The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + BnBr → R-CH2-O-Bn + NaBr.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxymethyl group is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2-O-CH2C6H5). The rest of the molecule is unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a hydrazine derivative. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction forms a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   C=O + H₂N-NHTs → C=N-NHTs + H₂O.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The ketone at C1 is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-BuLi, then NH₄Cl(aq)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is for workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original ketone oxygen and creating a C=C double bond.\n    1.  n-BuLi (at least two equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice: first at the N-H bond and then at a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates the tosyl group (p-toluenesulfinate) and nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    3.  This forms a vinyllithium intermediate (a carbanion on a double-bonded carbon).\n    4.  The aqueous NH₄Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The new double bond forms between the carbon that originally carried the ketone (C1) and an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6). The deprotonation step typically occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, C6 is less hindered than C2 (which is near the bulky C3 substituent), so the double bond is expected to form between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (actual numbering depends on the major regioisomer, but this is inconsequential for the final product). The important part is that the ketone is replaced by a C=C double bond within the ring. The other groups (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) remain.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with H₂ and Pd/C**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method. It will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The C=C in the cyclohexene ring is saturated to a cyclohexane. The C=C in the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Benzyl ethers are cleaved by H₂/Pd-C. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-Bn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂-OH). The other product is toluene (C₆H₅CH₃).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The ring is a cyclohexane.\n    *   The isopropenyl group is an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group is a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with one isopropyl group and one hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-positions of these substituents are maintained from the starting material.\n    *   The name of this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, where the carbon atom of the ring attached to the -CH₂OH group is designated C1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This product retains the benzyl ether, which should have been cleaved by hydrogenolysis. This is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming nucleophilic addition of BuLi to a ketone). This is incorrect.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This product retains the tosylhydrazone moiety in a reduced form, which is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction. This is incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure correctly reflects the hydrogenation of all alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. It matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem. Let's analyze each step of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule has a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups: a ketone (C=O) at position 1, a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis used to protect the alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the starting material. The hydroxyl proton of the -CH2OH group (pKa ≈ 16-17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide intermediate.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an SN2 reaction. Bromide is displaced, and a benzyl ether is formed. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unreactive under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxyl group has been converted to a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn).\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reaction:** Formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The acidic catalyst (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, activating it for nucleophilic attack by the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide. Subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) yields the tosylhydrazone. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and isopropenyl group) do not react.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group at position 1 is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction, a method for converting a ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium, are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates one of the α-carbons (C2 or C6). The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent workup with a proton source (aqueous NH4Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to give an alkene. The net result is the reductive deoxygenation of the ketone to an alkene. The double bond is formed between the former carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexene. The exact position of the double bond in the ring (C1-C2 or C1-C6) is not critical for determining the final product, as it will be removed in the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Mechanism:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful reducing agent system. It performs two key transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of C=C double bonds:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen, a reaction called hydrogenolysis. The benzyloxy group (-OBn) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** The hydrogenation of Product 3 leads to a structure where:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is now a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The 5-(prop-1-en-2-yl) group is now a 5-isopropyl group.\n    *   The 3-((benzyloxy)methyl) group is now a 3-(hydroxymethyl) group.\n    The final molecule is 3-isopropyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane. Note that the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other. Thus, the structure can be named as **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's compare this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Retains the benzyl group and incorrectly incorporates a butyl group.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if only the double bonds were reduced, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches our derived product, accounting for the reduction of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure implies some reductions occurred but the Shapiro elimination did not.\n\nThe correct reaction cascade leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n    *   It has a ketone group (C=O) at position 1.\n    *   It has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at position 3.\n    *   It has an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction), displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Result:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxyether group (-CH₂OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH₂Ph). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a standard reaction for the formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the amine functionality (-NH₂) of the tosylhydrazide in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   **Result:** The ketone group at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs, where Ts = tosyl, -SO₂C₆H₄CH₃).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   These are the conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    *   **Mechanism:** n-Butyllithium, a very strong base, is used (typically 2 equivalents). It first deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone, and then a proton on the α-carbon (C2 or C6). This intermediate then collapses, eliminating lithium toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium species, which is then protonated by water during the aqueous workup (NH₄Cl serves as a mild acid to quench).\n    *   **Result:** The tosylhydrazone at C1 is eliminated, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed between C1 and one of its adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6). The overall effect is the deoxygenation of the ketone to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (This molecule now has two C=C double bonds: one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a highly effective catalyst for several types of reductions.\n    *   **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced (saturated).\n        1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n        2.  The double bond in the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] will be reduced to form an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** H₂/Pd-C is also very efficient at cleaving benzyl ethers. This reaction is called hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzyl group is cleaved, and hydrogen atoms are added to each fragment. The benzyloxy group (-OBn) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) is formed as a byproduct.\n        *   -CH₂OBn + H₂ → -CH₂OH + Ph-CH₃\n    *   **Result:** All reducible groups in Product 3 are transformed. The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂). The relative 1,3- (or meta) relationship of these substituents on the ring is maintained from the starting material.\n\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion: Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the starting molecule. It is a cyclohexanone ring (a six-membered ring with a ketone at C1) with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at C3 and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at C5. The molecule contains three reactive functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The hydroxyl proton of the alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will therefore deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺). The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction).\n*   **Transformation:** This step serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-CH₂C₆H₅, often abbreviated as -CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also called tosylhydrazide) reacts with ketones in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the `=N-NHTs` group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The strong base (n-BuLi, typically 2 equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice (once on the N-H, once on an α-carbon). The resulting intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion, forming a vinyllithium species. The aqueous ammonium chloride quench then protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The net result is the complete removal of the ketone functional group, replacing it with a carbon-carbon double bond. The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative containing the benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl substituents. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with H₂ will reduce all reducible functional groups in Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) will be saturated. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is also cleaved under these standard conditions. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH₂OH) and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:** All points of unsaturation are removed, and the alcohol is deprotected. The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their relative 1,3-positions on the ring are maintained from the starting material.\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the four-step reaction sequence, the final product, 4, is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Comparing this with the provided options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This perfectly matches our derived structure.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from an invalid reaction pathway for n-BuLi and fails to account for the cleavage of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This is a potential intermediate, not the final product. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard hydrogenation with Pd/C causes this deprotection (hydrogenolysis).\n\nThe most chemically sound and expected product of the entire reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This step serves to protect the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Process:** This is the standard formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group is converted into a tosylhydrazone (C=O → C=N-NHTs, where Ts = tosyl, -SO2-C6H4-CH3).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base. Aqueous NH4Cl is a mild proton source for quenching.\n*   **Process:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton, and the second deprotonates an α-carbon. The resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction is quenched with aqueous NH4Cl, which protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   **Transformation:** The entire tosylhydrazone functionality is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively eliminating the original ketone. C=N-NHTs → C=C. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (The exact position of the new double bond doesn't alter the constitution of the final product).\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Process:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both C=C double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzyl group and the oxygen is broken.\n        *   -CH2-O-Bn → -CH2-OH (+ toluene as a byproduct).\n*   **Transformation:** All unsaturations are removed, and the alcohol is deprotected. The cyclohexane ring skeleton is restored, now with an isopropyl group at position 5 and a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. The relative 1,3-positioning of these substituents is maintained throughout the sequence.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our final structure with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl group should be gone, and the ketone is eliminated, not converted to a butyl alcohol.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This is the protected alcohol. The benzyl ether should be cleaved by hydrogenolysis.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone group, which is removed in step 3.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This name accurately describes the final product with a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first visualize the starting material. It is a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups:\n*   A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\nThe two substituents (-CH2OH and isopropenyl) are in a 1,3-relationship (meta) to each other on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the primary alcohol (-CH2OH), forming a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide is a good nucleophile.\n*   The alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyl ether group (-CH2-O-CH2-C6H5, abbreviated as -CH2OBn). This step serves to protect the alcohol group from subsequent reactions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group (C=O) reacts with the hydrazine derivative in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium is a very strong base. This reaction is performed at low temperature, followed by an aqueous quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base. The first equivalent deprotonates the sulfonamide nitrogen (-NHTs). The second equivalent deprotonates a carbon alpha to the C=N bond (an α-proton). The reaction generally proceeds via deprotonation of the less sterically hindered α-proton. In our molecule, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. Both are adjacent to substituted carbons (C3 and C5, respectively), but the reaction proceeds regardless of which is deprotonated. The resulting dianion intermediate then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium species.\n*   The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond, with the double bond forming at the less substituted position. The ketone at C1 is effectively removed and replaced by a C=C bond. For instance, if the proton at C6 is removed, a double bond forms between C1 and C6. The substituents at C3 and C5 are unaffected, and their 1,3-relationship is maintained.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative, for example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This set of reagents is used to reduce carbon-carbon double bonds and also to perform hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n        *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (-CH₂-O-Bn) is cleaved. The benzyloxy group is converted back to a hydroxyl group, and the benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are an isopropyl group (from the original C5) and a hydroxymethyl group (from the original C3). Their relative 1,3-relationship is preserved. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Naming the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexane substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, with a 1,3-relationship. Naming this compound where the -CH2OH group is part of the parent name gives (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name correctly describes the final product we derived.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This would be an intermediate if the Shapiro reaction (step 3) was skipped and only hydrogenation was performed on product 2. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from several incorrect reaction pathways, including nucleophilic addition of butylithium and failure of hydrogenolysis. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated in step 4, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as Pd/C with H₂ also causes hydrogenolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's visualize the structure. It is a six-membered ring with a ketone (C=O) at position 1. At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr or C6H5CH2Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The most acidic proton in the starting material is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the hydroxymethyl side chain (pKa ≈ 16-18), which is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a potent nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis). This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH2C6H5). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a reagent used to convert carbonyl compounds into tosylhydrazones. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group (C=O) at position C1 reacts with the terminal amino group (-NH2) of the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. This is a condensation reaction that, after dehydration, forms a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of Product 1**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base. Aqueous NH4Cl is a mild proton source for quenching the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of conditions corresponds to the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong base like n-BuLi.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond, i.e., at C2 or C6). This deprotonation typically occurs at the less sterically hindered position.\n    3.  The resulting dianion spontaneously collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and a p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  This intermediate is then protonated by the addition of aqueous NH4Cl.\n*   **Result:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone group with a C=C double bond. The ketone is effectively deoxygenated and reduced to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone is removed, and a double bond is formed in the ring, adjacent to the position of the former ketone. The structure is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (assuming the double bond forms between C1 and C6, though the exact position does not affect the final product's constitution). The key features are the cyclohexene ring, the isopropenyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl protecting group.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** H2 gas with a Palladium on Carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for several types of reductions:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n    2.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The double bond of the isopropenyl side chain (-C(CH3)=CH2) will be reduced to a single bond, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group will be cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken by hydrogen, regenerating the original alcohol (-CH2OH) and producing toluene (C6H5CH3) as a byproduct. This is a standard deprotection method for benzyl ethers.\n*   **Product 4:** All reducible groups in Product 3 are reduced.\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their relative 1,3-positioning is maintained throughout the synthesis. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis with H2/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure suggests a nucleophilic attack by n-BuLi on the ketone, which is incorrect for the Shapiro reaction sequence.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone intermediate, not the final product after the Shapiro reaction and hydrogenation.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product, where all double bonds have been hydrogenated and the benzyl protecting group has been removed via hydrogenolysis.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction of the starting material with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n        *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr or PhCH₂Br):** This is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The ketone and the alkene remain unchanged.\n    *   The structure of product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Under acidic conditions (catalytic HCl), ketones react with hydrazine derivatives like tosylhydrazide to form hydrazones. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and the two hydrogen atoms from the -NH₂ group of the hydrazide are eliminated as water.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group is converted to a tosylhydrazone (-C=NNHTs). The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   The structure of product 2 is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** This is a very strong base.\n    2.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl):** This is a mild proton source for the workup step.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi). The base first deprotonates the nitrogen of the hydrazone (N-H) and then a carbon atom alpha to the C=N double bond.\n    *   The resulting dianion intermediate is unstable and collapses, eliminating a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate). This forms a vinyllithium species.\n    *   The aqueous NH₄Cl workup quenches the vinyllithium, protonating it to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall transformation of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, with the double bond located where the carbonyl group was. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain intact.\n    *   The structure of product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. (Note: the exact position of the newly formed double bond in the ring is not critical as it will be removed in the next step).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two alkene groups (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Pd/C with H₂ will reduce both carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** These conditions are also standard for cleaving benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (R-O-CH₂Ph) is broken, and the group is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Toluene is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is saturated to cyclohexane.\n    *   The isopropenyl group is saturated to isopropyl.\n    *   The benzyl ether is cleaved back to the original primary alcohol.\n    *   The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group. The relative 1,3-positions of these two groups on the ring are maintained from the starting material.\n*   **Final Structure:** The resulting structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's compare this final structure with the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This molecule still contains the benzyl ether group. Incorrect.\nB) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure results from an incorrect reaction pathway (e.g., nucleophilic addition of BuLi). Incorrect.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This molecule still contains the tosylhydrazone moiety. Incorrect.\nD) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This name correctly describes the final product: a methanol group (-CH₂OH) attached to a cyclohexane ring which is substituted with an isopropyl group at the 3-position relative to the methanol group. This matches our derived structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH₂Ph).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also known as tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone reacts with the hydrazide under acidic catalysis to form a C=N bond with the elimination of water.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. In a typical Shapiro reaction, the tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. However, looking at the final options, they are all based on a cyclohexane ring, not a cyclohexene ring. This implies that the reaction conditions led to the complete reduction of the original ketone position to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a known outcome for the reaction of tosylhydrazones, often referred to as a modified Wolff-Kishner reduction or a Bamford-Stevens reaction under specific conditions. We will proceed with this interpretation, as it is the only one that leads to one of the given answer choices.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is replaced by two hydrogen atoms. The C=O is effectively reduced to CH₂. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and the alkene) are unaffected by these reagents.\n*   **Product 3:** The starting material had substituents at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (hydroxymethyl), and 5 (isopropenyl). After this step, C1 is now a -CH₂- group. The ring is a cyclohexane with a (benzyloxy)methyl group and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at positions that are 1,3 to each other. The structure is 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexane).\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, which can reduce alkenes and also cause hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of the alkene:** The double bond in the prop-1-en-2-yl group is reduced (hydrogenated) to a single bond, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), and toluene (PhCH₃) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   -CH₂(C(CH₃)=CH₂) → -CH(CH(CH₃)₂)\n    *   -CH₂OBn → -CH₂OH\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group at positions 1 and 3. The IUPAC name for this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived final product with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The reaction pathway is wrong.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone should have reacted in step 3.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in step 4. However, H₂/Pd/C is a standard reagent for benzyl ether cleavage (hydrogenolysis), so this is an incomplete reaction.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The acidity order is alcohol-OH (pKa ≈ 16-18) > ketone α-protons (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl substituent.\n    -CH₂OH + NaH → -CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It then reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis, an Sₙ2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n    -CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → -CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected. The structure of product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also known as tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** Aldehydes and ketones react with tosylhydrazide to form tosylhydrazones. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and the two hydrogen atoms from the -NH₂ group of the hydrazide are eliminated as a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at the C-1 position of the cyclohexanone ring is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=NNHTs). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of conditions is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    1.  Two equivalents of the strong base (n-BuLi) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on one of the α-carbons (C-2 or C-6). Under kinetic control (low temperature), the base removes a proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is C-6 (C-2 is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C-3).\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. A double bond is formed between the original C-1 and C-6 positions, with the lithium atom at C-1.\n    4.  The reaction is quenched with a proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium, replacing the lithium with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone group with a carbon-carbon double bond at the less substituted position. A double bond forms between C-1 and C-6 of the original ring. The substituents at C-3 and C-5 remain, maintaining their 1,3-relationship. The structure of product 3 is an alkene, specifically a cyclohexene derivative like 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (numbering depends on the convention, but the connectivity is what matters).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds and also causes the hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n    1.  **Reduction of alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will be saturated with hydrogen.\n        - Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n        - Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogen. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken.\n        - Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH] + Toluene [PhCH₃]\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a cyclohexane skeleton. The substituent at the original C-3 position is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH), and the substituent at the original C-5 position is an isopropyl group. These two groups are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane. It can be named as 1-(hydroxymethyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane or, by treating the cyclohexane ring as a substituent on methanol, as (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This perfectly matches our derived structure.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. The benzyl group would be removed, and the addition of a butyl group is not characteristic of a Shapiro reaction quench with a proton source.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone moiety is eliminated during the Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard hydrogenation with Pd/C is expected to cause this cleavage (hydrogenolysis).\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol proton (pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis). This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph). The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unchanged. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid (HCl), reacts with ketones to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The Shapiro reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. Two equivalents of strong base (like n-BuLi) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone, and the second deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon. This dianion then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup (NH4Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene.\n*   **Result:** The ketone functionality at C1 is effectively removed and replaced with a double bond between C1 and one of its adjacent carbons (C2 or C6). The regioselectivity is not critical for the final structure, as this double bond will be reduced in the next step.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. The benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group remain intact.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation system.\n*   **Reactions:**\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds.\n        *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The Pd/C catalyst also cleaves the benzyl ether C-O bond. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene (PhCH3) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring becomes fully saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl substituent becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The (benzyloxy)methyl substituent becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These substituents retain their 1,3-relationship from the starting material. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product before the final hydrogenolysis step. The benzyl ether is still present.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure would result from an incorrect reaction pathway (nucleophilic addition of n-BuLi).\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This perfectly matches the structure deduced from the reaction sequence. It is a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2OH group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone intermediate, not the final product of the four-step sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagent 1 (NaH):** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂(g)\n*   **Reagent 2 (Benzyl Bromide, BnBr):** The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreacted.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-Toluenesulfonyl Hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl), reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by the =N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous Ammonium Chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with a strong base (at least two equivalents of n-BuLi) at low temperature.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbon of the original ketone). There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation at the less substituted carbon (C6) is kinetically favored, especially at low temperatures.\n    3.  This dianion then collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The final workup with aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium, protonating it to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The Shapiro reaction effectively reduces a ketone to an alkene, with the double bond forming at the less substituted position under kinetic control.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=N-NHTs group at C1 is replaced by a C=C double bond between C1 and C6. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) under a Hydrogen Atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reduction method. It will reduce carbon-carbon double bonds and also cleave benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be hydrogenated (saturated).\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen, converting the ether back into an alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n        *   (Benzyloxy)methyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH].\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. Tracing their positions from the start, they are at C3 and C5 relative to the original ketone, which means they are in a 1,3-relationship to each other on the final cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** 3-isopropylcyclohexylmethanol. This name indicates a methanol (CH₃OH) where one hydrogen on the carbon has been replaced by a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group. This is the same as a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) attached to a cyclohexane ring that has an isopropyl group at the 3-position.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Involves different reactions and misses the hydrogenolysis step.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This perfectly matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step did not occur.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure implies the Shapiro reaction did not occur.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is a cyclohexanone derivative with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3 and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH):** A strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. In this molecule, the proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is the most acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18). NaH removes this proton to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br):** An alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Williamson ether synthesis**. The nucleophilic alkoxide attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. The result is the formation of a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2):** Also known as tosylhydrazide.\n    *   **HCl (catalytic):** An acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with tosylhydrazide to form a **tosylhydrazone**. This is a condensation reaction where the carbonyl oxygen and two hydrogens from the -NH2 group of the hydrazide are eliminated as a water molecule (H2O), forming a C=N double bond. The acid catalyst facilitates the reaction by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.\n*   **Product 2:** The C=O group of the ketone is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group. The structure is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. In this context, two equivalents are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on the carbon atom alpha to the C=N bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl):** A mild proton source used to quench the reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the **Shapiro reaction**. The dianion formed by the action of n-BuLi is unstable and eliminates p-toluenesulfinate (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent addition of aqueous NH4Cl protonates the vinyllithium to give an alkene. The net result of this reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, effectively removing the oxygen atom. The double bond typically forms at the less substituted position (kinetic control), which is favored by low temperatures.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone group is now gone, replaced by a C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring. The benzyloxy and isopropenyl groups are unchanged. The structure is an alkene, specifically a derivative of cyclohexene, for instance, 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** The alkene with a benzyl ether and an isopropenyl group.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **Palladium on carbon (Pd/C):** A heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H2):** The reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation**. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of C=C double bonds:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced (saturated) with hydrogen. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene (C6H5CH3) is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl substituent becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The (benzyloxy)methyl substituent becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. The benzyl ether is not cleaved.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton of the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH, pKa ≈ 16-17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺).\n    2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr, PhCH₂Br):** This is an electrophile. The nucleophilic alkoxide formed in the first step attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether group (-CH₂OBn). The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which contains a ketone group.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone group reacts with the hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (commonly called a tosylhydrazone). The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (a very strong base) followed by an aqueous quench.\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for a **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone, via its tosylhydrazone, into an alkene. The mechanism involves the removal of two protons by the strong base, followed by the elimination of p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup (aq. NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to yield the final alkene. The Shapiro reaction regioselectively forms the less substituted alkene (i.e., the double bond forms between the former carbonyl carbon and the less sterically hindered adjacent α-carbon).\n*   **Analysis:** The original ketone was at C1. The adjacent α-carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is adjacent to the bulky -CH₂OBn group at C3, while C6 is unsubstituted. Therefore, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n*(Note: An alternative reaction, the Wolff-Kishner reduction, would reduce the ketone to a CH₂ group. While the reagents are more typical for a Shapiro reaction, a Wolff-Kishner type reduction would ultimately lead to the same final product after Step 4.)*\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation**. This process is highly effective at:\n    1.  **Reducing carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds:**\n        *   The cyclohexene double bond (C1=C6) will be reduced to a single bond, saturating the ring to cyclohexane.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) will be reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Cleaving benzyl ethers via hydrogenolysis:**\n        *   The benzyloxy group (-O-CH₂Ph) will be cleaved at the C-O bond, and the oxygen will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The benzyl group becomes toluene. So, the -CH₂OCH₂Ph group becomes a -CH₂OH group.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the starting cyclohexane ring is modified as follows:\n    *   The ketone at C1 has been removed (it became part of an alkene in Step 3, which was then saturated in Step 4).\n    *   The hydroxymethyl group at C3, which was protected as a benzyl ether, is deprotected back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The isopropenyl group at C5 is reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The chemical name for this molecule is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure with the given options:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether is not cleaved. This is incorrect as H₂/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from an incorrect assumption about the reaction in Step 3 (nucleophilic addition of butyl group).\n*   C) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This structure matches our derived final product.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure is inconsistent with the reactions in steps 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  **NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  **BnBr:** Benzyl bromide is an electrophilic alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide. The nitrogen of the -NH₂ group in TsNHNH₂ attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated. The acid (HCl) catalyzes this condensation reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with at least two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base like n-BuLi.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). The base preferentially removes the proton from the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the carbon at position 6 is less hindered than the carbon at position 2 (which is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    3.  The resulting intermediate dianion eliminates p-toluenesulfinate (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The aqueous NH₄Cl workup provides a proton source to quench the vinyllithium, forming an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=O group of the original ketone is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the less substituted α-carbon (C6).\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene). This molecule contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is very effective for several transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds. The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ethers:** H₂/Pd-C also cleaves benzyl ethers (R-O-CH₂Ph) at the C-O bond, reducing them to an alcohol (R-OH) and toluene (PhCH₃). The benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph] becomes a hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH].\n*   **Product 4:** All reducible groups are reduced. The cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane, the isopropenyl group becomes isopropyl, and the benzyl ether becomes an alcohol. The relative 1,3-positions of the two substituents on the ring are preserved. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy following the reaction sequence, the final product is determined to be (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Comparing this with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - **Correct.**\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the final hydrogenolysis step did not occur.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   At position 1, there is a ketone (C=O).\n    *   At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   At position 5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n    *   The molecule has three reactive sites: a primary alcohol, a ketone, and an alkene.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    *   NaH deprotonates the -CH₂OH group to form a sodium alkoxide, -CH₂O⁻Na⁺.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr), an electrophile, in an Sₙ2 reaction known as the Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-CH₂-O-CH₂-Ph, abbreviated as -CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and alkene groups are unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone.\n    *   The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) condenses with the primary amine of the hydrazide (-NH₂) to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Treatment of Product 2 at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   This is a Shapiro reaction. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    *   n-BuLi, a very strong base, is used in excess (typically >2 equivalents). It first deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone, and then a proton on a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    *   Deprotonation of the α-carbon is regioselective. The base will preferentially remove a proton from the less sterically hindered α-position. The α-carbons are C2 and C6. The substituent at C3 (-CH₂OBn) is generally bulkier than the substituent at C5 (-isopropenyl). Therefore, deprotonation is more likely to occur at C6.\n    *   The resulting intermediate eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as a sulfinate salt) to form a vinyllithium species, with the new double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The final addition of aqueous NH₄Cl serves as a proton source to quench the vinyllithium, replacing the lithium with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene is formed where the ketone used to be. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unchanged. The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene derivative with two C=C double bonds: one in the ring and one in the side chain. The structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the fourth reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for reducing several types of functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be hydrogenated to C-C single bonds.\n        *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (a deprotection reaction). The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is cleaved.\n        *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). The other product is toluene (PhCH₃), which is not part of the main structure.\n    *   This sequence (protection as a benzyl ether, reaction, and deprotection via hydrogenation) is a common strategy in organic synthesis. It is highly probable that all possible reductions occur.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has:\n    *   A cyclohexane ring.\n    *   An isopropyl group.\n    *   A hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The substituents are on the ring in a 1,3-relationship (derived from the original 3- and 5-positions of the cyclohexanone). The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is still present, meaning the Shapiro reaction (step 3) did not complete.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This name corresponds to 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is a less likely outcome under the given conditions.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The addition of a butyl group is inconsistent with a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), and an alkene (the isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    \n    R-CH₂OH + NaH → R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n    \n    The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile. It then reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis, which is an S_N2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion. This process \"protects\" the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups are unreactive under these conditions.\n    \n    R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph (a benzyl ether, ROBn) + NaBr\n    \n*   **Product 1:** The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst activates the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.\n    \n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs --(H⁺)--> R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O\n    \n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. The mechanism involves the use of at least two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi):\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the α-proton on the less sterically hindered carbon adjacent to the C=N bond. In this case, the original ketone was at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less substituted (it has two protons), so deprotonation occurs there.\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (p-toluenesulfinate anion, Ts⁻), to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The final step is quenching the reaction with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at C1 has been converted to a C=C double bond between C1 and C6. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This powerful reducing condition has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule will be reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated with hydrogen.\n        - The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n        - The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl protecting group is cleaved under these conditions. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and the oxygen is replaced with a hydrogen atom, regenerating the primary alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        - The benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂OBn] becomes a hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂OH].\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Their relative 1,3-positions on the ring are maintained throughout the synthesis.

The -OH group is now an -OCH2Ph group (often abbreviated as -OBn).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) is a derivative of hydrazine. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction converts a ketone into a tosylhydrazone. The lone pair on the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon (activated by protonation from HCl). This is followed by a dehydration step to form a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at C1 is replaced by a tosylhydrazone group (=N-NHTs).\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a mild proton source for the workup.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is the Shapiro reaction. It converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NHTs group. The second equivalent deprotonates one of the alpha-carbons (C2 or C6). Deprotonation at the less sterically hindered C6 position is generally favored.\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and spontaneously eliminates molecular nitrogen (N2) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate, where a C=C double bond has formed between C1 and C6, and the lithium is attached to C1.\n    3.  The aqueous NH4Cl workup quenches the vinyllithium, replacing the lithium atom with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone/tosylhydrazone at C1 is removed and replaced with a double bond. The ring becomes a cyclohexene. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a hydrogenation catalyst, and H2 is the source of hydrogen.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This set of reagents is very effective at reducing carbon-carbon double bonds and also causes hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers.\n    1.  **Reduction of C=C bonds:** The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane. The double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is also reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the benzyl group becomes toluene (which is removed during workup). So, the -CH2OCH2Ph group becomes a -CH2OH group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2). These substituents are in a 1,3 relationship on the ring.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This retains the tosylhydrazone group.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This structure matches our derived final product.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This retains the benzyl ether, which would be cleaved by H2/Pd-C.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from an incorrect reaction pathway (nucleophilic addition of butyl group).\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's analyze its structure:\n*   A six-membered ring (cyclohexane).\n*   A ketone group (=O) at position C1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position C3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position C5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed is a good nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n3.  **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. This step serves to protect the alcohol group from the strongly basic reagent in a later step.\n    The structure of **Product 1** is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n1.  This reaction involves the condensation of a ketone (Product 1) with a hydrazide derivative (p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, also called tosylhydrazide).\n2.  The nitrogen atom of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and subsequent dehydration (catalyzed by the acid, HCl) leads to the formation of a **tosylhydrazone**.\n3.  **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at C1 is replaced by a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n    The structure of **Product 2** is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n1.  This is a **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone (Product 2) is treated with a strong base (n-BuLi, typically 2 equivalents).\n2.  The base first deprotonates the N-H proton, then a second proton from the carbon alpha to the C=N bond (at C2 or C6). Deprotonation usually occurs at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon.\n3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n4.  The final workup with aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) protonates the vinyllithium to yield an alkene.\n5.  **Product 3:** The net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the original ketone functional group with a carbon-carbon double bond, effectively deoxygenating the ketone. The double bond will be located between the original C1 and one of its alpha-neighbors (C2 or C6). The other substituents remain. So, product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative with a benzyl ether group and an isopropenyl group. For instance, **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. The exact position of the double bond (C1=C2 or C1=C6) does not affect the final structure's connectivity after the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing several types of functional groups with H₂ gas.\n2.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated).\n    *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) → Isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n3.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is also very effective at cleaving benzyl ethers. This reaction, called hydrogenolysis, breaks the C-O bond of the ether, converting the protected alcohol back into a free alcohol.\n    *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) (plus toluene as a byproduct).\n4.  **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, we get the final structure. The cyclohexane ring now has a hydroxymethyl group at the original C3 position and an isopropyl group at the original C5 position. The ketone at C1 has been completely removed.\n\n**Final Structure Analysis:**\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a -CH2OH group and a -CH(CH3)2 group. The relative positions of these two groups are 1,3 (counting from C3 to C4 to C5). Let's name this molecule based on IUPAC rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the parent name is based on methanol. The substituent is the rest of the molecule attached to the methanol carbon. Numbering the cyclohexane ring starting from the carbon atom attached to the -CH2OH group as C1', the isopropyl group is located at C3'. Thus, the substituent is a (3'-isopropylcyclohexyl) group.\nThe name of the final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, an intermediate, not the final product.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is unlikely under the given conditions.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This perfectly matches the structure we derived.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This results from an alternative, less likely reaction pathway of n-BuLi and doesn't account for the final deprotection step.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the starting molecule. It is a cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone). Let's number the carbon of the ketone as C1. At position C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3 (or meta) relationship to each other.\n\n**Reaction 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n*   **Role of NaH:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The starting material has acidic protons on the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and at the α-carbons to the ketone (C2 and C6, pKa ≈ 19-21). The hydroxyl proton is significantly more acidic. Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the -CH2OH group to form a sodium alkoxide, -CH2O⁻Na⁺.\n*   **Role of BnBr:** Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile. It will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (a Williamson ether synthesis).\n*   **Product 1:** The -OH group is converted into a benzyl ether (-OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH2Ph). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.*\n\n**Reaction 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl**\n*   This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone group (C=O) at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (or simply, a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Product 2:** The C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group (where Ts = tosyl, p-toluenesulfonyl).\n    *Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1.*\n\n**Reaction 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n*   This is a **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second, being a strong base, deprotonates an α-carbon (C2 or C6). Deprotonation usually occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon (C6 in this case), leading to the kinetic product. This is followed by the elimination of the tosylate anion and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Quench:** The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a mild proton source, which protonates the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The C=N-NHTs group is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond, where the double bond is formed between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is an alkene. The substituents (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) are still attached to the ring at their original positions (C3 and C5 of the original numbering scheme). The 1,3-relationship between them is maintained.\n    *Product 3 is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.*\n\n**Reaction 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for this process.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced to C-C single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H2 is also effective at cleaving benzyl ethers (O-Bn). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, and the group is reduced to an alcohol (-OH). The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n*   **Product 4:** Applying these changes to Product 3:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The `3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)` group becomes a `3-isopropyl` group.\n    *   The `5-((benzyloxy)methyl)` group becomes a `5-(hydroxymethyl)` group.\n*   The final product is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between the substituent attachment points (C3 and C5 on the original ring) is preserved.\n\n**Naming Product 4 and Conclusion:**\nThe structure is a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane, where the substituents are isopropyl and hydroxymethyl.\nLet's consider the IUPAC name. If we treat the hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) part as the principal functional group, the molecule is a substituted methanol. The parent alcohol is cyclohexylmethanol. The substituents on the cyclohexane ring are named and numbered, starting from the carbon attached to the -CH2OH group as C1. The isopropyl group is at C3.\nTherefore, the name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This is a hydrazide, not the final product.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final structure.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved, but hydrogenolysis occurs under these conditions.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction sequence.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's draw the structure. It is a cyclohexanone ring with three substituents.\n*   A ketone group `(C=O)` at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group `(-CH2OH)` at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group `(-C(CH3)=CH2)` at position 5.\nThe numbering places the ketone at C1, and we number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The two types of acidic protons are the alcoholic proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (at C2 and C6, pKa ≈ 19-21). The alcohol proton is more acidic and will be deprotonated by NaH to form a sodium alkoxide `(-CH2O- Na+)`.\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br or BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n3.  The `(-CH2OH)` group is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group `(-CH2OCH2C6H5` or `-CH2OBn)`.\n\n**Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl**\n1.  This is the reaction of a ketone with a hydrazine derivative to form a **hydrazone**.\n2.  The ketone at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a **tosylhydrazone**. The nitrogen of the `-NH2` group attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n3.  The ketone `(C=O)` is converted to a tosylhydrazone group `(C=N-NHTs)`.\n\n**Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n1.  This is a **Shapiro reaction**. It converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene.\n2.  **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the original carbonyl carbon).\n3.  There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6. C2 is adjacent to the bulky `-CH2OBn` group at C3, making it sterically hindered. C6 is less hindered. At low temperatures, the reaction is under kinetic control, and the base will deprotonate the less sterically hindered proton at **C6**.\n4.  The resulting dianion eliminates the tosyl group and a molecule of nitrogen gas (N2), a very stable leaving group, to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between C1 and the deprotonated α-carbon, C6.\n5.  **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)** is a mild proton source that quenches the vinyllithium intermediate to form the final alkene product.\n\n**Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (Numbered according to IUPAC rules for the cyclohexene product, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a standard catalyst for this process.\n2.  Catalytic hydrogenation reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the isopropenyl group `(-C(CH3)=CH2)` will be reduced to form an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH3)2)`.\n3.  Critically, H2/Pd-C is also the standard reagent for the **hydrogenolysis** of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether `(-O-CH2Ph)` is cleaved, and the alcohol is regenerated. The benzyl group becomes toluene `(CH3Ph)`.\n4.  Therefore, the `(-CH2OBn)` group is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group `(-CH2OH)`.\n\n**Final Product 4:**\n*   The carbon skeleton is a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The substituents are an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   The relative positions of the substituents are preserved from the starting material (they were at C3 and C5, which is a 1,3-relationship). So, we have a 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n*   The structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: This matches our derived final structure.\nB) **(((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is less likely under standard hydrogenation conditions.\nC) **N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**: This is an incorrect structure that retains the tosylhydrazide group.\nD) **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This structure results from an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n\nThe most chemically sound pathway leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three key functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the primary alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene groups remain unchanged.\n    *   The structure of **Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the amino group of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic conditions to form a tosylhydrazone, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is replaced by a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   The structure of **Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) workup.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions are characteristic of the Shapiro reaction, which can be used for either elimination to form an alkene or, as in this case, reduction of the original carbonyl group to a methylene (CH2) group.\n    1.  Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice: once at the nitrogen (N-H) and once at the carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    2.  This intermediate dianion then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate, to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  However, a common and important variant of this reaction, often simply called a Shapiro reduction, involves quenching the intermediate (or the final vinyllithium) with a proton source like water or aqueous NH4Cl. This results in the net reduction of the ketone's carbonyl group to a methylene group (C=O → CH2). This is an effective alternative to the Wolff-Kishner or Clemmensen reductions, especially for base-sensitive substrates.\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone group is completely removed and replaced by a CH2 group. The cyclohexanone ring becomes a simple cyclohexane ring. The substituents, the (benzyloxy)methyl group and the isopropenyl group, are now on a saturated cyclohexane ring in a 1,3-relationship.\n    *   The structure of **Product 3** is 1-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexane (or an isomer with the same connectivity).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of the Alkene:** The carbon-carbon double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) will be reduced (saturated) to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** Benzyl ethers are readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, and hydrogen is added. The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH2OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and the benzyl group becomes toluene (which is removed during workup).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The structure of **Product 4** is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing our deduced structure for Product 4 with the given options:\n*   A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure perfectly.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if only the alkene were reduced and the benzyl ether remained intact.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This structure implies the tosylhydrazone was not consumed in step 3.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure results from several incorrect assumptions about the reactions, including nucleophilic addition of the butyl group.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Williamson Ether Synthesis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, an alcohol (in the hydroxymethyl group), and an alkene (in the isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. Comparing the acidity of the alcohol's proton (-CH2OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and the alpha-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20), the alcohol proton is significantly more acidic. Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   The resulting alkoxide (R-CH2O⁻ Na⁺) is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an excellent electrophile for SN2 reactions.\n    *   The alkoxide will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyl ether. The ketone and alkene functionalities remain unchanged.\n    *   The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Tosylhydrazone Formation**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   Ketones react with hydrazines (like p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide) under acidic catalysis to form hydrazones. In this case, a tosylhydrazone is formed.\n    *   The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide on the carbonyl carbon, followed by the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n    *   The structure of Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** The tosylhydrazone formed in the previous step.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   The reaction of a tosylhydrazone with two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base like n-BuLi is known as the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The n-BuLi first deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone, and then a second equivalent deprotonates a proton on the carbon atom alpha to the C=N bond (either C2 or C6).\n    *   This is followed by the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The final addition of aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium intermediate to yield an alkene.\n    *   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, effectively replacing the C=O group with a C=C double bond. The new double bond will be located between the former carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent alpha-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene is formed. Regardless of whether the new double bond is at C1-C2 or C1-C6, the product is a cyclohexene derivative containing the original isopropenyl double bond and the benzyl ether group.\n    *   The structure of Product 3 is an isomer of **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n    *   *Alternative Consideration:* In some cases, tosylhydrazones can be reduced to alkanes (C=O → CH₂). Even if this alternative pathway occurred, the final product after Step 4 would be the same, as the key transformations in Step 4 are independent of the double bond in the ring.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Thinking Process:**\n    *   Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a powerful method for reducing multiple types of functional groups.\n    *   **Reduction of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds will be reduced to single bonds. This means the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will both be saturated.\n        *   cyclohex-1-ene → cyclohexane\n        *   prop-1-en-2-yl (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) → isopropyl (-CH(CH₃)₂)\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** H₂/Pd-C is also the standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, and a C-H bond and an O-H bond are formed.\n        *   -CH₂-O-Bn → -CH₂-OH (plus toluene as a byproduct)\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the starting cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyloxy-methyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other.\n    *   This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in Step 3.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\nC) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure contains a butyl group and an intact benzyl ether, neither of which is consistent with the reaction sequence.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether, which would have been cleaved by hydrogenolysis in Step 4.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's first understand the structure of the starting material. It is a cyclohexane ring with three functional groups:\n*   A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\nThe substituents at positions 3 and 5 are in a meta-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material has an acidic proton on the hydroxyl group (-OH) and alpha-protons next to the ketone. The alcohol proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the alpha-protons (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton, which is the one on the hydroxyl group, to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is used to convert aldehydes and ketones into tosylhydrazones. The reaction is typically acid-catalyzed.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group of product 1 reacts with the amino group of tosylhydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water to form a tosylhydrazone.\n    R₂C=O + H₂NNHTs → R₂C=NNHTs + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The structure is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** This is the set of reagents for a Shapiro reaction. n-BuLi is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen and replacing it with a C=C double bond.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are typically used. The first deprotonates the -NH- group, and the second deprotonates the alpha-carbon.\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  The vinyllithium is then protonated by a proton source (water from the aqueous NH₄Cl workup).\n*   **Product 3:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is removed, and a double bond is formed in the ring (e.g., between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6). The cyclohexane ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl groups are unaffected. The product is a **cyclohexene with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group**, maintaining their 1,3-relationship on the ring. An example structure would be **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction will reduce all reducible groups in Product 3.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the isopropenyl group and the double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to single bonds.\n        - The isopropenyl group becomes an **isopropyl group**.\n        - The cyclohexene ring becomes a **cyclohexane ring**.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether C-O bond is cleaved by hydrogen, a reaction called hydrogenolysis. The benzyl group is removed as toluene, and the ether is converted back to an alcohol.\n        - The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a **hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH)**.\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The original 1,3-relationship between these substituents is maintained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product, Product 4, has the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   An isopropyl group.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   The two substituents are in a 1,3 (meta) arrangement on the ring.\n\nThis structure corresponds to the name **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is removed in Step 3.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Contains a butyl group (wrong reaction pathway) and a benzyl group (which should be removed).\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is a benzyl ether, which should have been cleaved to an alcohol by hydrogenolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's first establish the structure of the starting material. It is a cyclohexanone derivative with three functional groups: a ketone (at C1), a primary alcohol (in the hydroxymethyl group at C3), and an alkene (in the isopropenyl group at C5). The substituents on the ring at positions 3 and 5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (Bn-Br or PhCH₂Br) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. Comparing the alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) and the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20), the alcohol is more acidic. NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH₂OH + NaH → R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It will then react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (S_N2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether. The alcohol is now \"protected\" as a benzyl ether.\n    R-CH₂O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The alcohol group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph), while the ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide, TsNHNH₂) reacts with aldehydes and ketones.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic condensation reaction to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone at C1 reacts with the terminal amino group of the tosylhydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water. This reaction is catalyzed by acid (HCl).\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs → R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide. The ketone group is converted to a tosylhydrazone group.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by eliminating the entire hydrazone moiety. It requires two equivalents of a strong base.\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates a proton on the α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the original ketone position). Deprotonation generally occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon to form the kinetic product. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less hindered than C2 (which is next to the C3 substituent). Thus, a proton is removed from C6.\n    3.  This intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl sulfinate salt, to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The final step is quenching with a proton source (aqueous ammonium chloride, NH₄Cl) to protonate the vinyllithium, yielding the final alkene product.\n*   **Product 3:** The result is the replacement of the C=O group with a C=C double bond, located between the original C1 and the less-substituted α-carbon, C6. The structure is an alkene, specifically 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules). This product has two double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether group.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) is a powerful system for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction performs two types of transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** The C=C double bonds are reduced to C-C single bonds. Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) → Isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond of a benzyl ether is readily cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation (a process called hydrogenolysis). The benzyl protecting group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) + Toluene.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product results from the combination of all these reductions. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The 1,3-relationship between the two substituents is preserved from the starting material. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-arrangement. The IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is incorrect as the tosylhydrazone group is removed in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if only the alkenes were hydrogenated, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. While possible under very specific, mild conditions, standard H₂/Pd-C conditions typically also cause hydrogenolysis.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches our derived product after complete hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, which is the expected outcome under the stated conditions.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This is incorrect. It suggests that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile adding to the ketone, which is inconsistent with the reaction sequence involving a tosylhydrazone.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's draw the structure. It is a six-membered ring containing a ketone (cyclohexan-1-one). We'll number the carbon with the carbonyl group as C1. At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2). The relative positions of the substituents at C3 and C5 are 1,3 with respect to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (Ph-CH2-Br or BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The most acidic proton in the starting material is the one on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the hydroxymethyl substituent (pKa ≈ 16-18). NaH deprotonates this alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a derivative of hydrazine.\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazines in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction to form hydrazones. The ketone at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone of Product 1: **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-BuLi is a very strong base. This set of conditions is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **Reaction:** The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene. It involves the deprotonation of the tosylhydrazone at two positions by two equivalents of strong base (like n-BuLi), followed by the elimination of the toluenesulfinate group and nitrogen gas (N2), to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent aqueous workup (NH4Cl) protonates the vinyllithium.\n*   The overall result is the replacement of the original carbonyl group (C=O) with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The double bond typically forms involving the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon. In our molecule, the alpha-carbons are C2 and C6. Both are CH2 groups, but C2 is adjacent to the substituted C3, while C6 is adjacent to the substituted C5. Let's assume the formation of the more stable (less substituted) alkene, which results from the deprotonation of the less hindered alpha-proton. In this case, a double bond is formed between C1 and one of its neighbors (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** Regardless of whether the double bond forms between C1-C2 or C1-C6, the molecule becomes a cyclohexene derivative. The benzyloxy methyl group and the isopropenyl group retain their 1,3-relationship on the ring. Product 3 is a **(benzyloxymethyl)-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexene**. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction reduces multiple types of functional groups:\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, reforming the cyclohexane skeleton.\n    2.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The C=C double bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-O-CH2-Ph) is cleaved. The C-O bond to the benzyl group breaks, and the group is replaced by a hydrogen atom, regenerating the alcohol (-OH). Toluene is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Analysis of Transformation:**\n    *   The ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The substituent at C3 (original numbering) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n    *   The substituent at C5 (original numbering) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group at a 1,3-position relative to each other. The chemical name for this molecule is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This product would form if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as H2/Pd-C is standard for cleaving benzyl ethers.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction and subsequent hydrogenation.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This matches our deduced structure of the final product.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This would result from the nucleophilic addition of butyllithium to the ketone, not a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three main functional groups: a ketone (C=O), an alcohol (-OH), and an alkene (C=C).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br or BnBr).\n*   **Reaction:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the alpha-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile. It will then react with benzyl bromide in a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which is an Sₙ2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyl ether group (-CH2OCH2C6H5). The ketone and alkene groups are unaffected.\n    *   The structure of Product 1 is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form tosylhydrazones. The acid catalyst facilitates the condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom and the two hydrogens from the -NH2 group of the hydrazide are eliminated as a molecule of water, forming a C=N double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group at the C-1 position is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (-C=N-NHTs).\n    *   The structure of Product 2 is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. In this reaction, a tosylhydrazone is treated with a strong base (at least two equivalents of an organolithium reagent like n-BuLi) to form an alkene. The reaction proceeds by:\n    1.  Deprotonation of the N-H proton by n-BuLi.\n    2.  Deprotonation of the less sterically hindered alpha-proton (on the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond) by a second equivalent of n-BuLi. This leads to the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate.\n    3.  Formation of a diazo intermediate which rapidly loses nitrogen gas (N2) to generate a vinyl anion (vinyllithium).\n    4.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the vinyl anion by protonating it.\n*   The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone/tosylhydrazone group with a C=C double bond. The Shapiro reaction typically forms the less-substituted alkene (anti-Zaitsev product). Therefore, the double bond will form between the original ketone carbon (C-1) and the less substituted alpha-carbon (C-6).\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene ring is formed. The other functional groups (the benzyl ether and the isopropenyl group) are unchanged.\n    *   The structure of Product 3 is **5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene** (numbering according to IUPAC rules for the new alkene).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** These are standard conditions for **catalytic hydrogenation**. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Importantly, Pd/C with H2 also catalyzes **hydrogenolysis**, which cleaves certain bonds, most notably the C-O bond in benzyl ethers.\n*   The following transformations will occur:\n    1.  **Reduction of the alkene in the ring:** The cyclohexene double bond is reduced to a single bond, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Reduction of the alkene in the side chain:** The isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] is reduced to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The benzyloxy group (-OCH2C6H5) is cleaved to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the benzyl part becomes toluene (which is removed during workup). So, the -CH2OBn group becomes a -CH2OH (hydroxymethyl) group.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. The relative 1,3-meta relationship of these groups on the ring is preserved from the starting material. Naming this structure, we can consider it a derivative of methanol, which gives the name **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This structure matches our derived final product.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is incorrect as the tosylhydrazone is eliminated in Step 3.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is incorrect as the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogenolysis in Step 4.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile on a ketone, but the substrate for Step 3 was a tosylhydrazone, which undergoes the Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n*   **cyclohexan-1-one**: A six-membered carbon ring containing a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   **3-(hydroxymethyl)**: A -CH₂OH group is attached to carbon 3 of the ring.\n*   **5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)**: A propenyl group is attached at carbon 5. The name \"prop-1-en-2-yl\" means the attachment point is carbon 2 of a propene chain, where the double bond is between carbon 1 and 2. This is commonly known as an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n\nThe structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a hydroxymethyl group at C3 and an isopropenyl group at C5. The substituents are in a 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction 1 to form Product 1**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Analysis**: Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The alcohol's proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Result**: The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OCH₂Ph or -CH₂OBn). This is a common method for protecting an alcohol group. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1**: 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction 2 to form Product 2**\n\n*   **Reagents**: p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂), catalytic HCl.\n*   **Reaction Type**: Formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Analysis**: This is a condensation reaction between the ketone of Product 1 and p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. Under acidic catalysis, the oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the =N-NH-Ts group, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Result**: The ketone group (C=O) is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NH-Ts).\n*   **Product 2**: The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The full name would be N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction 3 to form Product 3**\n\n*   **Reagents**: n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Analysis**: The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by eliminating the carbonyl oxygen entirely.\n    1.  Two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi) are used. The first deprotonates the -NH- proton of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. C6 is less hindered than C2 (which is adjacent to the substituent at C3). So, a proton is removed from C6.\n    2.  This dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate, with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    3.  The aqueous workup (NH₄Cl) quenches the vinyllithium, protonating the C1 position.\n*   **Result**: The tosylhydrazone at C1 is replaced by a double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3**: 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (Note: The ring numbering changes based on IUPAC rules for alkenes, but the substituent connectivity remains the same).\n\n**Step 5: Reaction 4 to form Product 4**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Palladium on carbon (Pd/C), hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction Type**: Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Analysis**: H₂ with Pd/C is a powerful reducing agent system.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes**: It will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds. Product 3 has two C=C bonds: the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl group.\n        *   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether**: This condition is also standard for cleaving benzyl ethers (a form of deprotection). The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (Ph-CH₂-O-R) is cleaved by hydrogen, yielding toluene (PhCH₃) and regenerating the original alcohol (R-OH).\n*   **Result**: All reducible groups in Product 3 are reduced. The two C=C bonds are saturated, and the benzyl protecting group is removed.\n*   **Final Structure (Product 4)**: A cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group at the original C5 position and a hydroxymethyl group at the original C3 position. These substituents are in a 1,3 relationship on the final cyclohexane ring. This structure is named (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's examine the provided options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: This structure has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3 relationship. This matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**: This is incorrect; the tosylhydrazone is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene**: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. However, H₂/Pd-C is a standard and effective method for benzyl ether hydrogenolysis.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol**: This is incorrect; it assumes a Grignard-like addition of n-butyllithium to the ketone, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction.\n\nThe most chemically sound and complete transformation leads to the structure described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **cyclohexan-1-one**: A six-membered carbon ring containing a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   **3-(hydroxymethyl)**: A -CH2OH group attached to carbon 3 of the ring.\n*   **5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)**: This is an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2, attached to carbon 5 of the ring.\n\nThe starting material has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene functional group.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    > R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Benzyl bromide (PhCH₂Br or BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first part of the step is a strong nucleophile and will attack the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n    > R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    > **Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic conditions. The nitrogen of the hydrazide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration to form a C=N bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged.\n    > **Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.**\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This set of reagents and conditions is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-carbon (C2 or C6 of the cyclohexanone ring), which is now a vinylic proton in the tosylhydrazone anion.\n*   This dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   The overall transformation replaces the original C=O group with a C=C double bond, where the double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6). Since both α-positions are symmetrically equivalent (CH₂ groups), there is no regiochemical preference.\n*   **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)** is a mild proton source used during the workup to quench the vinyllithium intermediate, protonating it to form the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The other groups are unaffected.\n    > **Product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative with a (benzyloxy)methyl group and an isopropenyl group.** For example, 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing multiple types of functional groups with hydrogen gas.\n*   The reaction will cause three transformations in Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of the alkene in the ring**: The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, reforming the cyclohexane skeleton.\n    2.  **Reduction of the isopropenyl group**: The C=C bond in the side chain is also reduced. The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether**: The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. The benzyl group is removed, and the alcohol is regenerated.\n        > R-CH₂-O-Bn + H₂ → R-CH₂-OH + Toluene\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is restored.\n    *   The substituent at position 5 becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The ketone at position 1 has been effectively reduced to a CH₂ group.\n\nThe final structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship (derived from the original 3,5-disubstituted cyclohexanone). Let's name this final product.\nThe principal functional group is the alcohol, making it a derivative of methanol. The substituent on the methanol is a `3-isopropylcyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone moiety.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether product before the final hydrogenolysis step.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name perfectly matches the structure we derived for Product 4.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies an addition of the butyl group from n-BuLi, which is not the main pathway for a Shapiro reaction. It also retains the benzyl ether, which should have been cleaved.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and benzyl bromide.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a cyclohexanone ring with three substituents. Let's number the ring starting from the carbonyl carbon as C1.\n    *   A ketone group `(C=O)` at position 1.\n    *   A hydroxymethyl group `(-CH2OH)` at position 3.\n    *   A prop-1-en-2-yl group (isopropenyl group, `-C(CH3)=CH2`) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH is a non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton of the hydroxymethyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the `-CH2OH` group to form a sodium alkoxide `(-CH2O- Na+)`.\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**. The `-CH2OH` group has become `-CH2OCH2C6H5` (often abbreviated as `-CH2OBn`).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, which has a ketone functional group.\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative. The ketone's carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the `p-toluenesulfonylhydrazono` group `(=N-NH-Ts)`.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the **tosylhydrazone of Product 1**. The C=O at position 1 is converted to a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, the tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. It is used at low temperature, followed by a proton source (aqueous NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** These are the conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is converted into an alkene. The mechanism involves deprotonation at both the nitrogen and the α-carbon, followed by elimination of toluenesulfinate (`Ts-`) and nitrogen gas (`N2`) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The vinyllithium is then protonated by the weak acid (NH4Cl) during workup.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone functional group (now a tosylhydrazone) is effectively replaced by a C=C double bond. The new double bond will be between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of its adjacent carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is a cyclohexene derivative. For example, **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**. The exact position of the double bond within the ring isn't critical for determining the final structure, as all C=C bonds will be reduced in the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl group) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **catalytic hydrogenation**. This reaction has two effects here:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation:** It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. Both the cyclohexene double bond and the isopropenyl double bond will be saturated.\n        *   `Cyclohexene ring` → `Cyclohexane ring`\n        *   `Isopropenyl group` → `Isopropyl group` (`-CH(CH3)2`)\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** It cleaves the carbon-oxygen bond of the benzyl ether. The protecting benzyl group is removed, regenerating the alcohol.\n        *   `Benzyloxy group` (`-OBn`) → `Hydroxyl group` (`-OH`)\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is fully saturated.\n    *   The isopropenyl group at position 5 has become an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group at position 3 has become a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The original C1 carbonyl has become a methylene (`-CH2-`) group.\n    *   The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The substituents originate from positions 3 and 5 relative to the initial C1 carbonyl. After C1 becomes a `CH2` group, the substituents are in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is `1-(hydroxymethyl)-3-isopropylcyclohexane`. According to IUPAC nomenclature, this can also be named as a substituted methanol. The parent alcohol is cyclohexylmethanol. The substituent is an isopropyl group at position 3 of the cyclohexyl ring (numbering from the point of attachment). Therefore, the name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this final structure with the given options:\nA) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure.\nB) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - This is a tosylhydrazone, which would be an intermediate, not the final product. It also incorrectly assumes some groups were reduced while others were not.\nC) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved (no hydrogenolysis). Hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile.\n\nThe correct structure for Product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3 and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **Sodium hydride (NaH):** A strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The alcohol proton of the hydroxymethyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   **Benzyl bromide (BnBr):** An alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The resulting alkoxide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**. The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether, which serves as a protecting group for the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**. The -CH2OH group has been converted to -CH2-O-CH2-C6H5 (a benzyloxy methyl group).\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide).\n*   **Reaction:** Ketones react with hydrazines or their derivatives under acidic catalysis to form hydrazones. Here, the ketone at C1 reacts with tosylhydrazide to form a **tosylhydrazone**. This reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of the hydrazine to the carbonyl carbon, followed by the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** The C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group. The structure is **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2, a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** This combination of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi):** A very strong base. It is used in stoichiometric amounts (typically >2 equivalents). The first equivalent deprotonates the sulfonamide nitrogen (-NHTs). The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon atom adjacent to the C=N bond (the α-carbon).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The resulting dianion is unstable and spontaneously eliminates nitrogen gas (N2) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiOTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   **Aqueous NH4Cl:** A mild proton source used during the workup to quench the vinyllithium intermediate, protonating it to form an alkene.\n*   **Transformation:** The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The carbonyl oxygen is effectively removed and replaced by a double bond. The position of the double bond depends on which α-proton is removed. However, for the final product in this sequence, the exact position of the double bond is not critical.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group. For example, **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3, which contains three reducible functional groups: a carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring, a carbon-carbon double bond in the isopropenyl side chain, and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagent:** H2 with Pd/C catalyst is a powerful reducing system.\n*   **Reactions (Catalytic Hydrogenation):**\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether is cleaved. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen breaks, and both atoms are saturated with hydrogen.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH2-O-CH2Ph] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH2-OH] + Toluene [CH3-Ph].\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final molecule is a cyclohexane ring. The original C1 ketone is gone. The original C3 benzyloxymethyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group. The original C5 isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group. The resulting product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the alcohol function in the hydroxymethyl group takes priority. The carbon atom of the ring to which this group is attached is numbered C1. The isopropyl group is then located at position C3. The name of this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. This is incorrect as Pd/C with H2 typically cleaves benzyl ethers.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This matches our derived structure perfectly.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This implies the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) failed, but subsequent hydrogenation and deprotection occurred, which is not the described sequence.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This would result from an incorrect reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the reaction described for the tosylhydrazone intermediate.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule contains a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (-C(CH3)=CH2, isopropenyl group).\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ~16) than the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20).\n*   **Mechanism:** NaH removes the proton from the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺). This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) in an SN2 reaction. The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2-O-CH2C6H5, often abbreviated as -CH2OBn). The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction forms a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic catalysis in a condensation reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitrogen of the hydrazide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. Following proton transfers and dehydration (loss of a water molecule), a C=N bond is formed.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) at the C1 position is converted to a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen and forming a C=C bond.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of the strong base n-BuLi are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on a carbon alpha to the C=N bond. This dianion intermediate spontaneously eliminates nitrogen gas (N2) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium species. The reaction is then quenched with a mild proton source (H₂O from the aqueous NH₄Cl workup), which protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The Shapiro reaction, especially with alkyllithium bases at low temperature, typically favors deprotonation at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, leading to the formation of the less substituted (kinetic) alkene. In this case, the double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of its neighbors (C2 or C6). The final constitution is a cyclohexene ring, regardless of which alpha-proton is removed.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is replaced by a C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group. A likely structure is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method.\n*   **Transformations:** This step will cause three changes to Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of the alkene in the ring:** The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Reduction of the isopropenyl group:** The C=C double bond in the isopropenyl side chain (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is broken, and the protecting benzyl group is removed as toluene (C₆H₅CH₃). The alcohol is regenerated. The -CH₂OBn group becomes a -CH₂OH group (hydroxymethyl).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Based on the substitution pattern of the starting material and the reaction sequence, these two groups will be in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring. The chemical name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet's evaluate the given options based on the structure of Product 4, (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, which is an intermediate (Product 2) that is consumed in Step 3. Incorrect.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure contains a butyl group (from incorrect addition of n-BuLi) and a benzyl ether (which should have been cleaved). Incorrect.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved during hydrogenation. Hydrogenation with Pd/C is a standard method for benzyl ether cleavage (debenzylation). Incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This name accurately describes the final product: a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂) in a 1,3-relationship. This matches our derived structure for Product 4. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n*   This is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   The parent ring is cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position C1).\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   The substituents at C3 and C5 are in a meta relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr, C6H5CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis used to protect the alcohol functional group.\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the hydroxyl (-OH) group (pKa ≈ 16-18) rather than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). This forms a sodium alkoxide intermediate (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Transformation:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2C6H5, often abbreviated as -CH2OBn). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and a catalytic amount of hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst activates the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Transformation:** The ketone group (C=O) is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) quench.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi (a very strong base) are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond).\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻), which are excellent leaving groups. This generates a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    3.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup provides a proton (H⁺) to quench the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   **Transformation:** The tosylhydrazone group is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond. The original ketone at C1 is converted into an alkene. For example, a double bond forms between C1 and C6 (or C1 and C2).\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring and one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst that reduces multiple types of functional groups.\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n        *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. This is a standard method for deprotecting benzyl ethers.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OCH₂C₆H₅) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) + Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** All reducible groups in Product 3 are reduced.\n*   **Product 4:** The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3- (or meta-) relationship between the substituents is maintained throughout the synthesis. The IUPAC name would be 3-isopropylcyclohexanemethanol, which is also described as (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction eliminates the tosylhydrazone group entirely.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence: a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a standard and efficient method for benzyl ether deprotection via hydrogenolysis.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies that n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile adding to the ketone (ignoring step 2), and that the subsequent hydrogenation was selective (reducing the alkene but not the benzyl ether), which contradicts the given reaction sequence and standard reactivity.\n\nThe correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one treated with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** A cyclohexanone ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3 and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:**\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). NaH will therefore deprotonate the alcohol, forming a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an electrophile. The nucleophilic alkoxide will attack the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction), displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl.**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This is a classic reaction for converting a carbonyl compound (a ketone in this case) into a tosylhydrazone. The reaction is an acid-catalyzed condensation where the nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group (=O) at position 1 is replaced by a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), then aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction. A tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong, non-nucleophilic base (like n-BuLi) to form an alkene.\n    *   The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton.\n    *   The second equivalent deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon (the carbon next to the C=N bond).\n    *   This is followed by the elimination of lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The reaction is quenched with a mild proton source, aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone with a C=C double bond. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered position.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=O group (originally at C1) is replaced by a C=C double bond. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and isopropenyl group) are unchanged. The resulting structure is an alkene.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n\n*   **Reagents & Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon as the catalyst. This is a powerful reducing system that affects several functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Hydrogenation:** The H₂/Pd-C will reduce both C=C double bonds to C-C single bonds. The double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond of the isopropenyl group will both be saturated. The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** A key reaction of H₂/Pd-C is the cleavage (hydrogenolysis) of benzyl ethers (R-O-Bn). The C-O bond between the benzyl group's CH₂ and the ether oxygen is cleaved, regenerating the original alcohol (R-OH) and forming toluene (from the benzyl group).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these effects:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl side chain becomes an isopropyl side chain.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is cleaved back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This structure retains the tosylhydrazone moiety, which is incorrect as it's eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure suggests n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile (adding a butyl group), which is not its role in the Shapiro reaction. It also fails to account for the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether in Step 4.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure correctly reflects the saturation of all double bonds and the deprotection (cleavage) of the benzyl ether to regenerate the alcohol. This perfectly matches our derived product.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if only the alkenes were reduced but the benzyl ether remained intact. While possible under very specific mild conditions, standard hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is well-known to efficiently cleave benzyl ethers. Therefore, this is a less likely product than C.\n\nThe most chemically sound and expected product of the described reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's analyze the starting material. It is a substituted cyclohexanone.\n*   The main ring is a cyclohexane.\n*   At C1, there is a ketone group (C=O).\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is a prop-1-en-2-yl group, commonly known as an isopropenyl group [-C(CH3)=CH2].\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong base. It reacts with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The starting material contains an alcohol (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) and α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The alcohol proton is more acidic and will be deprotonated by NaH to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile. **Benzyl bromide (BnBr or PhCH₂Br)** is an electrophile. The alkoxide will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction. This is a classic **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n*   This reaction protects the primary alcohol as a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule (ketone and isopropenyl group) remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1** is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The -CH2OH group has become -CH2OCH₂Ph.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl.**\n*   p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reacts with ketones or aldehydes to form a **tosylhydrazone**.\n*   The ketone at C1 condenses with the hydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water. The C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group (where Ts represents the p-toluenesulfonyl group, -SO₂C₆H₄CH₃). The HCl catalyst facilitates this reaction.\n*   This is the standard first step for the Shapiro or Bamford-Stevens reaction.\n*   **Product 2** is the tosylhydrazone of product 1: N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n*   This two-step process is the **Shapiro elimination**.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. It is used here to perform an elimination reaction on the tosylhydrazone, not as a nucleophile. Two equivalents of base are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NHTs group. The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=N bond). In this case, the α-carbons are C2 and C6. Deprotonation leads to a dianion.\n*   This dianion intermediate is unstable and collapses, eliminating dinitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi), to form a vinyllithium species. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α-carbon that was deprotonated.\n*   The vinyllithium intermediate is a strong base and is then quenched by adding a proton source, in this case, **aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**. The vinyllithium is protonated to form an alkene (C=C).\n*   The overall result of the Shapiro reaction is the conversion of a ketone into an alkene, with the double bond located at the less sterically hindered side. The ketone group C=O is effectively replaced by a C=CH bond.\n*   **Product 3** is therefore a cyclohexene derivative. Both possible regioisomers (double bond at C1-C2 or C1-C6) would lead to the same final product after the next step, as they both place the substituents in a 1,3-relationship on the new alkene ring. Product 3 is a cyclohexene ring with a benzyloxymethyl group, an isopropenyl group, and a C=C double bond within the ring. For example: 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful reducing system.\n*   This reaction will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds present in product 3.\n    *   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n    *   The C=C bond of the isopropenyl side chain is reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n*   Additionally, H₂/Pd-C is well-known for performing **hydrogenolysis**, which cleaves certain types of single bonds. Benzyl ethers are particularly susceptible to this reaction.\n    *   The benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph) is cleaved, reducing it back to the original hydroxyl group (-OH) and producing toluene (PhCH₃) as a byproduct.\n*   So, three transformations occur in this step: reduction of the ring double bond, reduction of the side-chain double bond, and cleavage of the benzyl ether protecting group (deprotection).\n*   Applying these transformations to product 3:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   The final molecule, **Product 4**, is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. These two groups maintain their 1,3-relationship on the ring.\n*   The chemical name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, incorrect.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. While possible under very specific mild conditions, H₂/Pd-C typically causes hydrogenolysis.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure perfectly matches the outcome of the four-step sequence, including reduction of all double bonds and cleavage of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This results from an incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not what happens in a Shapiro reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone, C=O).\n    *   Let's number the ring starting from the ketone at position 1.\n    *   At position 3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   At position 5, there is a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂).\n    *   The starting molecule has three functional groups: a ketone, an alcohol, and an alkene.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule.\n    *   The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the alpha-protons next to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n    *   NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   This alkoxide is a good nucleophile. It reacts with benzyl bromide (BnBr, Ph-CH₂-Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction known as the **Williamson ether synthesis**.\n    *   The alkoxide attacks the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion. The -CH₂OH group is converted into a benzyl ether group, -CH₂-O-CH₂-Ph (abbreviated as -CH₂OBn).\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The ketone and alkene groups are unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also known as tosylhydrazine) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a classic reaction between a ketone and a hydrazine derivative.\n    *   The nitrogen of the -NH₂ group in tosylhydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n    *   Under acidic catalysis, this leads to a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water (H₂O).\n    *   The ketone (C=O) is converted into a **tosylhydrazone** (C=N-NHTs).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1. Its systematic name is complex, but the key structural feature is the C=N-NHTs group at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**.\n    *   The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n    *   n-BuLi is a very strong base. It takes two equivalents to deprotonate the tosylhydrazone twice: first at the N-H bond and second at one of the alpha-carbons (C2 or C6).\n    *   The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating dinitrogen gas (N₂) and a tosyl sulfinate salt, to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride (a mild proton source) quenches the vinyllithium, protonating it to form a C=C double bond.\n    *   The net result is the replacement of the C=N-NHTs group with a C=C double bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of its adjacent carbons (C2 or C6). The regioselectivity doesn't matter for the final product's constitution.\n\n*   **Product 3:** A cyclohexene derivative. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. It contains a benzyl ether group and two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the isopropenyl side chain).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the fourth reaction and determine the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Pd/C is a powerful catalyst for reducing several functional groups.\n    *   **Alkene Hydrogenation:** All C=C double bonds will be reduced to single C-C bonds.\n        *   The C=C bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   The C=C bond of the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    *   **Benzyl Ether Hydrogenolysis:** Pd/C with H₂ also cleaves benzyl ethers. This process is called hydrogenolysis.\n        *   The benzyl ether group (-CH₂OBn) is cleaved back to a hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH).

The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction (Step 3).\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This structure implies the benzyl ether group (-OBn) survived the final hydrogenation step. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions would cleave it.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure would result from a different reaction pathway where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile on the ketone, which is not the course of a Shapiro reaction.\n\nThe correct reaction sequence leads to the structure described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a six-membered ring containing three functional groups:\n1.  A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n2.  A primary alcohol (as a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH) at position 3.\n3.  An alkene (as an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with NaH followed by BnBr**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** NaH will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) has a pKa of about 16-18, while the protons alpha to the ketone have a pKa of about 19-21. Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction (Williamson ether synthesis), displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Result:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn). The other functional groups (ketone and alkene) remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and cat. HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard reaction for the formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The hydrazine nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon, and a molecule of water is eliminated.\n*   **Result:** The ketone group (C=O) at position 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous NH4Cl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (a very strong base) followed by a proton source (NH4Cl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. It converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n    1.  n-BuLi acts as a base, not a nucleophile. Two equivalents are typically used. The first deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone. The second deprotonates the less sterically hindered carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    2.  The alpha-carbons are C2 (next to the bulky benzyloxymethyl group) and C6 (unsubstituted). Deprotonation will occur at C6 because it is less sterically hindered.\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N2) and the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts-) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n    4.  The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, which protonates the vinyllithium species.\n*   **Result:** The tosylhydrazone group at C1 is replaced with a C=C double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas and palladium on carbon catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which causes several transformations:\n    1.  **Alkene reduction:** Both C=C double bonds in Product 3 will be hydrogenated to C-C single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, making it a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether group (-OBn) is a common protecting group for alcohols that is cleaved under these conditions (H2, Pd/C). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is broken, regenerating the alcohol and producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Result:** All double bonds are saturated, and the benzyl ether protecting group is removed. The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-positioning of the substituents from the start of the synthesis is maintained.\n*   **Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The name is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This structure retains the tosylhydrazone moiety, which would have been eliminated in the Shapiro reaction. It is incorrect.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from the incorrect assumption that n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3. It is incorrect.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This structure still has the benzyl ether protecting group. While it is an intermediate in the final step (after hydrogenation of the alkenes but before deprotection), the conditions (H2, Pd/C) are standard for cleaving benzyl ethers, so the reaction would proceed to the deprotected alcohol. Therefore, this is not the final product.\n\nThe correct sequence of transformations leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule contains a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1 (C1=O), a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Process:**\n    1.  NaH selectively deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ~16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ~19-20). Thus, the alcohol is converted to a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n    2.  The resulting alkoxide ion is a good nucleophile. It attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n    3.  This reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis, which converts the alcohol into a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl group remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide). HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Process:** This is a classic condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine of the tosylhydrazide (-NHNH₂) to form a tosylhydrazone (C=N-NHTs) with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Ammonium chloride solution is a mild proton source for the workup.\n*   **Process:** This set of reagents is used for the Shapiro reaction, which is a method for the deoxygenation of ketones to alkenes.\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are used. The first deprotonates the hydrazone N-H proton. The second deprotonates the α-carbon on the less sterically hindered side of the C=N bond. In this case, the proton at C6 is less hindered than the proton at C2 (which is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    2.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the lithium p-toluenesulfinate salt (LiTs). This generates a vinyllithium intermediate where the double bond is between C1 and C6.\n    3.  The aqueous ammonium chloride workup quenches the reaction, protonating the vinyllithium species to form a stable alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. The ketone has been replaced by a double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a catalyst for hydrogenation, and H₂ is the source of hydrogen.\n*   **Process:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which has two main effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** The hydrogen adds across all carbon-carbon double bonds, saturating them to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced, converting it to a cyclohexane ring. The double bond in the isopropenyl side chain is also reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved, and the oxygen is protonated, regenerating the alcohol. The benzyl group is converted to toluene.\n*   **Combining the transformations:**\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OCH2Ph) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n    *   The isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group. These substituents maintain their 1,3-relative positions from the starting material. This molecule can be named as a substituted methanol. The main part is `methanol`, and it is attached to a `3-isopropylcyclohexyl` group.\n\n**Final Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - This matches our derived structure.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. Debenzylation would occur.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. This implies the Shapiro reaction did not proceed to completion.\nD) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This results from a different, less plausible reaction pathway.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   The parent ring is cyclohexanone, with the ketone at position C1.\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. NaH deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton of the hydroxyl (-OH) group, to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   The resulting nucleophilic alkoxide then attacks the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n*   **Outcome:** The hydroxyl group is converted into a benzyl ether. This is a protection step for the alcohol.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a derivative of hydrazine.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction forms a tosylhydrazone from the ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the primary amine part of the hydrazide (-NH2) under acidic catalysis to form a C=N bond, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n*   **Outcome:** The ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone (>C=N-NHTs).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a mild proton source used for quenching.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents and substrate corresponds to the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Two equivalents of n-BuLi are required. The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the tosylhydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=N double bond). There are two α-carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation typically occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon. Let's assume this leads to deprotonation at C6.\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates dinitrogen gas (N2) and the tosyl group (p-toluenesulfinate, a good leaving group) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n    4.  The final step is the addition of aqueous NH4Cl, which protonates the vinyllithium species to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Outcome:** The tosylhydrazone group is replaced by a C=C double bond. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 3:** This will be a cyclohexene derivative with two C=C bonds (one in the ring and one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether group. For instance, if the double bond forms between C1 and C6, the product is 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. If it forms between C1 and C2, the product is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. In either case, the connectivity pattern after hydrogenation will be the same.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a catalyst for hydrogenation.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction has two effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** Pd/C with H2 is a standard combination for cleaving benzyl ethers (debenzylation). The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved, and the oxygen is protonated, regenerating the alcohol. The benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), producing toluene as a byproduct.\n*   **Outcome:** Product 3 is fully saturated and deprotected. The molecule now consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group. Based on the starting material's connectivity (substituents at C3 and C5 relative to the C1 ketone), the final product will have these two groups in a 1,3-relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group at a 1,3-relative position. The IUPAC name for this structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group would have been eliminated in Step 3.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether would have been cleaved by hydrogenolysis in Step 4. This is the product if the debenzylation did not occur.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies a nucleophilic addition of the butyl group from n-BuLi, which is not the function of the reagent in a Shapiro reaction.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure results from the complete reduction of all C=C bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether protecting group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A six-membered ring (cyclohexane).\n*   A ketone group (=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\nThe substituents at C3 and C5 are in a 1,3-relationship to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr), forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction type:** Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   **Mechanism:** NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻ Na⁺). This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an SN2 reaction, displacing bromide. This reaction protects the alcohol group as a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is converted to a benzyloxy group (-OCH2Ph).\n*   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction type:** Hydrazone formation.\n*   **Reagents:** A ketone reacts with a hydrazine derivative (p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, or tosylhydrazine) in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone undergoes a condensation reaction with tosylhydrazine, eliminating a molecule of water to form a tosylhydrazone.

The first is from the -NH- group of the hydrazone, and the second is from an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the C=N bond).\n    2.  The cyclohexanone ring has two α-carbons, C2 and C6. Deprotonation will occur preferentially at the less sterically hindered position, which is C6 (C2 is adjacent to the bulky substituent at C3).\n    3.  The resulting dianion intermediate collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻), forming a vinyllithium intermediate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    4.

It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The starting material has acidic protons on the hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-17) and at the alpha positions to the ketone (C2 and C6, pKa ≈ 19-20). The hydroxyl proton is the most acidic. NaH will react with the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    *   R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will attack the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This specific reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂OCH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH2OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn). This step serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   **p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide** reacts with ketones and aldehydes to form tosylhydrazones. This is a condensation reaction, where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by the =N-NHTs group, with the elimination of a water molecule. The acid catalyst (HCl) facilitates this reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone functional group in Product 1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This is the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original carbonyl oxygen.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. It is used here in two equivalents.\n    1.  The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a carbon atom alpha to the hydrazone (at C2 or C6).\n*   This is followed by a spontaneous elimination of tosylsulfinate anion (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂), which generates a vinyllithium intermediate. The reaction typically proceeds via deprotonation at the less sterically hindered alpha-carbon, leading to the less substituted alkene (anti-Zaitsev product).\n*   The **aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)** workup is a mild proton source that protonates the vinyllithium intermediate to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Product 3:** The C=NNHTs group at C1 is replaced by a C=C double bond, forming a cyclohexene ring. The benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Treatment of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) is a powerful reducing system.\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) will be reduced to form an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   Crucially, this condition also causes the **hydrogenolysis** of benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved, and the oxygen is hydrogenated, regenerating the original alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n    *   R-CH₂OBn + H₂ → R-CH₂OH + Ph-CH₃ (toluene)\n*   **Product 4:** All three transformations occur:\n    1.  Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring\n    2.  Isopropenyl group → Isopropyl group\n    3.  Benzyloxy group → Hydroxy group (as part of hydroxymethyl)\n*   The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and an isopropyl group. These substituents maintain their 1,3-relationship on the ring from the starting material.\n*   **Naming Product 4:** The molecule is an alcohol. The parent name is derived from the alcohol functionality. It is a methanol substituted with a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This perfectly matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers with H₂/Pd-C is a standard and expected reaction.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This implies the tosylhydrazone was not converted in the Shapiro reaction, which is incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure suggests an incorrect reaction pathway, where n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH): This is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will selectively deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    2.  Benzyl bromide (BnBr): This is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The sodium alkoxide formed in the first step acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction. This is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to \"protect\" the alcohol group from reacting in subsequent steps.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OCH₂Ph). The structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone carbonyl group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide to form a C=N bond, yielding a tosylhydrazone and eliminating a molecule of water. The acid catalyst facilitates the reaction by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (=NNHTs). The structure is the **tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl(aq)) workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the acidic N-H proton.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates the less sterically hindered α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the original ketone).\n    3.  The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (TsLi), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n    4.  The final quench with a mild proton source (aqueous NH₄Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to form an alkene.\n*   **Overall transformation:** The C=O group of the ketone is effectively removed and replaced by a C=C double bond within the ring, adjacent to the original ketone's position.\n*   **Product 3:** This product is a cyclohexene ring substituted with a benzyloxymethyl group and an isopropenyl group. The exact position of the double bond in the ring depends on which α-proton is removed (from C2 or C6), but this detail is not critical for determining the final product's structure after the next step. A representative structure is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two C=C double bonds (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reduction method that will affect all three relevant functionalities in Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both the C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced (saturated) to C-C single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis (Deprotection):** The benzyl ether linkage is susceptible to cleavage by hydrogenation over Pd/C. The C-O bond between the benzyl group (-CH₂Ph) and the oxygen is broken, and hydrogen atoms are added. This regenerates the original alcohol and produces toluene as a byproduct.\n        (-CH₂OCH₂Ph + H₂ → -CH₂OH + Ph-CH₃).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring where the original functional groups have been transformed.\n    *   The ketone at C1 has been reduced to a CH₂ group.\n    *   The isopropenyl group at C5 has been reduced to an isopropyl group.\n    *   The protected hydroxymethyl group at C3 has been deprotected back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The final structure has a 1,3-relationship between the isopropyl group and the hydroxymethyl group on a cyclohexane ring. This molecule is named **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare our derived structure with the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone group is eliminated in the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name accurately describes the final product with a 1,3-substituted cyclohexane ring bearing an isopropyl and a hydroxymethyl group.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved during the final hydrogenation step.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies several incorrect reaction pathways, such as nucleophilic addition of the butyl group from n-BuLi and survival of the benzyl ether.\n\nThe correct structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH and then Benzyl Bromide to form Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone (-C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (-C(CH3)=CH2, an isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. Comparing the alcohol's proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) and the alpha-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21), the alcohol is more acidic. Thus, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    -CH2OH + NaH → -CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile. Benzyl bromide (BnBr, Ph-CH2-Br) is an excellent substrate for SN2 reactions. The alkoxide will attack the benzylic carbon, displacing the bromide ion. This reaction is a classic Williamson ether synthesis, which serves to protect the alcohol group.\n    -CH2O⁻Na⁺ + Ph-CH2-Br → -CH2-O-CH2-Ph + NaBr\n*   The ketone and the isopropenyl group do not react under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxymethyl group has been converted to a benzyloxymethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide to form Product 2.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1, which is a ketone.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂, also called tosylhydrazide) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone or aldehyde. The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the hydrazine nitrogen on the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The acid catalyst (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and speeding up the reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group at position 1 is converted to a C=N-NH-Ts group.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium to form Product 3.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2, which is a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) quench.\n*   **Analysis:** These are the conditions for a **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The mechanism involves the use of two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates the C-H bond on the carbon alpha to the C=N bond.\n    3.  This intermediate dianion then collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate and stable nitrogen gas (N₂), to form a vinyllithium species.\n    4.  The aqueous workup (NH₄Cl(aq)) protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   The overall transformation is the replacement of the original ketone group with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (The exact position of the double bond in the ring, C1=C2 or C1=C6, is not critical for the final structure as it will be saturated in the next step).\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere to form Product 4.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3, which contains two alkene groups (one in the ring, one in the side chain) and a benzyl ether.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. H₂/Pd-C is a powerful reducing system that will:\n    1.  **Reduce alkenes to alkanes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be saturated.\n        - `cyclohexene` ring → `cyclohexane` ring.\n        - `prop-1-en-2-yl` group → `isopropyl` group.\n    2.  **Perform hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether (C-O-Bn) is cleaved by hydrogen, removing the benzyl protecting group and regenerating the alcohol. The benzyl group becomes toluene.\n        - `-CH₂OBn` group → `-CH₂OH` group.\n*   **Final Product (Product 4):** Combining these transformations, the final molecule has a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The initial 1,3,5 substitution pattern on the ketone ring becomes a 1,3 relative substitution pattern on the final cyclohexane ring. The IUPAC name is based on the principal functional group, which is the alcohol. Therefore, the molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The substituent is a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group.\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Comparison with options:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is a tosylhydrazone, but the Shapiro reaction consumes this functional group. Incorrect.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This implies addition of a butyl group and incomplete reduction/deprotection. Incorrect.\n*   C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is the product if the alkenes are reduced but the benzyl ether is not cleaved. Hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C typically cleaves benzyl ethers. This is an intermediate, not the final product. Incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure matches our derived final product after all reactions have occurred. The isopropenyl is reduced to isopropyl, the ketone is removed and the ring saturated, and the protected alcohol is deprotected. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   At C1, there is a ketone (C=O).\n*   At C3, there is a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   At C5, there is an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2).\nThe relative positions of the substituents are 1, 3, and 5.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n1.  **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol (-OH) group (pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n2.  **Benzyl bromide (BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The resulting alkoxide is a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion. This is a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + Bn-Br → R-CH2-O-Bn + NaBr\nThis step serves to protect the alcohol group as a benzyl ether. The ketone and the isopropenyl groups remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n1.  This is a standard reaction to form a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The nucleophilic nitrogen of the hydrazide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. The reaction is catalyzed by acid (HCl) and involves the elimination of a water molecule.\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NH-Ts → R₂C=N-NH-Ts + H₂O\nThe ketone at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The structure is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(isopropenyl)cyclohexan-1-one tosylhydrazone.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).**\n1.  This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi).\n2.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond (at C2 or C6). This dianion then collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and lithium p-toluenesulfinate (LiTs), to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n3.  The aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is a weak acid used during the workup to protonate the vinyllithium intermediate, yielding an alkene.\nThe net result of the Shapiro reaction is the replacement of the ketone functional group with a C=C double bond, and the original carbonyl carbon becomes a vinylic C-H. The double bond typically forms at the less sterically hindered α-carbon, but in this case, even if a mixture of regioisomers is formed (double bond between C1-C2 or C1-C6), the final product after the next step will have the same connectivity.\n\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(isopropenyl)cyclohex-1-ene. This molecule contains two C=C double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).**\n1.  This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing multiple types of functional groups with hydrogen gas.\n2.  **Alkene reduction:** The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will both be reduced to single bonds.\n    *   Cyclohexene ring → Cyclohexane ring.\n    *   Isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] → Isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n3.  **Hydrogenolysis of benzyl ether:** Pd/C is the standard catalyst used for the cleavage of benzyl ethers, a reaction known as hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the ether oxygen is cleaved, and the benzyl group is removed, regenerating the original alcohol. The byproduct is toluene (PhCH₃).\n    *   Benzyloxymethyl group [-CH₂-O-Bn] → Hydroxymethyl group [-CH₂-OH].\n\n**Final Product (Product 4):**\nCombining the results of Step 4:\n*   The cyclohexane ring is now saturated (cyclohexane).\n*   The substituent at the original C3 position is now a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   The substituent at the original C5 position is now an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   The ketone at C1 has been completely removed (it is now a CH₂ group).\n\nThe final molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative positions of these two substituents on the ring are 1,3 (e.g., the C3 and C5 positions of the original ketone). Therefore, the product is a 3-isopropylcyclohexylmethanol.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is consumed in the Shapiro reaction.\nB) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.

NaH reacts with the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide: R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂.\n    3.  The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction to form a benzyl ether. R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + BnBr → R-CH2-O-Bn + NaBr.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxymethyl group is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2-O-CH2C6H5). The rest of the molecule is unchanged.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is a hydrazine derivative. HCl is an acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction forms a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with the primary amine of the hydrazide in a condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   C=O + H₂N-NHTs → C=N-NHTs + H₂O.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The ketone at C1 is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-BuLi, then NH₄Cl(aq)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base. Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is for workup.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, effectively removing the original ketone oxygen and creating a C=C double bond.\n    1.  n-BuLi (at least two equivalents) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice: first at the N-H bond and then at a carbon α to the C=N bond.\n    2.  The resulting dianion is unstable and eliminates the tosyl group (p-toluenesulfinate) and nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    3.  This forms a vinyllithium intermediate (a carbanion on a double-bonded carbon).\n    4.  The aqueous NH₄Cl workup protonates the vinyllithium to give the final alkene product.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The new double bond forms between the carbon that originally carried the ketone (C1) and an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6). The deprotonation step typically occurs at the less sterically hindered α-carbon. In this case, C6 is less hindered than C2 (which is near the bulky C3 substituent), so the double bond is expected to form between C1 and C6.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene. For example, 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (actual numbering depends on the major regioisomer, but this is inconsequential for the final product). The important part is that the ketone is replaced by a C=C double bond within the ring. The other groups (benzyloxymethyl and isopropenyl) remain.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with H₂ and Pd/C**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a powerful reduction method. It will reduce multiple functional groups present in Product 3.\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The C=C in the cyclohexene ring is saturated to a cyclohexane. The C=C in the isopropenyl group is reduced to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** Benzyl ethers are cleaved by H₂/Pd-C. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂-O-Bn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂-OH). The other product is toluene (C₆H₅CH₃).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The ring is a cyclohexane.\n    *   The isopropenyl group is an isopropyl group.\n    *   The benzyloxymethyl group is a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The final structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted with one isopropyl group and one hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3-positions of these substituents are maintained from the starting material.\n    *   The name of this molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol, where the carbon atom of the ring attached to the -CH₂OH group is designated C1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This product retains the benzyl ether, which should have been cleaved by hydrogenolysis. This is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming nucleophilic addition of BuLi to a ketone). This is incorrect.\n*   C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This product retains the tosylhydrazone moiety in a reduced form, which is inconsistent with the Shapiro reaction. This is incorrect.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: This structure correctly reflects the hydrogenation of all alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether. It matches our derived structure for Product 4.\n\nTherefore, the structure of product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem. Let's analyze each step of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis molecule has a cyclohexanone ring with three functional groups: a ketone (C=O) at position 1, a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3, and an isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis used to protect the alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the starting material. The hydroxyl proton of the -CH2OH group (pKa ≈ 16-17) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-21). Therefore, NaH deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide intermediate.\n*   The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl carbon of benzyl bromide (BnBr) in an SN2 reaction. Bromide is displaced, and a benzyl ether is formed. The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unreactive under these conditions.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. The hydroxyl group has been converted to a benzyl ether (-CH2OBn).\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n*   **Reaction:** Formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone at C1 reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The acidic catalyst (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, activating it for nucleophilic attack by the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazide. Subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) yields the tosylhydrazone. The other functional groups (benzyl ether and isopropenyl group) do not react.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1. The C=O group at position 1 is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Shapiro reaction, a method for converting a ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Mechanism:** Two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium, are typically used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates one of the α-carbons (C2 or C6). The resulting dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating lithium p-toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N2) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent workup with a proton source (aqueous NH4Cl) protonates the vinyllithium to give an alkene. The net result is the reductive deoxygenation of the ketone to an alkene. The double bond is formed between the former carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6).\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexene. The exact position of the double bond in the ring (C1-C2 or C1-C6) is not critical for determining the final product, as it will be removed in the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Mechanism:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas is a powerful reducing agent system. It performs two key transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of C=C double bonds:** Both the double bond within the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen, a reaction called hydrogenolysis. The benzyloxy group (-OBn) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 4:** The hydrogenation of Product 3 leads to a structure where:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring is now a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The 5-(prop-1-en-2-yl) group is now a 5-isopropyl group.\n    *   The 3-((benzyloxy)methyl) group is now a 3-(hydroxymethyl) group.\n    The final molecule is 3-isopropyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane. Note that the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 relative to each other. Thus, the structure can be named as **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's compare this final structure with the given options:\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. Retains the benzyl group and incorrectly incorporates a butyl group.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if only the double bonds were reduced, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure matches our derived product, accounting for the reduction of both alkenes and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure implies some reductions occurred but the Shapiro elimination did not.\n\nThe correct reaction cascade leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   This is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n    *   It has a ketone group (C=O) at position 1.\n    *   It has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) at position 3.\n    *   It has an isopropenyl group (-C(CH₃)=CH₂) at position 5.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    *   **Sodium Hydride (NaH):** NaH is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxyl group to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH₂O⁻Na⁺).\n    *   **Benzyl Bromide (BnBr):** The resulting alkoxide is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the benzylic carbon of benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (Sₙ2 reaction), displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Result:** The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted into a benzyloxyether group (-CH₂OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH₂Ph). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n    *   This is a standard reaction for the formation of a tosylhydrazone from a ketone. The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the amine functionality (-NH₂) of the tosylhydrazide in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    *   **Result:** The ketone group at C1 is converted into a tosylhydrazone group (C=N-NHTs, where Ts = tosyl, -SO₂C₆H₄CH₃).\n*   **Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n    *   These are the conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. This reaction converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene.\n    *   **Mechanism:** n-Butyllithium, a very strong base, is used (typically 2 equivalents). It first deprotonates the N-H of the hydrazone, and then a proton on the α-carbon (C2 or C6). This intermediate then collapses, eliminating lithium toluenesulfinate and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a vinyllithium species, which is then protonated by water during the aqueous workup (NH₄Cl serves as a mild acid to quench).\n    *   **Result:** The tosylhydrazone at C1 is eliminated, and a carbon-carbon double bond is formed between C1 and one of its adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6). The overall effect is the deoxygenation of the ketone to an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. (This molecule now has two C=C double bonds: one in the ring and one in the isopropenyl side chain).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction 4:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a highly effective catalyst for several types of reductions.\n    *   **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds in Product 3 will be reduced (saturated).\n        1.  The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n        2.  The double bond in the isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] will be reduced to form an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** H₂/Pd-C is also very efficient at cleaving benzyl ethers. This reaction is called hydrogenolysis. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzyl group is cleaved, and hydrogen atoms are added to each fragment. The benzyloxy group (-OBn) is converted back to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) is formed as a byproduct.\n        *   -CH₂OBn + H₂ → -CH₂OH + Ph-CH₃\n    *   **Result:** All reducible groups in Product 3 are transformed. The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) and an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂). The relative 1,3- (or meta) relationship of these substituents on the ring is maintained from the starting material.\n\n*   **Product 4:** The final structure is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Conclusion: Comparing with the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** Incorrect. This structure implies n-BuLi acted as a nucleophile, which is inconsistent with the reaction sequence (ketone is protected as a tosylhydrazone before n-BuLi is added). Also, the benzyl ether is not cleaved.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** Incorrect. This structure implies Step 3 (Shapiro reaction) was skipped.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** Incorrect. This would be the product if only the alkenes were reduced, but the benzyl ether was not cleaved. Standard H₂/Pd-C conditions would also cause hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   **D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** Correct. This structure results from the reduction of both C=C bonds and the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether, which is the expected outcome of the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
