Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+) will react completely with the strong base (OH-).\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available for this reaction = 0.100 mol\n*   The weak acid (CH3COOH) will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of excess OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- ions, which makes the solution strongly basic. The presence of this excess strong base will determine the pH.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and their nature:**\n    *   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid, which is a weak acid.\n    *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid.\n    *   `Ba(OH)2`: Barium hydroxide, which is a strong base.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial moles of each species:**\n    *   The formula for moles is Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n    *   Moles of `CH3COOH` = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol.\n    *   Moles of `HCl` = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol.

Since `Ba(OH)2` is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit, the moles of `OH-` ions are 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n3.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    *   Neutralization occurs in order of strength. The strong acid (`H+` from HCl) will react with the strong base (`OH-` from `Ba(OH)2`) first.\n    *   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n        *   `H+` + `OH-` → `H2O`\n        *   Initial moles `H+` = 0.080 mol\n        *   Initial moles `OH-` = 0.180 mol\n        *   The `H+` ions are the limiting reactant.

The presence of this strong base will dominate the pH of the solution.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the final solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n    *   Calculate the final concentration of `OH-`:\n        *   [`OH-`] = Moles of excess `OH-` / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log₁₀([`OH-`]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   Calculate the pH:\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation: `pH = 12.6197...`, which rounds to 12.62.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 12.62\nB) 1.38\nC) 8.68\nD) 8.92\n\nThe calculated pH matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical reactions and calculations:\n\n**1.
