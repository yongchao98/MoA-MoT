The total probability of finding the particle anywhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1. This is the normalization condition. Mathematically, it's expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nWhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle can be found. The term |ψ(x)|² is the probability density function, which is calculated by multiplying the wave function (ψ) by its complex conjugate (ψ*).\n\n**2. Define the Wave Function (ψ) and its Complex Conjugate (ψ*)**\nThe wave function given is:\nψ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\n\nThe complex conjugate, ψ*(x), is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part ('i'):\nψ*(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability Density Function |ψ(x)|²**\nNow we multiply ψ*(x) by ψ(x):\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\n\nThis multiplication is in the form of (u + iv)(u - iv), which equals u² + v².\nHere, u = a / √(1 + x) and v = 0.5.\nSo, |ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4.

For the first part, we factor out the constant a²:\na² ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), and the integral of 0.25 is 0.25x. Now we evaluate the definite integrals:\n[ a² ln(1 + x) ] from 1 to 3 + [ 0.25x ] from 1 to 3 = 1\n\nEvaluating the first term:\na² [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2)\n\nEvaluating the second term:\n[0.25 * 3] - [0.25 * 1] = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\nNow, combine the results and set them equal to 1:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n**5.

Understand the Normalization Condition**\nIn quantum mechanics, a wave function must be normalized. This means that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it is allowed to be must be equal to 1. The probability density is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². The problem states that the particle is only found in the interval between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n∫₁³ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function is given as a complex number:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe magnitude squared of a complex number z = Re + Im*i is given by |z|² = Re² + Im².\nFor our wave function:\n-   The real part is Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n-   The imaginary part is Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n|ψ(x)|² = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ]² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3. Set Up and Solve the Normalization Integral**\nNow, we substitute this expression into our normalization condition:\n∫₁³ ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n**Solve the first integral:**\n∫₁³ [ a² / (1 + x) ] dx = a² ∫₁³ [ 1 / (1 + x) ] dx\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So, we evaluate this from 1 to 3:\na² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n= a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)]\n= a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)]\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2)\n= a² * ln(2)\n\n**Solve the second integral:**\n∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * [x] from 1 to 3\n= 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n= 0.25 * 2\n= 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for 'a'**\nNow, substitute the results of the integrals back into the normalization equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nTo find 'a', we take the square root of both sides.\na = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerical value. We know that ln(2) ≈ 0.693.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215) ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 0.85.\n\nBased on the calculation, the value of `a` is approximately 0.849, which matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nIn Quantum Mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in all of space must be equal to 1. This is known as the normalization condition. The probability density is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\nThe normalization condition is mathematically expressed as:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the entire region where the particle can exist.\n\n**Step 1: Define the wave function and the region.**\nThe wave function is given by: Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\nThe particle is confined to the region between x=1 and x=3.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².**\nThe wave function is a complex number of the form `z = real_part + i * imaginary_part`.

This is expressed by the normalization condition:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integration is performed over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\n**2. Integration Limits**\nThe problem states that the particle is only found between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, these will be the limits of our definite integral.\n\n**3. Calculate the Modulus Squared |ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function ψ(x) is a complex number. For any complex number z = Re + i*Im, the square of its modulus is |z|² = (Re)² + (Im)².\nIn our case:\n- Real part, Re(ψ) = a / √(1 + x)\n- Imaginary part, Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the square of the modulus is:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4.

Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all possible positions of the particle.\n\nIn this case, we are told that the particle is only found between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, the normalization condition becomes:\n∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²**\nThe probability density, |ψ(x)|², is the product of the wave function ψ(x) and its complex conjugate ψ*(x).\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i\n\nThe complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i\n\nNow, we multiply them:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ(x) * ψ*(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ]\n\nUsing the algebraic identity (u - v)(u + v) = u² - v², where u = a / sqrt(1 + x) and v = 0.5i:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² - (0.5i)²\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * -1)\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3.
