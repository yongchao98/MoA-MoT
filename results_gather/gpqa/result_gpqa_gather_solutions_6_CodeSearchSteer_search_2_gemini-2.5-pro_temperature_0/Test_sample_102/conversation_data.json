Analyze the Target Molecule and Required Substitution Pattern**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   The positions are 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* relationship, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical for achieving the correct substitution pattern. The directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo create a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring, the most effective strategy is to first install a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to a *meta* position (C3). The two groups together will then direct the third substituent to the remaining *meta* position (C5).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible starting steps:\n*   **Starting with Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** This would create bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect start.\n*   **Starting with Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This would create nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a *meta*-director, but it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. This is not a viable route.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This creates acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is the most promising start.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Correct Sequence Step-by-Step**\nBased on the analysis above, the correct sequence must start with acylation.\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**5. Match the Correct Sequence to the Given Options**\nNow, we match this successful three-step synthesis (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) with the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the correct pathway: Acylation, then Bromination, then Nitration. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous, but the core synthesis is correct and leads to the desired product.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This is a pointless loop that converts benzene back to benzene. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii), which fails. Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This starts with an *ortho, para*-director, leading to the wrong isomers, and also includes a failing Friedel-Crafts acylation step. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll the provided candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling, correctly identify the chemical logic that the sequence must be Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. Based on the question's specific lettering, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic analysis of the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene is required. This involves understanding the target molecule's structure, the directing effects of its substituents, and the feasibility of each reaction step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe desired product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is critical. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned carefully:\n1.  The first substituent added should be a **meta-director** to guide the second substituent to the correct position. Both the acetyl (-COCH₃) and nitro (-NO₂) groups are meta-directors.\n2.  However, a Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) **fails** on a strongly deactivated ring, such as nitrobenzene. Therefore, the first step must be the **Friedel-Crafts acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone.\n3.  The second step should be the addition of either the bromo or nitro group. The acetyl group on acetophenone will direct the next substituent to the meta-position (C3). Let's add the bromine atom next via bromination. This forms 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n4.  The final step is nitration. The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directors, substitution occurs at C5, which is meta to both deactivating groups, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe optimal sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nNow, we match this optimal sequence to the provided options.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to a 1,2 or 1,4 substitution pattern, not the required 1,3,5 pattern. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    The first three steps of this sequence are:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** The acetyl group directs bromine to the meta-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** The existing groups direct the nitro group to the C5 position, forming the final product.\n    This sequence perfectly matches the optimal synthetic strategy. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been synthesized, but the initial pathway is correct and high-yield.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This four-step process starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and inefficient loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, only Option C provides a viable and logical synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Substituent Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. We must consider how each substituent directs the next one during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Determine the Optimal Synthetic Route**: To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to introduce a *meta*-director first.\n    *   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**. Introducing the acetyl group first (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) is the best starting point. This forms acetophenone, and the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 2: Bromination**. The *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine (Br₂/FeBr₃) to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step 3: Nitration**. The final step is to nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone (HNO₃/H₂SO₄). The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. This yields the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Provided Options**: Now, I will match this correct sequence of reaction types (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) to the given options.\n    *   **A)** Starts with a pointless loop (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) that returns to benzene. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B)** The first three steps are: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Acylation); ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination); iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration). This perfectly matches the optimal synthetic route. The subsequent steps listed are extraneous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n    *   **C)** Attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii), which fails because the catalyst reacts with the basic amino group. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D)** Starts with bromination, which is an *ortho, para*-director, leading to the wrong isomers. Furthermore, the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail on the strongly deactivated ring. This is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: All candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling, correctly identify the chemical principles. The only viable pathway is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration, which corresponds to the initial steps of option B.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the goal.\n# The goal is to find the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n# This molecule has a 1,3,5-substitution pattern (acetyl, bromo, nitro).\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the directing effects of the substituents.\n# -COCH3 (acetyl) is a meta-director.\n# -Br (bromo) is an ortho, para-director.\n# -NO2 (nitro) is a meta-director.\n\n# Step 3: Determine the optimal synthetic pathway.\n# To get a 1,3,5-pattern, the best strategy is to add a meta-director first.\n# Path 1: Start with acylation.\n#   i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone (-COCH3 is a meta-director).

This name indicates a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct incoming substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Optimal Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group, forming acetophenone. This is an excellent first step because the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, setting up the correct orientation for the next substitution.\n2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The acetophenone is then brominated (Br₂/FeBr₃). The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone and establishing the required 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The final step is the nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position.

The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option C provides a chemically sound and logical route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe objective is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Positions:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* relationship, meaning all three groups are meta to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of the reactions is critical because the substituent already on the ring directs the position of the next incoming group during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Potential Synthetic Pathways\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation:**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This is an excellent first step. The acetyl group is a meta-director, setting up the correct orientation for the next substitution.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group guides the bromine to the 3-position, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable, leading to the desired product in high yield.\n    *   This sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is chemically sound.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination:** This would place an ortho, para-director on the ring first, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, which is the incorrect pattern.\n\n*   **Starting with Nitration:** This places a strong meta-director on the ring. However, a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is too strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n\n*   **Routes involving Aniline:** Any sequence that forms aniline (e.g., nitration followed by reduction) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation will fail. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction.\n\n### 4. Matching the Correct Pathway to the Given Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the correct sequence: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n*   **Option A:** Begins with a nonsensical loop that converts benzene back to benzene. Incorrect.\n*   **Option B:** Begins with bromination, leading to incorrect regiochemistry. Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Begins with nitration and reduction to aniline, followed by a Friedel-Crafts acylation which fails. Incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** The first three steps are: **i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Acylation) ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination) ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration)**. This perfectly matches the valid synthetic pathway identified above. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial sequence correctly and efficiently leads to the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only chemically viable route to the target molecule among the choices is presented in the first three steps of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe desired product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Ring:** Benzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-relationship between the substituents. All three groups are positioned *meta* to each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is critical. The directing effects of the substituents determine the position of subsequent additions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction Feasibility**\n\nCertain reactions have specific limitations:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those containing a -NO₂ group) and on rings with an amino group (-NH₂), as the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe optimal strategy to create a 1,3,5-pattern is to first install a *meta*-directing group. Let's evaluate each option based on this principle and the reaction constraints.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline.\n    2.  Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  This sequence involves nitration (i), reduction (ii), diazotization (iii), and deamination (iv). This series of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless and inefficient loop. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  Step (i) forms bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  Step (ii), nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    3.  Furthermore, step (iii), Friedel-Crafts acylation, would **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is the correct first step, as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step (ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step (iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that options A, B, and C contain chemically unfeasible or illogical steps. Only option D outlines a correct and logical pathway in its first three steps to synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in the option (iv-vii) are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been formed, but the initial sequence is the only one that works.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Formulate a Logical Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to first install a *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction adds the acetyl group. It is an excellent first step because the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which will guide subsequent substituents to the correct positions. Friedel-Crafts reactions also fail on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) or rings with basic groups (e.g., aniline), making it essential to perform this step early.\n*   **Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** Adds the bromo group.\n*   **Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** Adds the nitro group.\n\nThe most logical sequence is:\n1.  **Acylation:** Start with benzene and add the acetyl group to form acetophenone. This establishes a *meta*-director on the ring.\n2.  **Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's match our derived strategy to the provided options.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii). This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield the wrong isomers (1,2- and 1,4-products), not the required 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, the final acylation step would **fail** on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene via deamination. This is a pointless and inefficient loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    The first three steps of this sequence are:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    This perfectly matches the logical synthetic pathway derived above. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been formed, but the initial sequence is correct and leads to a high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a thorough analysis of reaction mechanisms and substituent directing effects, Option D is the only one that presents a chemically viable and logical route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1.

The other options contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Goal:** Synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Chemical Principles**\n\nThe synthesis requires a sequence of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions. The order is critical and is governed by two main factors:\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n*   **Reaction Feasibility:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with a basic amino group (-NH₂), as the catalyst complexes with the nitrogen.\n\n### **3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical approach is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Reacting benzene with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` forms acetophenone. This is the ideal first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the other *meta* position (C5). Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this correct strategy to the specific options provided. The extra steps (iv-vii) listed in the options are superfluous distractors; the core synthesis in the first three steps is what determines the correct choice.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. The next step (nitration) would lead to a 1,2 or 1,4 product, not the required 1,3,5 pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   The first three steps are: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. This perfectly matches the optimal synthetic strategy and successfully produces the target molecule. **Correct.**\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence (nitration → reduction → diazotization → deamination) is a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence creates aniline (steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group complexes with the AlCl₃ catalyst. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous chemical analysis, the only viable pathway is presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions in electrophilic aromatic substitution is critical. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to introduce a *meta*-directing group first.\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Reacting benzene with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ forms acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided in the question against this optimal pathway.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline. The third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, **fails** because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield a 1,2 or 1,4-disubstituted product, which is the wrong regiochemistry for the final 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, the final acylation step would **fail** on a ring strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    The first three steps of this sequence are:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    This perfectly matches the optimal synthetic route. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed, but the initial pathway is correct and high-yield. This is the correct option.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere is a clear consensus in the chemical reasoning among all provided candidate answers: the only viable pathway is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. This sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option C. The other options contain chemically unfeasible steps or are illogical.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH₃)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of reactions is critical for achieving the correct substitution pattern. The directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Pathways\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to introduce a *meta*-directing group first.\n\n*   **Starting with Acylation (-COCH₃):** This is an excellent strategy. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and will guide the next two substituents into the correct positions.\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** In 3-bromoacetophenone, the acetyl group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group (at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site of substitution. This pathway successfully yields the target molecule.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (-Br):** This is an incorrect strategy. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The second substituent would be added to the ortho or para position, leading to a 1,2- or 1,4-disubstituted product, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n*   **Starting with Nitration (-NO₂):** This strategy is not viable. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction would fail on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring.\n\n### 4. Match the Correct Pathway to the Given Options\nBased on the analysis, the only viable synthetic route is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. We now check which option matches this sequence.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This starts with nitration. As discussed, a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation will fail. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**: This starts with bromination, which leads to the wrong isomers. This option is incorrect.\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This sequence matches our valid pathway.\n    *   Step (i) is Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   Step (ii) is bromination at the meta position.\n    *   Step (iii) is nitration at the other meta position.\n    This sequence successfully produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This sequence begins with a series of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) that convert benzene back into benzene, making it a pointless loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only chemically sound and logical sequence that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is presented in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a first-principles chemical evaluation, the following step-by-step process determines the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe objective is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of the reactions is critical because existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Reaction Feasibility and Strategy\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group. This will guide the subsequent substitutions into the correct positions. We must also consider key reaction limitations:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) and on rings containing an amino group (-NH₂), as the catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as provided in the original question prompt:\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, yielding bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This 1,2 or 1,4-pattern cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product. Furthermore, the final acylation step would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination. This four-step process starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence represents the only chemically sound pathway:\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is the ideal first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This leads to the desired target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The first three steps constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous consensus among all candidate answers, and a rigorous chemical analysis, confirms that the only viable synthetic route is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. Based on the options provided in the prompt, this sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the benzene ring direct where new groups will be added during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group. We must also consider the feasibility of each reaction step.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as the acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a **meta-director**, which is required to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and provides a high-yield pathway to the desired product. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination.

The basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Bromination):** Benzene is converted to bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Nitration):** This step would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, establishing a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    3.  **Step iii (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction would **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect due to both wrong regiochemistry and reaction failure.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, Option A is the only sequence that provides a chemically logical and viable pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield.

    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the target molecule and the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe desired product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are located at positions 1, 3, and 5.

Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it strongly deactivates the ring, causing the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation step to fail.\n    *   Therefore, the only logical first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation**.\n\n2.  **Construct the Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` to form acetophenone.

Analyze the Target Molecule and Required Substitution Pattern**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   The positions are 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* relationship, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical for achieving the correct substitution pattern. The directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo create a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring, the most effective strategy is to first install a *meta*-director. This will guide the second substituent to a *meta* position (C3). The two groups together will then direct the third substituent to the remaining *meta* position (C5).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible starting steps:\n*   **Starting with Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** This would create bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect start.\n*   **Starting with Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This would create nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a *meta*-director, but it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. This is not a viable route.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This creates acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is the most promising start.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Correct Sequence Step-by-Step**\nBased on the analysis above, the correct sequence must start with acylation.\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**5. Match the Correct Sequence to the Given Options**\nNow, we match this successful three-step synthesis (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) with the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the correct pathway: Acylation, then Bromination, then Nitration.

Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll the provided candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling, correctly identify the chemical logic that the sequence must be Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. Based on the question's specific lettering, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, a systematic analysis of the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene is required. This involves understanding the target molecule's structure, the directing effects of its substituents, and the feasibility of each reaction step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe desired product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is critical. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned carefully:\n1.  The first substituent added should be a **meta-director** to guide the second substituent to the correct position. Both the acetyl (-COCH₃) and nitro (-NO₂) groups are meta-directors.\n2.  However, a Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) **fails** on a strongly deactivated ring, such as nitrobenzene. Therefore, the first step must be the **Friedel-Crafts acylation** of benzene to form acetophenone.\n3.  The second step should be the addition of either the bromo or nitro group. The acetyl group on acetophenone will direct the next substituent to the meta-position (C3). Let's add the bromine atom next via bromination. This forms 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n4.  The final step is nitration. The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directors, substitution occurs at C5, which is meta to both deactivating groups, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe optimal sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nNow, we match this optimal sequence to the provided options.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to a 1,2 or 1,4 substitution pattern, not the required 1,3,5 pattern. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    The first three steps of this sequence are:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** The acetyl group directs bromine to the meta-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** The existing groups direct the nitro group to the C5 position, forming the final product.\n    This sequence perfectly matches the optimal synthetic strategy. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been synthesized, but the initial pathway is correct and high-yield.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This four-step process starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and inefficient loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, only Option C provides a viable and logical synthetic route to 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Substituent Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. We must consider how each substituent directs the next one during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃)**: Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Determine the Optimal Synthetic Route**: To achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to introduce a *meta*-director first.\n    *   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**. Introducing the acetyl group first (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) is the best starting point. This forms acetophenone, and the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step 2: Bromination**. The *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine (Br₂/FeBr₃) to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step 3: Nitration**. The final step is to nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone (HNO₃/H₂SO₄). The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. This yields the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Provided Options**: Now, I will match this correct sequence of reaction types (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) to the given options.\n    *   **A)** Starts with a pointless loop (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) that returns to benzene. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B)** The first three steps are: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Acylation); ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination); iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration). This perfectly matches the optimal synthetic route. The subsequent steps listed are extraneous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n    *   **C)** Attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii), which fails because the catalyst reacts with the basic amino group. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D)** Starts with bromination, which is an *ortho, para*-director, leading to the wrong isomers. Furthermore, the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail on the strongly deactivated ring. This is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: All candidate answers, despite some confusion in labeling, correctly identify the chemical principles.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** The molecule is a derivative of benzene.\n*   **Substituents:** It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because existing groups on the ring direct where new groups will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is added via Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**. It is added via Halogenation.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**. It is added via Nitration.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reactions (Acylation):** These reactions are crucial for adding the acetyl group. However, they **fail** on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\nA successful synthesis for a 1,3,5-pattern should ideally start by introducing a *meta*-director.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it introduces a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial synthesis.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Bromination):** Forms bromobenzene, which has an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Nitration):** Forms a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-bromonitrobenzene. This does not create the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    3.  **Step iii (Acylation):** This Friedel-Crafts reaction would **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  **Steps i-iv:** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) starts with benzene and ends with benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless and illogical loop.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  **Steps i & ii:** Forms aniline.\n    2.  **Step iii (Acylation):** This Friedel-Crafts reaction would **fail** because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, only sequence A provides a chemically viable and logical pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the target molecule with the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Goal**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemistry of the Substituents**\n\nThe order of the reactions is critical. We must consider the directing effects of each group in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and any reaction constraints.\n\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n*   **Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group). It also fails on rings with an amino group (-NH₂), as the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical approach is to first install a *meta*-director.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Adding the acetyl group first (Benzene → Acetophenone) is an excellent strategy. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, setting the stage for the 1,3,5-pattern.\n2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site for substitution, yielding the target molecule.\n\nThis sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the only chemically sound pathway to the desired product in high yield.\n\n**4. Match the Strategy to the Given Options**\n\nLet's analyze the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the optimal strategy: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial synthesis. **This is the correct pathway.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless and inefficient loop. **This is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The next step (nitration) would lead to a 1,4- or 1,2-product, which is the wrong regiochemistry. Furthermore, the final acylation step would fail on a ring strongly deactivated by a nitro group. **This is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence creates aniline (steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline. **This is incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll the provided candidate answers, despite sometimes having different letter assignments for the options, correctly identify that the sequence Acylation → Bromination → Nitration is the only viable route. Based on the options presented in the problem description, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This name indicates a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key structural feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct incoming substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Optimal Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Reacting benzene with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) introduces the acetyl group, forming acetophenone. This is an excellent first step because the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, setting up the correct orientation for the next substitution.\n2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The acetophenone is then brominated (Br₂/FeBr₃). The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone and establishing the required 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The final step is the nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This reaction successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe correct sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the provided options.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would lead to the wrong isomers (1,2- and 1,4-products). Furthermore, the final acylation step would fail on the strongly deactivated ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence perfectly matches the optimal pathway determined above:\n    *   i) Acylation\n    *   ii) Bromination\n    *   iii) Nitration\n    The first three steps produce the desired molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis. This option is correct.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence is a pointless loop. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene back into benzene. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option C provides a chemically sound and logical route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe objective is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Positions:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* relationship, meaning all three groups are meta to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of the reactions is critical because the substituent already on the ring directs the position of the next incoming group during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Potential Synthetic Pathways\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation:**\n    1.  **Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This is an excellent first step. The acetyl group is a meta-director, setting up the correct orientation for the next substitution.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The meta-directing acetyl group guides the bromine to the 3-position, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable, leading to the desired product in high yield.\n    *   This sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is chemically sound.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination:** This would place an ortho, para-director on the ring first, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, which is the incorrect pattern.\n\n*   **Starting with Nitration:** This places a strong meta-director on the ring. However, a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is too strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n\n*   **Routes involving Aniline:** Any sequence that forms aniline (e.g., nitration followed by reduction) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation will fail. The basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction.\n\n### 4. Matching the Correct Pathway to the Given Options\n\nWe must find the option that matches the correct sequence: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n*   **Option A:** Begins with a nonsensical loop that converts benzene back to benzene. Incorrect.\n*   **Option B:** Begins with bromination, leading to incorrect regiochemistry. Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Begins with nitration and reduction to aniline, followed by a Friedel-Crafts acylation which fails. Incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** The first three steps are: **i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Acylation) ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination) ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration)**. This perfectly matches the valid synthetic pathway identified above. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial sequence correctly and efficiently leads to the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only chemically viable route to the target molecule among the choices is presented in the first three steps of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe desired product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Ring:** Benzene.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-relationship between the substituents. All three groups are positioned *meta* to each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is critical. The directing effects of the substituents determine the position of subsequent additions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction Feasibility**\n\nCertain reactions have specific limitations:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those containing a -NO₂ group) and on rings with an amino group (-NH₂), as the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe optimal strategy to create a 1,3,5-pattern is to first install a *meta*-directing group. Let's evaluate each option based on this principle and the reaction constraints.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  Steps (i) and (ii) convert benzene to aniline.\n    2.  Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  This sequence involves nitration (i), reduction (ii), diazotization (iii), and deamination (iv). This series of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless and inefficient loop. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  Step (i) forms bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  Step (ii), nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    3.  Furthermore, step (iii), Friedel-Crafts acylation, would **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is the correct first step, as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step (ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step (iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that options A, B, and C contain chemically unfeasible or illogical steps. Only option D outlines a correct and logical pathway in its first three steps to synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in the option (iv-vii) are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been formed, but the initial sequence is the only one that works.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is a benzene ring.\n*   There are three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Formulate a Logical Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to first install a *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction adds the acetyl group. It is an excellent first step because the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which will guide subsequent substituents to the correct positions. Friedel-Crafts reactions also fail on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) or rings with basic groups (e.g., aniline), making it essential to perform this step early.\n*   **Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** Adds the bromo group.\n*   **Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** Adds the nitro group.\n\nThe most logical sequence is:\n1.  **Acylation:** Start with benzene and add the acetyl group to form acetophenone. This establishes a *meta*-director on the ring.\n2.  **Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4.

This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield the wrong isomers (1,2- and 1,4-products), not the required 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, the final acylation step would **fail** on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    The first four steps of this sequence convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene via deamination.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   At position 1: An acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   At position 3: A bromo group (-Br).\n    *   At position 5: A nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct where new groups will be added during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Analyze Key Reaction Constraints**\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction is essential for adding the acetyl group. However, it **fails** on strongly deactivated rings (like those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's analyze the reaction sequence proposed in each option, starting from benzene.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**, which is necessary to build the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination. This series of reactions converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to **benzene**. This is a pointless and inefficient loop.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, forming bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, so the subsequent nitration would yield a 1,4- or 1,2-product, not the required 1,3-product. Furthermore, the final Friedel-Crafts acylation step would **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect due to both wrong regiochemistry and a failed reaction step.\n\n**Final Decision**\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically sound and viable pathway to synthesize the target molecule. The other options contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Goal:** Synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Chemical Principles**\n\nThe synthesis requires a sequence of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions. The order is critical and is governed by two main factors:\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n*   **Reaction Feasibility:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) and on rings with a basic amino group (-NH₂), as the catalyst complexes with the nitrogen.\n\n### **3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical approach is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Reacting benzene with `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃` forms acetophenone. This is the ideal first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the other *meta* position (C5). Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this correct strategy to the specific options provided. The extra steps (iv-vii) listed in the options are superfluous distractors; the core synthesis in the first three steps is what determines the correct choice.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. The next step (nitration) would lead to a 1,2 or 1,4 product, not the required 1,3,5 pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   The first three steps are: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. This perfectly matches the optimal synthetic strategy and successfully produces the target molecule. **Correct.**\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence (nitration → reduction → diazotization → deamination) is a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence creates aniline (steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group complexes with the AlCl₃ catalyst. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous chemical analysis, the only viable pathway is presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions in electrophilic aromatic substitution is critical. The directing effects of the substituents are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Determine the Optimal Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to introduce a *meta*-directing group first.\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Reacting benzene with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ forms acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reaction types is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided in the question against this optimal pathway.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline. The third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, **fails** because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, creating an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration would yield a 1,2 or 1,4-disubstituted product, which is the wrong regiochemistry for the final 1,3,5-pattern. Furthermore, the final acylation step would **fail** on a ring strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    The first three steps of this sequence are:\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    This perfectly matches the optimal synthetic route. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous as the target molecule has already been formed, but the initial pathway is correct and high-yield. This is the correct option.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere is a clear consensus in the chemical reasoning among all provided candidate answers: the only viable pathway is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. This sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option C. The other options contain chemically unfeasible steps or are illogical.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH₃)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of reactions is critical for achieving the correct substitution pattern. The directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Pathways\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to introduce a *meta*-directing group first.\n\n*   **Starting with Acylation (-COCH₃):** This is an excellent strategy. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and will guide the next two substituents into the correct positions.\n    1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.\n    2.  **Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Nitration:** In 3-bromoacetophenone, the acetyl group (at C1) directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group (at C3) is an *ortho, para*-director, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site of substitution. This pathway successfully yields the target molecule.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (-Br):** This is an incorrect strategy. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The second substituent would be added to the ortho or para position, leading to a 1,2- or 1,4-disubstituted product, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n*   **Starting with Nitration (-NO₂):** This strategy is not viable. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction would fail on the strongly deactivated nitrobenzene ring.\n\n### 4. Match the Correct Pathway to the Given Options\nBased on the analysis, the only viable synthetic route is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. We now check which option matches this sequence.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This starts with nitration. As discussed, a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation will fail. This option is incorrect.\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ...**: This starts with bromination, which leads to the wrong isomers. This option is incorrect.\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This sequence matches our valid pathway.\n    *   Step (i) is Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   Step (ii) is bromination at the meta position.\n    *   Step (iii) is nitration at the other meta position.\n    This sequence successfully produces the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, but the core synthesis is correct.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This sequence begins with a series of reactions (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) that convert benzene back into benzene, making it a pointless loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only chemically sound and logical sequence that leads to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is presented in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a first-principles chemical evaluation, the following step-by-step process determines the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe objective is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n\nThe key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of the reactions is critical because existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Reaction Feasibility and Strategy\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical strategy is to first introduce a *meta*-directing group. This will guide the subsequent substitutions into the correct positions. We must also consider key reaction limitations:\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) and on rings containing an amino group (-NH₂), as the catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's analyze each sequence as provided in the original question prompt:\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, yielding bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This 1,2 or 1,4-pattern cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product. Furthermore, the final acylation step would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination. This four-step process starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical loop. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence represents the only chemically sound pathway:\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is the ideal first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This leads to the desired target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The first three steps constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unanimous consensus among all candidate answers, and a rigorous chemical analysis, confirms that the only viable synthetic route is Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. Based on the options provided in the prompt, this sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1.
