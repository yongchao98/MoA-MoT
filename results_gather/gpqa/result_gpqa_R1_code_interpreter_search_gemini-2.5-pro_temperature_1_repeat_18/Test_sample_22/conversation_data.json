    "**1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: It consists of a benzene ring connected to an oxygen atom (a phenoxy group). The oxygen is also connected to a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group.\n    *   Numbering the side chain starting from the oxygen attachment point: Ph-O-CH₂(1)-C(CH₃)₂(2)-CH(3)=CH₂(4).\n    *   The key functional groups are an ether, a benzene ring, and an alkene (double bond).\n*   **Reactant 2:** Hydrogen Bromide (HBr).\n    *   HBr is a strong acid and will provide a proton (H⁺) and a bromide ion (Br⁻).\n*   **Overall Reaction:** The reaction involves an alkene and a strong acid, so an electrophilic addition of H⁺ to the double bond is the most likely initial step. The molecule also contains an activated aromatic ring (phenoxy group is activating) and an ether linkage.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Mechanism Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Protonation of the Alkene**\n    *   The H⁺ from HBr will add to the double bond. According to Markovnikov's rule, the proton adds to the carbon atom that already has more hydrogen atoms (the terminal CH₂) to form the more stable carbocation.\n    *   `Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ + H⁺ → Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃`\n    *   This creates a secondary carbocation at position 3 of the chain.\n\n*   **Step 2: Competing Pathways for the Carbocation**\n    *   The newly formed carbocation is electrophilic. It is also positioned near the electron-rich benzene ring. This sets up a competition between several possible follow-up reactions. The problem states two products are formed, which points towards two competing pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Intramolecular Cyclization (without rearrangement)**\n        *   The carbocation is an electrophile, and the phenoxy-activated benzene ring is a nucleophile. An intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation can occur. The ortho position of the benzene ring is sterically accessible.\n        *   The ortho-carbon of the benzene ring attacks the secondary carbocation.\n        *   Let's count the atoms that will form the new ring: `O(1)-CH₂(2)-C(CH₃)₂(3)-CH(CH₃)(4)` where the ring closes between C4 and the aromatic ring. This forms a stable 6-membered ring fused to the benzene ring.\n        *   The final step is the loss of a proton from the aromatic ring to restore aromaticity.\n        *   The resulting product is a chromane derivative. The substituents are two methyl groups at position 3 and one methyl group at position 4.\n        *   **Product 1: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane.**\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Rearrangement followed by Intramolecular Cyclization**\n        *   Carbocations can rearrange to form more stable carbocations. The initial secondary carbocation `Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃` can undergo a 1,2-methyl shift. One of the methyl groups from the adjacent quaternary carbon (C2) moves to the carbocation center (C3).\n        *   `Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃ → Ph-O-CH₂-C⁺(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂`\n        *   This rearrangement converts the secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n        *   Now, this new tertiary carbocation undergoes intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The ortho-carbon of the benzene ring attacks the tertiary carbocation.\n        *   Let's count the atoms for this ring: `O(1)-CH₂(2)-C(CH₃)(isopropyl)(3)` where the ring closes between C3 and the aromatic ring. This forms a stable 5-membered ring fused to the benzene ring.\n        *   After loss of a proton to restore aromaticity, the product is a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivative. The substituents at position 3 are a methyl group and an isopropyl group.\n        *   **Product 2: 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene:** The first product is from an anti-Markovnikov addition, which is unlikely. The second product's formation is not straightforward.\n*   **B) 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol:** These would be products of a Claisen rearrangement, which is a thermal process and does not apply to this type of ether (it's not an allyl ether).\n*   **C) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene:** This option suggests a mix of anti-Markovnikov and Markovnikov addition of HBr across the double bond. While the Markovnikov product is plausible, the anti-Markovnikov product is not favored. This option ignores the highly probable intramolecular cyclization pathways.\n*   **D) 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran:** These are precisely the two products predicted from the two competing intramolecular cyclization pathways: one from the initial secondary carbocation and the other from the rearranged, more stable tertiary carbocation. This is the most mechanistically sound explanation for the formation of two products.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via protonation of the alkene to form a carbocation, which then undergoes two competing intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution (Friedel-Crafts alkylation) reactions. One pathway leads to a 6-membered ring product (a chromane), and the other involves a carbocation rearrangement followed by cyclization to a 5-membered ring product (a dihydrobenzofuran).\n\n<<<D>>>"
