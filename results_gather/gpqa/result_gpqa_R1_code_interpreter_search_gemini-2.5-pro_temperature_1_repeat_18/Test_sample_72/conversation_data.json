    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves two key concepts from special relativity:\n*   **Relativistic Velocity Addition/Subtraction:** When dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't simply add or subtract velocities. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a moving object is not just its kinetic energy but includes its rest energy. The formula for the total energy (E) is E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**2. Define the Given Variables**\n\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nBoth astronauts are moving in the same direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Part A: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the speed of astronaut 1 relative to astronaut 2 (or vice versa), we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)`\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula:\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c`\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut.\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n\nThe formula for the total energy of a single particle is:\n`E = γmc²`, where the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy of astronaut 1 (E1)**\n\n*   `m1 = 2m`\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 1 (γ1):\n`γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n\nNow, calculate E1:\n`E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the energy of astronaut 2 (E2)**\n\n*   `m2 = 3m`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 (γ2):\n`γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n\nNow, calculate E2:\n`E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total energy (E_total)**\n\n`E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `E_total = 5.96 mc²`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have calculated:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
