    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond or ring. The C=O bond of an aldehyde would account for this.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3), indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. The chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (1+1=2), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure: **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (ethanal part) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n    ```\n        H2N-Ph-CH2-CHO  (where Ph is a 1,4-phenylene ring)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is a classic **diazotization reaction**. It converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   The -NH2 group is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    *   **Intermediate A:** 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride\n    ```\n        [Cl⁻][⁺N≡N]-Ph-CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O, Heat**\n    *   This reaction is the **hydrolysis of a diazonium salt**. When the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt is warmed, the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   **Intermediate B:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n    ```\n        HO-Ph-CH2-CHO\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting an aldehyde (Intermediate B) that has α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**. Since only one type of aldehyde is present, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n    *   **a) Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   **Aldol Adduct:** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        ```\n                  OH\n                  |\n           HO-Ph-CH(CHO)-CH-CH2-Ph-OH\n        ```\n        *(This is the structure of option C)*\n\n    *   **b) Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The acidic hydrogen on the carbon α to the aldehyde (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are eliminated.\n        *   **Final Product:** The dehydration leads to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n                 (Heat, -H₂O)\n           [Adduct from above]   -------->   HO-Ph-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-Ph-OH\n        ```\n        *   Let's name this final product: The parent chain is a butenal. The double bond is at C2 (`but-2-enal`). There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, one at C2 and one at C4.\n        *   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire reaction sequence. The inclusion of \"Heat\" in the final step indicates that the reaction proceeds to the thermodynamically more stable condensation product, not stopping at the aldol addition stage. Therefore, the final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration.\n\n*   Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   After Diazotization/Hydrolysis: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n*   After Aldol Condensation (with heat): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
