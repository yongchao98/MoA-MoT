    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the biological context.**\n    *   The experiment is performed on *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast).\n    *   The yeast is treated with a peptide that causes the formation of a \"shmoo\". In yeast, shmoo formation is a response to mating pheromones.\n    *   A key feature of the mating pheromone response is that the cell cycle is arrested in the **G1 phase**. This is to ensure that both haploid cells are at the same cell cycle stage before they fuse.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the experimental technique.**\n    *   The technique is Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry.\n    *   ChIP is used to isolate specific regions of chromatin along with the proteins bound to them.\n    *   The goal is to specifically recover the proteome of **active chromatin**. Active chromatin (euchromatin) is characterized by being open, accessible, and typically undergoing active gene transcription. The ChIP would likely use antibodies against markers of active chromatin, such as acetylated histones (e.g., H3K9ac) or methylated histones (e.g., H3K4me3).\n    *   Mass spectrometry will then identify all the proteins that were pulled down with the active chromatin.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate each protein complex in the context of a G1-arrested, shmooing yeast cell and its association with active chromatin.**\n    *   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC, which includes RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles on gene promoters to start transcription. Shmoo formation requires the transcription of many new genes (e.g., those involved in cell fusion). Therefore, PICs will be abundant on these actively transcribed genes, which are the primary components of active chromatin. We would expect to observe a high amount of these proteins.\n    *   **B) Nucleosome histone complex:** Histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) are the fundamental protein components of all chromatin, both active and inactive. Since the experiment is a *chromatin* immunoprecipitation, histones will be one of the most abundant protein types recovered. They are essential and will be observed in high amounts.\n    *   **D) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA regions that bind activator proteins to increase the transcription of target genes. Since shmoo formation involves a significant change in the gene expression program, many genes will be activated. These enhancer-binding proteins are key to this activation and are hallmarks of active chromatin. We would expect to observe them.\n    *   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase. Its purpose is to \"license\" these origins, making them competent for DNA replication in the subsequent S phase. The shmooing cell is arrested in G1, so pre-RCs *will* be assembled on the chromatin at origins of replication. However, the cell is *arrested* and will not enter S phase to begin replication. The primary cellular activity is transcription for mating, not preparation for cell division. While origins must be in a somewhat open chromatin state to allow pre-RC binding, they are not the main sites of the *active transcription* that defines the bulk of \"active chromatin\" in this physiological state. Compared to the complexes directly involved in the ongoing, massive transcriptional program (PICs and enhancer complexes), the pre-RC is associated with a different, inhibited cellular process (replication). Therefore, in an assay designed to enrich for the proteome of *transcriptionally* active chromatin, the pre-RC would be the least represented complex.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The pre-replication complex is associated with a cellular process (DNA replication) that is inhibited during the G1 arrest of shmoo formation. The other complexes are all directly involved in active gene transcription, which is the dominant process occurring in the active chromatin of a shmooing cell. Therefore, the pre-replication complex proteins will be the least observed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
