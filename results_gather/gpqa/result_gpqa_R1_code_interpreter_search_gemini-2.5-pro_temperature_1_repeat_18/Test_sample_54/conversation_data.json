    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **Signal 1:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 2:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n*   **Signal 3:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 4:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n\n**2. Interpret Each Signal**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), such as in an acetate (CH₃COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** The singlet indicates that these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of an acetate group in the molecule. All four possible answers are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Analyze the Remaining Protons**\n    *   The remaining signals at 1.6 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 7.0 ppm account for 3H + 1H + 1H = 5 protons.\n    *   This group of 5 protons must belong to the \"alkenyl\" part of the \"alkenyl acetate\" molecule.\n    *   Let's check the number of protons on the alkenyl chains of the proposed structures:\n        *   **Propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃): This has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This **matches** our data.\n        *   **Butenyl group** (e.g., -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃ or -CH₂-CH=CH-CH₃): Both common butenyl isomers have 7 protons. This **does not match** our data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Based on the total proton count, the molecule must be a **propenyl acetate**, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The stereochemistry of the double bond can be determined by the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (the protons directly attached to the C=C double bond).\n\n*   **Let's analyze the vinylic proton signals:**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm** and **5.5 ppm** both represent one proton (1H), which is consistent with the two vinylic protons in a propenyl group (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   This is one of the vinylic protons. It is a doublet (d), meaning it is split by one adjacent proton (the other vinylic proton).\n        *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Applying the Rules for Vinylic Coupling:**\n    *   The coupling constant between two protons on opposite sides of a double bond (**trans**) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   The coupling constant between two protons on the same side of a double bond (**cis**) is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the observed coupling constant is **16.0 Hz**, it falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Confirmation of the Structure**\n\nLet's assemble the entire structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate** and see if all the data fits.\n\n*   **Structure:** CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d) (with H(b) and H(c) in a trans arrangement).\n    *   **CH₃(a):** Acetate methyl. Corresponds to **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH₃(d):** Vinylic methyl group. It is adjacent to one proton, H(c), so it should be a doublet (d). This corresponds to **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH(c):** Vinylic proton. It is adjacent to H(b) (1 proton) and the methyl group CH₃(d) (3 protons). It should be split into a doublet by H(b) and a quartet by CH₃(d), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH(b):** Vinylic proton next to the ester oxygen. It is adjacent only to H(c), so it should be a doublet (d). The coupling constant should be large and trans (~16.0 Hz). This corresponds to **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**. Correct.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
