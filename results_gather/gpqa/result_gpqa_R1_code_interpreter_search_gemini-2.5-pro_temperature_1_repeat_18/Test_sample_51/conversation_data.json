    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels in a system under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels (level 2 and level 1) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n    \n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    \n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the plasma.\n    \n2.  **Define the two states:** We need to calculate this ratio for two different temperatures:\n    *   State 1 (No spots): T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   State 2 (With spots): T_spots = 5500 K\n    \n    The ratio in each state is:\n    *   R_nospots = (N₂ / N₁)_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n    *   R_spots = (N₂ / N₁)_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n    \n3.  **Determine the required factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of the two ratios:\n    \n    Factor = R_nospots / R_spots\n    \n    Substituting the expressions from step 2:\n    \n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n    \n    The statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancel out:\n    \n    Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n    \n    Using the properties of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n    \n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n    \n4.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** The energy difference is related to the wavelength (λ) of the photon emitted or absorbed during the transition by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n    \n    ΔE = h * c / λ\n    \n    where:\n    *   h is the Planck constant.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n    \n5.  **Substitute and calculate:** We can now substitute the expression for ΔE into the factor equation:\n    \n    Factor = exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n    \n    We will use a Python script to perform this calculation accurately, using the following values:\n    *   h = 6.62607015 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c = 299792458 m/s\n    *   k = 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nThe information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is contextual but not directly needed for the calculation, as the resulting effective temperatures are provided.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given values\nlambda_nm = 144.8  # Wavelength in nm\nlambda_m = lambda_nm * 1e-9  # Convert wavelength to meters\n\nT_nospots = 6000  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spots = 5500    # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (Delta E)\ndelta_E = h * c / lambda_m\n\n# Calculate the exponent term: (delta_E / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (N₂/N₁) changes when the star's surface temperature drops from 6000 K (no spots) to 5500 K (with spots).\n\n### Governing Principles\n\nUnder the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in different energy states is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the upper (level 2) and lower (level 1) energy states, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two levels. The ratio (g₂ / g₁) is a constant for a given transition.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe energy difference ΔE can be calculated from the wavelength (λ) of the corresponding transition using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s).\n*   λ is the wavelength of the transition (1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Define the ratios for both temperature states:**\n    *   Let R_nospots be the ratio when T = T_nospots = 6000 K.\n        R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n    *   Let R_spots be the ratio when T = T_spots = 5500 K.\n        R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n2.  **Determine the factor:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is R_nospots / R_spots.\n\n    Factor = R_nospots / R_spots\n    \n    Factor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression:** The (g₂ / g₁) term cancels out. Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)), we get:\n\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n    \n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n4.  **Substitute ΔE:** Now substitute the expression for ΔE:\n\n    Factor = exp[ (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n5.  **Plug in the values and compute:**\n    *   h = 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c = 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   k = 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\n    Let's calculate the value of the exponent first:\n    *   (h * c / (λ * k)) = ( (6.626e-34 * 2.998e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.381e-23) ) ≈ 99368 K\n    *   (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) ≈ 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹\n    *   Exponent ≈ 99368 * 1.515 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ 1.505\n\n    Factor = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.50\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script provides a more precise result: **4.506**.\n\nThis value corresponds to approximately **4.5**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
