    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reaction and Given Information\nThe annihilation process is:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   The antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. For simplicity, we can assume both the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) are at rest before the annihilation. This sets up the problem in the center-of-mass frame.\n*   The rest mass energy of particle A is $m_{A}c^{2}=300$ MeV.\n\nWe also need the rest mass energy of a proton, which is the same as that of an antiproton.\n*   $m_{p}c^{2} = m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n\n### 2. Apply Conservation Laws\nWe will apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n#### a) Initial State (Before Annihilation)\n*   **Energy ($E_{initial}$):** Since we assume both the proton and antiproton are at rest, their energy is purely their rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 2 m_{p}c^{2}$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Momentum ($\\vec{P}_{initial}$):** Since both particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    $\\vec{P}_{initial} = 0$\n\n#### b) Final State (After Annihilation)\n*   **Energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state consists of four particles (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$). They all have the same mass $m_A$. Due to the conservation of momentum (explained next), they must all be created with the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula:\n    $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n*   **Momentum ($\\vec{P}_{final}$):** According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must equal the total initial momentum.\n    $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{P}_{initial} = 0$\n    This means the vector sum of the momenta of the four final particles must be zero. They will fly off in different directions that cancel each other out.\n\n### 3. Equate Initial and Final Energy\nBy the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$2 m_{p}c^{2} = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Velocity (v)\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_{p}c^{2}}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_{p}c^{2}}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $v/c$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe calculated velocity is $v \\approx 0.77c$, which corresponds to option C.\n\nTo perform the calculation with higher precision:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27208816  # Proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300           # Particle A rest mass energy in MeV\n\n# Conservation of energy: 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for velocity v in terms of c\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) => (v/c) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {v_over_c:.2f}c\")\n```\n> **Execution Output:**\n> The velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The reasoning and thinking process has been generated, and the final answer is confirmed by the calculation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principles:** The problem involves a particle annihilation process. The fundamental principles to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles will likely be moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in physics problems, implying that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can therefore assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** With the particles at rest, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies. A proton and an antiproton have the same rest mass.\n        *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n        *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Initial Momentum ($\\vec{P}_{initial}$):** Since both particles are considered at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n        *   $\\vec{P}_{initial} = 0$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We assume $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass.\n    *   **Final Momentum ($\\vec{P}_{final}$):** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must equal the total initial momentum.\n        *   $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{P}_{initial} = 0$.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total initial energy is converted into the total final energy of the four A particles. This energy includes their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.\n        *   The total energy of a single moving particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n        *   Due to the conservation of momentum (totaling zero) and the equal distribution of energy among identical particles, all four A particles will be produced with the same speed $v$, and thus the same energy $E_A$.\n        *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v$):**\n    *   First, we solve the energy equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the numerical values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Since $\\beta = v/c$, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated velocity $v \\approx 0.77c$ matches option C.\n\nThe previously executed python code confirmed this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# Using the standard value for proton rest mass energy in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272 \nm_A_c2 = 300           \n\n# From conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# We can solve for v/c (beta): beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\n# The output from this calculation was v_over_c ≈ 0.77\n# print(f\"The velocity of particle A is {v_over_c:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe result is consistent and the reasoning is sound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
