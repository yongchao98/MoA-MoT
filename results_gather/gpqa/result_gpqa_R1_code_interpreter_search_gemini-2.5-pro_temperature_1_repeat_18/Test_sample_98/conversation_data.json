    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹: This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹: This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms we are on the right track but doesn't distinguish between them.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   No vinyl-hydrogens: This means there are no protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n        *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This tells us about the neighbors of a specific proton. For a signal to be a `dtq`, the proton must be coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n            *   One neighboring proton (gives the `d` for doublet, n+1=2 -> n=1).\n            *   Two neighboring protons (gives the `t` for triplet, n+1=3 -> n=2).\n            *   Three neighboring protons (gives the `q` for quartet, n+1=4 -> n=3).\n            *   So, we are looking for a proton with 1H, 2H, and 3H as neighbors. The order (`d`, `t`, `q`) depends on the relative size of the coupling constants (J-values), but the set of neighbors is fixed.\n        *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** Using the same logic:\n            *   One neighboring proton (`d`).\n            *   Two neighboring protons (`t`).\n            *   Another two neighboring protons (`t`).\n            *   So, we are looking for a proton with 1H, 2H, and 2H as neighbors.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Proposed Structure**\n\n    The core of the problem is to see which of the four molecules has protons that match *both* of these complex splitting patterns. We need to draw each structure and analyze the environment of each unique proton (specifically the methine, -CH-, protons as they are most likely to have many different neighbors).\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH(Et)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   Let's analyze H at C3: `...-CH(2)-CH(3)-CH₂(4)-...` and an ethyl group on C3. Its neighbors are: H at C2 (1H), the `CH₂` of the attached ethyl group (2H), and the `CH₂` at C4 (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H. This matches the requirement for the **dtt** signal.\n        *   Let's look for a `dtq` (1H, 2H, 3H neighbors). H at C2 has neighbors H-C3 (1H) and `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H) -> `dt`. The `CH₂` protons in this molecule are diastereotopic and would give `ddq` signals (1H, 1H, 3H neighbors). So, structure A has the `dtt` but not the `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH(Me)(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   Let's analyze H at C3: Its neighbors are: H at C2 (1H), the `CH₃` group on C3 (3H), and the `CH₂` at C4 (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This matches the requirement for the **dtq** signal.\n        *   Let's look for a `dtt` (1H, 2H, 2H neighbors). No other proton in the molecule has this set of neighbors. H at C2 gives a `dq`. So, structure B has the `dtq` but not the `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH(Me)(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        *   H at C3: Neighbors are `CH₂` at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), `CH₃` on C3 (3H). This gives a `tdq`.\n        *   H at C4: Neighbors are H at C3 (1H), `CH₃` on C4 (3H), `CH₃` at C5 (3H). This gives a `dqq`.\n        *   This structure has neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        Let's draw this carefully:\n        `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(4)-CH₃(5)`\n        This is the correct connectivity based on the condensed formula.\n        Now, let's analyze the two different methine (-CH-) protons.\n        *   **Analyze H at C4:** `...-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₃(5)` and an ethyl group on C4. Its neighbors are: H at C3 (1H), the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H. This set of neighbors matches the requirement for the **dtq** signal.\n        *   **Analyze H at C3:** `...-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-...` and an ethyl group on C3. Its neighbors are: the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), and the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H).\n        *   Neighbors: 2H, 1H, 2H. This set of neighbors matches the requirement for the **dtt** signal (or more specifically, a `tdt`, but they arise from the same neighbor set of 1H, 2H, 2H).\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    Structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only compound that contains a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` (the proton at C4) AND another proton environment that would produce a `dtt` (the proton at C3). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
