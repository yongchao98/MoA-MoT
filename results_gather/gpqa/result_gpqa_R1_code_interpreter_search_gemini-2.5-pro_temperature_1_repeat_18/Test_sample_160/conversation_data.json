    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an ultra-high vacuum.\n    *   **Key Players:**\n        *   Residual gas molecules in the vacuum.\n        *   High-energy electrons (from a 1000 kV accelerating voltage) forming a beam.\n    *   **Two Scenarios & Mean Free Paths:**\n        *   **λ1:** The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This is determined by gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n        *   **λ2:** The mean free path of the electrons from the beam. This is determined by electrons scattering off the stationary gas molecules.\n    *   **Goal:** Compare λ1 and λ2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    *   The general formula for the mean free path (λ) of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n        λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n        *   `σ` is the scattering cross-section (the effective \"area\" the target presents for a collision).\n    *   A crucial detail from the kinetic theory of gases: When calculating the MFP of a gas molecule within its own gas (like for λ1), the target molecules are also moving. This constant motion increases the likelihood of collision compared to if the targets were stationary. To account for this, a factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced into the denominator.\n    *   Therefore, the two specific formulas we need are:\n        *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collision):** λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collision):** λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Components of the Formulas:**\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The problem states the conditions inside the sample compartment (pressure, temperature, volume) remain the same. Therefore, the number density `n` of the gas molecules is constant for both calculations.\n    *   **Velocity Factor (`√2`):**\n        *   For λ1, the target gas molecules are moving with thermal velocities, similar to the probe molecule. The `√2` factor is necessary.\n        *   For λ2, the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV. Their speed is extremely high (relativistic, near the speed of light). The thermal velocity of the gas molecules is negligible in comparison. Thus, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets. The `√2` factor is *not* present for λ2.\n    *   **Cross-Section (`σ`):** This is the most complex part, but we can analyze it using a simplified \"hard-sphere\" model.\n        *   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** Imagine two spherical gas molecules of diameter `d`. A collision occurs if their centers get closer than the distance `d`. The effective target area, or cross-section, is therefore σ_gg = π * d².\n        *   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** Now imagine a point-like electron (its physical size is negligible) approaching a spherical gas molecule of radius `r = d/2`. A collision occurs if the electron passes within the radius of the molecule. The effective target area is σ_eg = π * r² = π * (d/2)² = (π * d²) / 4.\n        *   **Comparing Cross-Sections:** From this model, we see that σ_eg = σ_gg / 4. The target area for an electron is four times smaller than the effective target area for another molecule.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Let's write down the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n    *   The `n` terms cancel out:\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n    *   Now substitute the relationship we found for the cross-sections (σ_eg = σ_gg / 4):\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / (σ_gg / 4)\n    *   The σ_gg terms cancel out:\n        λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n    *   Calculate the numerical value: √2 is approximately 1.414.\n        λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n    *   This means λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\n5.  **Alternative Simplified Approach:**\n    *   What if the question intends for an even simpler model where we ignore the difference in cross-section size and assume σ_gg ≈ σ_eg? This isolates the effect of the target motion.\n    *   In this case, the ratio would be:\n        λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg ≈ √2 ≈ 1.414.\n    *   So, under this simplification, λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The options are:\n        A) λ2 = λ1\n        B) λ2 < λ1\n        C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n        D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n    *   Our first, more detailed calculation gave λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1. This satisfies option D, as 5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    *   Our second, simplified calculation gave λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1. This also satisfies option D, as 1.414 is greater than 1.22.\n    *   Both plausible physical models lead to the same conclusion. The mean free path for the electron (λ2) is larger than the mean free path for a gas molecule (λ1). The factor is at least √2, which is greater than 1.22.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The physical reasoning robustly supports the conclusion that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of at least √2. Therefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
