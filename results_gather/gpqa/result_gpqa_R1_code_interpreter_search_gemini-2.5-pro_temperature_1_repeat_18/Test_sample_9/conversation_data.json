    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the baseline: Option (a)**\n    *   This describes a planet identical to Earth in mass and size.\n    *   Earth's average density is a standard value, approximately 5.51 g/cm³. We will use this as our reference point.\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option (b)**\n    *   This planet has a mass of 2 Earth masses.\n    *   Its density is explicitly given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   This density is very close to Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option (c) and the effect of increased mass**\n    *   This planet has the same composition as Earth (e.g., a similar ratio of iron, silicon, oxygen, etc.) but is 5 times more massive.\n    *   The key principle here is **gravitational compression**. As the mass of a planet increases, its gravitational pull on itself becomes much stronger.\n    *   This immense internal pressure squeezes the constituent materials (rock and metal), forcing the atoms closer together.\n    *   This compression results in a higher overall density. A 5-Earth-mass rocky planet (a \"Super-Earth\") will be significantly denser than Earth.\n    *   Therefore, the density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option (d) and the effect of decreased mass**\n    *   This planet also has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive.\n    *   The principle of gravitational compression works in reverse here.\n    *   With less mass, the planet's self-gravity is weaker. The internal materials are not compressed as much as they are inside Earth.\n    *   This lack of compression means the average density will be lower than Earth's.\n    *   Therefore, the density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n5.  **Compare all options**\n    *   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n    *   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nBased on this comparison, the planet with 5 times the mass of Earth (c) will be the most compressed by its own gravity and will therefore have the highest density.\n\nTo illustrate with a calculation using a common mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, R ∝ M^0.28 (where R is radius and M is mass):\n*   Density (ρ) is proportional to M/R³.\n*   For planet (c): Mass is 5 times Earth's mass. The radius would be roughly (5)^0.28 ≈ 1.6 times Earth's radius.\n*   The density would be proportional to 5 / (1.6)³ ≈ 5 / 4.1 ≈ 1.22 times Earth's density. This confirms it is significantly denser.\n\n<<<C>>>"
