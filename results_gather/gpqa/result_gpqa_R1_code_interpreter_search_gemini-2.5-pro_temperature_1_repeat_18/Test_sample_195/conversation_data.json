    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    For an isolated system, the total energy is conserved. In this case, the system consists of the mass and the \"spring\" (the source of the potential field). The total energy of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\n2.  **Define the components of the total energy.**\n    *   **Relativistic Energy of the Mass:** The total energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light. This energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the relativistic kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   **Potential Energy of the Spring:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with this force is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where we set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n3.  **Formulate the energy conservation equation.**\n    The total energy of the system, $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, must be constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    The mass reaches its maximum amplitude at $x = A$. At this turning point, the velocity of the mass is momentarily zero ($v=0$).\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the total energy at the point of maximum speed.**\n    The mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x=0$.\n    *   At $x=0$, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The velocity is $v = v_{max}$. The corresponding Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n6.  **Apply energy conservation and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, we can equate the expressions for the total energy from steps 4 and 5:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we just found:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    Invert both sides to solve for the term containing $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$ by multiplying by $c^2$ and taking the square root:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
