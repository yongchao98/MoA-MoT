    "The user wants to find the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function.\n\n1.  **State the problem:** We are given a wave function `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i` for a particle that exists only in the region `1 ≤ x ≤ 3`. We need to find the value of the constant 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall the normalization condition:** In quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in the space where it can exist must be equal to 1. This is expressed by the normalization condition:\n    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    where the integral is taken over all space where the particle can be found.\n\n3.  **Determine the probability density function |ψ(x)|²:**\n    The probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function. A complex number `z = R + iI` has a modulus squared of `|z|² = R² + I²`.\n    For our wave function, `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i`:\n    *   The real part is `Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n    *   The imaginary part is `Im(ψ) = -0.5`\n    Therefore, the probability density is:\n    |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²\n    |ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n4.  **Set up the normalization integral:**\n    We are told the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So, we must integrate the probability density function over this interval and set it equal to 1.\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n5.  **Solve the integral:**\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **First part:**\n        ∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln|1 + x|\n        Evaluating from 1 to 3:\n        a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Second part:**\n        ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * x\n        Evaluating from 1 to 3:\n        0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n6.  **Combine the results and solve for 'a':**\n    The result of the integral is `a² * ln(2) + 0.5`. We set this equal to 1:\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    We can use a calculator or a simple script to find the value of 'a'.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\na_squared = 0.5 / math.log(2)\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(a)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.8493269620942436\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated value of `a` is approximately 0.8493.\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 1.1\n    B) 0.6\n    C) 0.85\n    D) 0.35\n\nThe calculated value `a ≈ 0.8493` is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>",
