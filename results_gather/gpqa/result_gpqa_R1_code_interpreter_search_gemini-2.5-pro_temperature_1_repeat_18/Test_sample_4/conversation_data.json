    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n**1. Define the Operator and Direction Vector**\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ is given by its components, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThis is the spin angular momentum operator, $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in spherical coordinates is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, which means we can set the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\nSo, the unit vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**2. Construct the Operator Along Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator representing the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\nSubstituting the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set Up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nLet the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Eigenvector**\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the relationship between `a` and `b`:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$b = a \\left( \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} \\right)$\n\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `b`:\n$b = a \\left( \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\right) = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo the eigenvector has the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nTo find the normalized eigenvector, we can choose a convenient value for `a`. Let's choose $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ where C is the normalization constant.\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\end{pmatrix} = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\left( C^* (\\cos(\\theta/2) \\quad \\sin(\\theta/2)) \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1$\n\nChoosing the simplest normalization constant, $C=1$.\nThe normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
