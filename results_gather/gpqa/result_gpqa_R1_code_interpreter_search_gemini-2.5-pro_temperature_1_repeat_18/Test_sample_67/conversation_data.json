    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction. The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B = -μ_z * B = -γ * S_z * B`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, `E_up` is the lower energy.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this state is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian for Time Evolution:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ · B = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B`. This Hamiltonian will govern the time evolution of the state.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)>` at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the Hamiltonian `H = -γB S_y`:\n        `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) = exp(iγBtS_y / ħ)`\n    *   We need the matrix representation of `S_y` in the `S_z` basis: `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]` is the Pauli Y matrix.\n    *   `U(t) = exp(iγBt * (ħ/2)σ_y / ħ) = exp(i(γBt/2)σ_y)`\n    *   Let's define `θ = γBt/2`. The operator becomes `U(t) = exp(iθσ_y)`.\n    *   Using the identity `exp(iaσ_k) = cos(a)I + i sin(a)σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix:\n        `U(t) = cos(θ)I + i sin(θ)σ_y`\n        `U(t) = cos(θ)[[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i sin(θ)[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(θ), 0], [0, cos(θ)]] + [[0, sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), 0]]`\n        `U(t) = [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), cos(θ)]]`\n    *   Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = [[cos(θ), sin(θ)], [-sin(θ), cos(θ)]] * [1, 0]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [cos(θ), -sin(θ)]` (as a column vector).\n        In ket notation, this is `|ψ(t)> = cos(θ)|+z> - sin(θ)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the z-Component of the Moment:**\n    *   We want to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equal to `γ<S_z(t)>`, where `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<S_z(t)>`. The operator `S_z` in its own basis is `S_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   The bra `<ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)>`, which is `[cos(θ), -sin(θ)]` (as a row vector).\n    *   `<S_z(t)> = [cos(θ), -sin(θ)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(θ), -sin(θ)]`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos(θ), -sin(θ)] * [cos(θ), sin(θ)]`\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * (cos²(θ) - sin²(θ))`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2θ)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   Now, substitute back the expression for `θ = γBt/2`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * (γBt/2)) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. A general oscillation is written as `A*cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` precesses around the applied magnetic field `B` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`, called the Larmor frequency. The projection of this precessing vector onto any fixed axis (like the z-axis) will oscillate at this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
