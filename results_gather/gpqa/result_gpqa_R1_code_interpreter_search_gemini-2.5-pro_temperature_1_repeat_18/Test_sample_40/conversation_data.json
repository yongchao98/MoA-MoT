    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving with the glass. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving at velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the moving glass (frame S'). By definition, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as the glass's motion.\n    *   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Since the speeds involved can be significant, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, not the simple Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`). The formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
