    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Data (Functional Groups):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structure of the compound:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to it.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen (from the carbonyl group).\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for a 2-carbon, carbonyl-containing substituent:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common and stable functional group. The resulting molecule would be a **halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3)**.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The resulting molecule would be a **halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the possible structures and compare with the given options.**\n    The substitution pattern on the benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The simplest and most symmetrical pattern is para-substitution, which often results in two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as a doublet. Let's analyze the options to see if they fit this pattern.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Option A:** `1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)`\n        *   The aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) only shows a singlet for 1H. This is not consistent with a di-substituted ring, which should have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Option D:** `1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)`\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region. The problem explicitly states the compound has an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Options B and C:** Both options show two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 & 7.6 ppm), each integrating to 2H. This \"two-doublet, 2H each\" pattern is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) disubstituted benzene ring**. This suggests our compound is para-substituted.\n\n4.  **Detailed analysis of the two remaining plausible structures and their corresponding NMR options.**\n\n    *   **Structure 1: para-halo-acetophenone (matches Option B)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and an acetyl group (-COCH3) are at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) of the benzene ring.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. We expect two signals, each for 2H, appearing as doublets (an AA'BB' system). The electron-withdrawing acetyl group and halogen will shift these protons downfield (to a higher ppm value), typically in the 7.4-8.0 ppm range.\n            *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, not another carbon with protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Comparing with Option B:** `1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`\n            *   This matches our prediction perfectly. We have two 2H doublets in the aromatic region and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm.\n\n    *   **Structure 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (related to Option C)**\n        *   **Structure:** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group are at opposite ends of the ring.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Similar to above, we expect two 2H doublets.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This proton is adjacent to the -CH2- group. It should couple with the two CH2 protons and appear as a **triplet (t)** (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). Its chemical shift is very far downfield, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They should couple with it and appear as a **doublet (d)** (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). The chemical shift is typically around 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Comparing with Option C:** `1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`\n            *   This option has the correct types of protons (aldehyde, aromatic, methylene). However, the **splitting is incorrect**. It lists the aldehyde proton as a singlet (`s`) instead of a triplet (`t`), and the methylene protons as a singlet (`s`) instead of a doublet (`d`). This contradicts the rules of spin-spin coupling. Therefore, option C describes an impossible spectrum for this structure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a compound fitting the given criteria is B. The compound is a para-halo-acetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
