    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage relationship in a specific regime known as space-charge-limited current (SCLC). To determine which statement is true, we need to analyze the fundamental assumptions made in the derivation of this equation.\n\n1.  **Derivation Context:** The equation is derived by solving the Poisson equation and the drift current equation simultaneously, under a set of boundary conditions.\n    *   Poisson's Equation: $ \\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{qn(x)}{\\epsilon} $ (where E is the electric field, x is position, $\\rho$ is charge density, q is elementary charge, n(x) is the carrier concentration, and $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric permittivity).\n    *   Drift Current Equation: $ J = qn(x)\\mu E(x) $ (where J is the current density and $\\mu$ is the carrier mobility). Diffusion current ($J_{diff} = qD\\frac{dn}{dx}$) is ignored.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Assumptions:**\n    *   **Single-Carrier Device:** The derivation only considers one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) being injected and transported. The presence of a second carrier type would introduce recombination, which is not included in the basic Mott-Gurney model. Therefore, it must be a single-carrier device. This eliminates option (D).\n    *   **Trap-Free Solid:** The model assumes an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no electronic states (traps) in the bandgap. If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, reducing the free carrier concentration and thus the current. The J-V relationship would change. Therefore, the material must be considered trap-free. This is consistent with options (A) and (C).\n    *   **Contact Type / Injection:** For the current to be limited by the space charge in the bulk of the material (rather than by the contact itself), the injecting contact must be able to supply an unlimited number of carriers. This type of contact is called an \"Ohmic contact\" or a contact with \"no injection barrier\". The high concentration of injected carriers at the contact effectively pins the electric field to zero at that interface. A \"Schottky contact\" is a rectifying contact that typically forms an energy barrier, limiting carrier injection. Therefore, a Schottky contact is generally not assumed for the injecting electrode in the Mott-Gurney model. This eliminates option (B). The condition is \"Ohmic contact\" or \"no carrier injection barrier\".\n    *   **Dominant Transport Mechanism:** The model assumes that the current is driven by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current component arising from the diffusion of carriers (due to concentration gradients) is assumed to be negligible. This is a valid assumption for devices that are not too thin and under sufficiently high voltage. Therefore, the diffusion current must be negligible, and the drift current is the dominant mechanism.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the SCLC is fundamentally a **drift-dominated** current. Diffusion current is neglected, not drift current.\n    *   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact typically limits injection, whereas the model requires an Ohmic contact (unlimited injection).\n    *   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly identifies all the key assumptions: 1) trap-free, 2) single-carrier, 3) no injection barrier (which is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact for SCLC), and 4) negligible diffusion current.\n    *   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is a single-carrier model.\n\nConclusion: Statement C accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
