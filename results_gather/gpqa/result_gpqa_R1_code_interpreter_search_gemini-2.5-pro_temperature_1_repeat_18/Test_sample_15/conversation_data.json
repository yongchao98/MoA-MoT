    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and is present as a single enantiomer or in an enantiomerically enriched form. The naming conventions used in the question imply we are considering single, specific stereoisomers. Therefore, the question is equivalent to identifying which of the listed compounds are chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** To be chiral, a molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This usually requires a chiral center or another element of chirality (axial, planar, helical).\n    *   This molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups). The atoms around the C=C double bond lie in a plane. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane containing the double bond and the atoms directly attached to it). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex name for a bicyclic compound. The core `hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione` is a derivative of norbornane, specifically the saturated version of the Diels-Alder adduct between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. The parent molecule without the substituent is a meso compound (achiral) and has a plane of symmetry. The stereodescriptors `(3aR,7aS)` are consistent with a meso compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The substituent is `(E)-8-(chloromethylene)`, which means a `=C(H)Cl` group is attached to the C8 bridge carbon. This substituent lies on the plane of symmetry of the parent molecule. However, the substituent itself (`=C(H)Cl`) is not symmetric with respect to this plane. The presence of this substituent therefore destroys the plane of symmetry of the entire molecule. The desymmetrization of a meso compound results in a chiral molecule. Since the name specifies a single stereoisomer `(3aR,7aS,E)`, we are dealing with a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. (Note: While the chemical stability of this structure is questionable due to a double bond involving a bridge atom in a [2.2.1] system, we evaluate its chirality based on the provided name).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereoisomer is specified as `(2R,3S)`. When drawn, for example in a Fischer projection, this molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. This makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral due to internal compensation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R,3R)` stereoisomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the ring segment `-CH2-C3=`, and (4) the ring segment `-C6H2-C5=`. These four groups are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` designation indicates that all three OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule, whether in its all-axial or all-equatorial chair conformation, possesses elements of symmetry. Specifically, it has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H group across the ring. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though it contains stereogenic centers (it is a meso compound).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name describes a ketone. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is also on C1, and a methyl group is on C3. The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be seen as isopentyl cyclopentyl ketone, or more systematically, `1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's look for chiral centers. The only potential chiral center is C3 of the butane chain. The groups attached to C3 are: H, -CH3 (C4), -CH3 (the substituent), and `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other elements of chirality. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
