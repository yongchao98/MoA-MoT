    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy be the stationary reference frame, which we'll call S.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta be the moving reference frame, which we'll call S'.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame S') is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest in its own reference frame (the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in frame S is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a time `Δt'` in a moving frame (S').\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula `Δt = γ * Δt'`:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy Frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the distance formula `d = v * Δt`:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   To get a numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n\nLet's perform the final calculation using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s, speed of the ejecta\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s, time in the ejecta's frame (proper time)\nc = 300000 # km/s, speed of light\n\n# Calculate the ratio v/c\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance=}\")\n\n# Alternative check using binomial approximation for gamma\n# gamma approx 1 + 0.5 * beta^2\ngamma_approx = 1 + 0.5 * beta**2\ndistance_approx = v * (gamma_approx * delta_t_prime)\nprint(f\"{distance_approx=}\")\n\n```\n>>>\ndistance=3061862.178478728\ndistance_approx=3060000.0\n\nThe exact calculation gives `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`. Looking at the options, option B, `3,060,000 km`, is the closest. The small difference arises because the problem likely expects the use of the binomial approximation for the Lorentz factor when `v` is much smaller than `c`, which is a common practice in physics problems.\n\nUsing the approximation `γ ≈ 1 + v²/(2c²) = 1 + 0.04/2 = 1.02`:\n*   `Δt ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n*   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km`\n\nThis result matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference: the Galaxy (let's call it frame S) and the supernova ejecta (frame S').\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame S') is `Δt' = 50 s`.
