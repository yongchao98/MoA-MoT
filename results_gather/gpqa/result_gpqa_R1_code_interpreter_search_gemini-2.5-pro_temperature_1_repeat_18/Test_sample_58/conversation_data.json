    "This is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species and their properties:**\n*   `CH3COOH` (Acetic Acid): A weak acid.\n*   `HCl` (Hydrochloric Acid): A strong acid.\n*   `Ba(OH)2` (Barium Hydroxide): A strong base.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\nThe formula for moles is `Moles = Molarity (M) × Volume (L)`.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.05 moles of CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates: `HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻`.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 moles of HCl.\n    *   Therefore, there are **0.08 moles of H⁺**.\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates completely, releasing two hydroxide ions per molecule: `Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻`.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 moles.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 moles = **0.18 moles of OH⁻**.\n\n**3. Perform neutralization reactions:**\nThe neutralization reaction will occur in steps. The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻) first.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    *   `H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O`\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. All 0.08 moles of H⁺ will react with 0.08 moles of OH⁻.\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ remaining** = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base + Weak Acid**\n    *   The 0.10 moles of excess OH⁻ will now react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    *   `CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O`\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n    *   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH will be neutralized.\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ in excess** = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n**4. Determine the final composition and calculate the pH:**\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH⁻ ions. Since OH⁻ is a strong base, it will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH. The contribution from the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   We know that pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
