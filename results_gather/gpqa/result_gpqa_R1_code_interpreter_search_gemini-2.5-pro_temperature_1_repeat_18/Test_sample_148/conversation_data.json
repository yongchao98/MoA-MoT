    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental data provided.**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   The integrals are roughly equal, and their sum corresponds to one proton (1H).\n        *   The multiplicity is not due to standard spin-spin coupling.\n        This suggests the presence of two distinct chemical environments for the same proton, with the two corresponding molecular species being present in roughly equal amounts. The two species are very similar structurally, hence the similar chemical shifts.\n\n    2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   Analysis at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace.\n        *   The intensities of the two LC peaks are equal.\n        *   Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum (MS).\n        *   The mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n        This confirms the presence of two distinct chemical species in a 1:1 ratio. Because they can be separated by chromatography (LC), they must have different physical properties. The identical mass spectra confirm that they are isomers (they have the same chemical formula) and not an impurity like a precursor or a side-product with a different formula.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the given options against the analyzed data.**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because diastereoisomers are chemically distinct, their NMR spectra are different. A proton in one diastereomer is in a different chemical environment than the same proton in the other, leading to two different peaks. This is consistent with the NMR data.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. This would result in two peaks. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass, which is consistent with both LC peaks having the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Plausibility in Peptides:** This is a very common scenario in peptide chemistry. Two primary sources are:\n            1.  **Epimerization:** One of the chiral centers (the alpha-carbon of an amino acid) may have partially inverted its stereochemistry during a harsh coupling step, creating a diastereomer (e.g., a mix of L-L and L-D peptides).\n            2.  **Rotamers (Atropisomers):** The amide bond in a peptide has significant double-bond character, restricting rotation. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* conformations, which are a specific type of diastereomer called rotamers. These rotamers interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale at room temperature, giving rise to two sets of peaks. They can often be separated by LC as well. The presence of two species in roughly equal amounts is perfectly explained by either of these phenomena. This option is highly consistent with all observations.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This would create a molecule with a different chemical structure and a higher molecular weight than the expected product. The mass spectrum would be different, which contradicts the MS data. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce identical spectra. You would see only one set of peaks, not two. This contradicts the NMR data.\n        *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers have identical properties and co-elute as a single peak. This contradicts the LC data showing two peaks. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor (starting material) would have a different chemical formula and a different molecular weight. The mass spectrum would be different from the product's, contradicting the MS data that shows both peaks have the mass of the expected molecule. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the most likely explanation.**\n    Based on the analysis, the only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence (two NMR signals for one proton, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass spectra for both peaks corresponding to the target molecule) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
