    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O) or ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for an ester group. The frequency is slightly lower than a typical saturated ester (~1735-1750 cm-1), which suggests the C=O is conjugated with an aromatic ring. This conjugation weakens the C=O bond, lowering its stretching frequency.\n    *   **IR Summary:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester (-COO-).\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (likely a -CH3 group). The triplet multiplicity (t) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (-CH2-). This is the upfield part of a typical ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons (likely a -CH2- group). The quartet multiplicity (q) means it's adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (-CH3), confirming the ethyl group. The downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Summary of the ethyl group:** The signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an ethyl ester fragment, specifically -COOCH2CH3.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. This signal is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum. The chemical shift is consistent with an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). They integrate to a total of 4 protons, indicating a disubstituted benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a 1,4- (para) disubstituted ring.\n        *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), so they must be adjacent to the strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOCH2CH3).\n        *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield), so they must be adjacent to the electron-donating group (the amine, -NH2).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together**\n    1.  We have a benzene ring.\n    2.  It is 1,4- (para) disubstituted.\n    3.  One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    4.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\n    This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check the proposed options.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data. It's a para-substituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -COOCH2CH3 group.\n    *   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ester linkage is different (-O-CO-CH2CH3). The NMR for the alkyl part would be a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and a quartet at ~2.5 ppm, which does not match the quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not a primary amine, so it would only have one N-H proton and one N-H stretch in the IR. It also contains a formyl proton (-CHO) which would appear as a singlet around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR. This does not match.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
