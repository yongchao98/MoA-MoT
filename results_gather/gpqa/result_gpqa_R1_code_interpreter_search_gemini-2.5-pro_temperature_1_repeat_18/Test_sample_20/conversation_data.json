    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group). This alpha-hydrogen must be on an sp3-hybridized carbon for the typical mechanism to occur.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: It is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons (the alpha-carbons) are part of the ring's double bonds. These carbons are sp2-hybridized.\n        *   Because there are no sp3-hybridized alpha-carbons with hydrogen atoms, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion to its related phenol (hydroquinone) is a reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction, not tautomerism.\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: It is a six-membered saturated ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons. Each of these carbons is an sp3-hybridized carbon atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms.\n        *   These alpha-hydrogens are highly acidic because they are located between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n        *   Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This process is highly favored because the resulting enol is an aromatic compound, which is very stable.\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group).\n        *   This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral.\n        *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: It is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the C=C double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the double bond.\n        *   Any molecule with a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Combination**\n    *   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This matches the conditions described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
