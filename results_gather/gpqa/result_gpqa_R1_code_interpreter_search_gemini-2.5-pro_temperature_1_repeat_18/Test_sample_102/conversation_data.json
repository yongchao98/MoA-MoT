    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. This is also known as **3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone**.\n\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring attached to an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe substituents are all *meta* to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of the Substituents\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence Option\n\nWe need to find a sequence that correctly places these three groups in the 1,3,5-positions.\n\n**Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **i) Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.** This step is fine.\n2.  **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** The -Br group is an o,p-director. This will produce a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene (major product due to less steric hindrance). Neither of these can easily lead to the 1,3,5-pattern.\n3.  **iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on strongly deactivated rings. The ring has both -Br and -NO2 (a strong deactivator), so this reaction would have a very low yield, if it proceeds at all.\n*Conclusion: Option A is not a viable route.*\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.** This is a standard nitration.\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.** This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amino group (-NH2).\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** This step fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is a strong Lewis acid and will react with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3). This deactivates the ring so strongly that the Friedel-Crafts reaction does not occur on the ring. The reagent would N-acylate the aniline, but not C-acylate under these conditions.\n*Conclusion: Option B contains a chemically incorrect step.*\n\n**Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n1.  **i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt** (via diazotization with NaNO2/HCl)\n4.  **iv) Benzenediazonium salt + H3PO2 → Benzene.** This is a deamination reaction, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydrogen atom.\nThis sequence of the first four steps starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless loop.\n*Conclusion: Option D is illogical.*\n\n**Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product has an acetyl group (-COCH3), which is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the meta-position (position 3). This step is correct and efficient.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH3 at C1 (a *meta*-director)\n    *   -Br at C3 (an *ortho, para*-director)\n    The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5. The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Although the directing effects are in conflict, the outcome is determined by the relative activation/deactivation of the positions. The -COCH3 group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (2, 4, 6) highly unreactive. The position meta to it (C5) is the least deactivated position and is therefore the site of substitution. Thus, this step produces the desired target molecule, 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, as the major product.\n\nThis three-step sequence successfully and efficiently synthesizes the target molecule. The question asks which sequence *would lead to* the synthesis. Sequence C accomplishes this by step (iii). The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are extraneous and would modify the target molecule, but their presence does not invalidate the correct synthesis pathway contained within the sequence. Given that the other options contain fatal chemical flaws, Option C is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
