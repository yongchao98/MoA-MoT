    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Synthesis of Product 4\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of acetic acid. While the conditions are not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, the outcome is the same. The reagents facilitate the formation of an enol or enolate equivalent of acetic acid, which then reacts with bromine at the α-carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and sulfuric acid.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 (catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid group reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3), Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is an excellent nucleophile and displaces the bromide leaving group.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3), Sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction sequence for forming a cyclic compound, similar to the malonic ester synthesis.\n        *   **Deprotonation:** The methylene protons (-CH2-) in ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group). The strong base, NaH, deprotonates this carbon to form a stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n            NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n        *   **First Alkylation:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n            [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n        *   **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting molecule still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed to form a new enolate.\n            NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H2\n        *   **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nThe structure consists of a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n      CN\n      |\n      C1--COOCH2CH3\n     / \\\n H2C6   C2H2\n   |     |\n H2C5   C3H2\n   \\   /\n    C4H2\n\n**Symmetry and Chirality Analysis:**\n1.  The carbon atom C1 is attached to four different groups:\n    *   -CN\n    *   -COOCH2CH3\n    *   The ring fragment going from C1 to C2 (-C2H2-C3H2-...)\n    *   The ring fragment going from C1 to C6 (-C6H2-C5H2-...)\n    Since the two substituents (-CN and -COOCH2CH3) are different, the path around the ring in one direction is not equivalent to the path in the other direction from the perspective of an atom on the ring. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is **chiral**.\n2.  A chiral molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n**Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\nBecause the molecule is chiral and has no symmetry, we must consider each proton's unique chemical environment.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 protons total):**\n    *   Since there is no plane of symmetry, the carbons on the left side of the ring (C6, C5) are not equivalent to the carbons on the right side (C2, C3). Therefore, all five methylene (-CH2-) groups of the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are chemically distinct.\n    *   Within each of these five methylene groups, the two geminal protons are **diastereotopic**. This is because they are in a chiral molecule (and also because of the rigid chair-like structure of the ring). Replacing one proton with a deuterium atom would create a diastereomer relative to replacing the other proton. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate NMR signals.\n    *   Therefore, each of the 5 unique -CH2- groups will produce 2 distinct signals.\n    *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-CH2CH3):**\n    *   The ethyl group consists of a methylene group (-CH2-) and a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The methylene (-CH2-) protons are coupled to the methyl protons, and vice-versa.\n    *   In a standard analysis, the two protons of the methylene group are considered equivalent (giving a quartet), and the three protons of the methyl group are equivalent (giving a triplet). This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   (Note: Rigorously, because the ethyl group is part of a chiral molecule, its methylene protons are also diastereotopic. This would lead to 3 signals from the ethyl group. However, this is a more subtle point, and since 10 (ring) + 3 (ethyl) = 13 is not an option, the common simplification of treating the ethyl group as giving 2 signals is intended).\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nTotal signals = Signals from ring + Signals from ethyl group\nTotal signals = 10 + 2 = **12**\n\nThe question includes the statement, \"some of them maybe very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable, but the desired answer is the number of chemically distinct hydrogens\". This supports our detailed analysis, where we count all theoretically non-equivalent protons, such as those on C2 vs. C6, even if their signals might overlap in an actual spectrum.\n\nThus, there are 12 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
