    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This ratio is expressed as M1 / M2.\n\n### 2. Recall the Relevant Physics\nFor a spectroscopic binary star system, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K₁ and K₂). Assuming the orbits are circular and viewed edge-on (inclination i = 90°), the total mass can be derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n\nThe mass function for a binary system is given by:\n(m₁ + m₂) sin³(i) = P * (v₁ + v₂)² * (v₁ + v₂) / (2πG)\n\nWhere:\n-   M = m₁ + m₂ is the total mass of the system.\n-   P is the orbital period.\n-   K₁ and K₂ are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n-   i is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n-   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This implies that the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, which means `sin(i)` is very close to 1. For the purpose of comparing the two systems, we can assume `sin(i) ≈ 1` for both, or at least that the `sin³(i)` term is the same for both and will cancel out in the ratio.\n\nThe formula for the total mass simplifies to:\nM ≈ (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)^3\n\n### 3. Formulate the Ratio\nWe want to find the ratio M1 / M2. Using the formula from the previous step:\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 / (2πG)) * (K1a + K1b)³ ] / [ (P2 / (2πG)) * (K2a + K2b)³ ]\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2πG)` is present in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n### 4. Extract Data from the Problem Statement\nLet's list the given values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n-   Period (P1) = 2 years\n-   Velocity amplitude of star 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n-   Velocity amplitude of star 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n-   Sum of velocities (K1_sum) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n-   Period (P2) = 1 year\n-   Velocity amplitude of star 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n-   Velocity amplitude of star 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n-   Sum of velocities (K2_sum) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio\nNow, substitute the extracted values into the simplified ratio formula. We can use the periods and velocities in their given units (years and km/s) because we are calculating a dimensionless ratio.\n\n-   Ratio of periods: P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n-   Ratio of summed velocities: (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nSubstitute these back into the main ratio equation:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2) * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n### 6. Compare with Options\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Let's compare this to the given choices:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1a = 10  # km/s\nK1b = 5   # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2a = 15  # km/s\nK2b = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_sum = K1a + K1b\nK2_sum = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2)\n# M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_sum / K2_sum)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.432\n```\nThe code confirms the result. System 1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as System 2.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The total mass of an eclipsing spectroscopic binary star system (M) is proportional to the orbital period (P) and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ + K₂). The relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of radial velocity for circular orbits, assuming the inclination angle `i` is 90 degrees (which is a good approximation for eclipsing systems).\n\nThe formula is:\nM = m₁ + m₂ ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂).\n\n**For System 1:**\n-   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n-   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n-   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n-   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, let's set up the ratio M₁ / M₂:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_sum_1)³] / [P₂ * (K_sum_2)³]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
