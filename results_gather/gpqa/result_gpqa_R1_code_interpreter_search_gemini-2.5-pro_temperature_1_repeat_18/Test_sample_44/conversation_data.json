    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Fundamental Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, identical particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the exact same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum States:** For this system, a particle's quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (where `n` = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the `n`-th state of a 1D infinite well is given by:\n    `E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    The problem provides a unit of energy `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    Therefore, the energy of a single particle in level `n` is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\nBecause of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   The lowest energy level is `n=1`. We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The next lowest energy level is `n=2`. We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe configuration is:\n*   2 particles in `n=1`\n*   2 particles in `n=2`\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)`\n`E_ground = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 2^2 * E)`\n`E_ground = (2 * 1 * E) + (2 * 4 * E)`\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E`\n`E_ground = 10E`\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in `n=1`, 2 particles in `n=2`.\n*   Promote one particle from the `n=2` level to the next available level, `n=3`.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   2 particles in `n=1`\n*   1 particle in `n=2`\n*   1 particle in `n=3`\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\n`E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n`E_1st = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E)`\n`E_1st = (2 * 1 * E) + (1 * 4 * E) + (1 * 9 * E)`\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E`\n`E_1st = 15E`\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (Energy increase of 5E)\n\nLet's consider other possible excited configurations and their energies:\n\n*   **Possibility A (First Excited State, already found):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: (2 in n=1), (1 in n=2), (1 in n=3)\n    *   Energy = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. (The `n=2` level is already full).\n    *   Configuration: (1 in n=1), (2 in n=2), (1 in n=3)\n    *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1^2 E) + (2 * 2^2 E) + (1 * 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: (2 in n=1), (2 in n=3)\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1^2 E) + (2 * 3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
