    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that completely inactivates this protein. A mutation that results in a non-functional or truncated protein is the most likely to achieve this goal.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Intact Gene\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCT...`. Let's break this down into codons (three-letter codes for amino acids):\n*   **ATG**: This is the universal start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (M). Protein synthesis begins here.\n*   **TTT**: Codes for Phenylalanine (F).\n*   **CTC**: Codes for Leucine (L).\n*   **GCT**: Codes for Alanine (A).\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe full protein starts with the sequence: `M-F-L-A-...`\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Mutant\n\nWe will now compare each mutant to the intact gene to identify the type of mutation and predict its effect on the final protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...`\n    *   Intact codons: `ATG TTT CTC ...`\n    *   Mutant codons: `ATG TTC TAC ...`\n    *   **Change 1:** The codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (F). This is a **silent mutation** and has no effect on the protein sequence.\n    *   **Change 2:** The codon `CTC` is changed to `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (L), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Y). This is a **missense mutation**, as it swaps one amino acid for another.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein sequence is slightly altered. This might or might not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of that specific Leucine residue. It is not guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...`\n    *   Intact codons: `ATG TTT CTC ...`\n    *   Mutant codons: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n    *   **Change 1:** The codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC` (Phenylalanine -> Phenylalanine). This is a silent mutation.\n    *   **Change 2:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the cellular machinery to stop translation prematurely. The resulting \"protein\" would only be two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine). A protein this severely truncated is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...`\n    *   Intact codons: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   Mutant codons: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...`\n    *   **Change 1:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Change 2:** The codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). This is another **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein has two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of inactivation compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as certain as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTT...`\n    *   Intact sequence: `...GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant sequence: `...GCT --- ACT...`\n    *   **Change 1:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Change 2:** The codon `GGT` (which codes for Glycine) has been deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion** because an entire codon (3 bases) is removed, so the reading frame for subsequent codons remains intact.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein will have one amino acid swapped and will be missing another (Glycine). This will alter the protein's structure, but because the reading frame is preserved, it might retain some or all of its function.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nComparing the potential outcomes:\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 result in altered but full-length (or near full-length) proteins. Their function might be reduced or eliminated, but it is not guaranteed.\n*   Mutant 2 introduces a premature STOP codon very early in the gene (at the 3rd codon). This leads to the production of a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment instead of a full protein. This is the most reliable and direct way to ensure the protein is non-functional.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the one most probably that will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
