    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition. A Michael addition is the nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile (the Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Michael donor precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base used to deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate anion.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is attached to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has no α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is attached to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom. It has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the deprotonation must occur at the C6 position. The bulky t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6, forming an enolate with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate anion acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). The β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   This attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate of the ester. This enolate is then protonated during the reaction work-up (e.g., by adding a mild acid or from the conjugate acid t-BuOH) to give the final neutral product, **A**.\n\n6.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate skeleton with the cyclohexanone ring as a substituent.\n    *   The main chain is named as **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent according to IUPAC rules, the point of attachment is designated as C1.\n        *   Old C6 (attachment point) becomes new **C1**. It has a methyl group.\n        *   Old C1 (carbonyl carbon) becomes new **C2**. It has the oxo group.\n        *   Old C2 becomes new **C3**. It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent is named **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name for product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name given in options A and B.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   **Michael donor precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the nitro group are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   **Proton source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nitronate Anion (Michael Donor):**\n    *   The base, KOH, removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion, known as a nitronate anion.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CH=NO₂]⁻ H⁺ + H₂O. The nucleophilic attack will occur from the carbon atom.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane unit and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile unit.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Protonation:**\n    *   The resulting carbanion intermediate (stabilized by the adjacent nitrile group) is protonated by water (H₂O) to yield the final product, **B**.\n\n6.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   To name the product, we first identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain containing this group becomes the parent chain.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   **C1:** Nitrile carbon\n        *   **C2:** CH₂\n        *   **C3:** CH with a methyl substituent.\n        *   **C4:** CH with a nitro substituent.\n        *   **C5:** CH₂\n        *   **C6:** CH₃\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given in options A and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nOption A is the only one that correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
