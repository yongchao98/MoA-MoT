    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   The \"pyran\" core indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   \"Tetrahydro\" means the ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   \"-2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring.\n*   \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) at position 4.\n*   The chiral center is at C4, which is bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different paths within the ring.\n\nA lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (an esterification reaction) of a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alcohol (-OH) group. For a six-membered delta-lactone like this one, the precursor is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n\nThe structure of the precursor hydroxy acid must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n      OH         O\n      |         //\n  HO-CH2-CH2-CH-CH2-C-OH\n              |\n              CH2-CH3\n```\nLet's number this chain starting from the carboxylic acid carbon (C1). The ethyl group is at C3, and the hydroxyl group is at C5. The chiral center is C3. When this molecule cyclizes under acidic conditions (H+), it forms the lactone. The C3 of the acid becomes the C4 of the lactone, and the stereochemistry is preserved.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provide enantiomers of a compound named **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Although the IUPAC name is slightly ambiguous, it describes a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid (3-ethylpentanedioic acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has been converted into an isobutyl ester.\n\nTo obtain the desired 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor, the starting material must have its functional groups at C1 and C5. The structure must be:\n```\n       O                    O\n      //                   //\nHO - C - CH2 - CH - CH2 - C - O-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n             |\n             CH2-CH3\n(Carboxylic Acid at C1)   (Isobutyl Ester at C5)\n```\nThis molecule has the required carbon skeleton and has a chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nWe need to consider the specific action of each reducing agent on the starting material, which has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)** is a reducing agent that is selective for reducing aldehydes, ketones, and **esters**. It does not typically reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n    *   Therefore, LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 untouched.\n    *   This reaction directly forms the required precursor: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   The reduction occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center (C3). Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   Since the final product is the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n    *   **BH3 (Borane)** is a reducing agent that is highly effective and selective for reducing **carboxylic acids**. It is less reactive towards esters.\n    *   Therefore, BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), while leaving the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at C5 untouched (at least initially).\n    *   The immediate product of reduction is a hydroxy-ester: `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`.\n    *   The reaction is worked up with acid (H+), which will hydrolyze the remaining ester group to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The final result of the reduction and workup is the same precursor: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   The reduction occurs at C1, which is not the chiral center (C3). Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   Since the final product is the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
