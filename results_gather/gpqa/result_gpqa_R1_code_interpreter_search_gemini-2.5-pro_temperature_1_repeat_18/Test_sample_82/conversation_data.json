    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) before dilution.\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol CH₃COOH.\n\n*   Next, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same (0.001 mol).\n    *   New Concentration (Ca) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Titration with NaOH**\n\nThe titration reaction is:\nCH₃COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) → CH₃COONa (aq) + H₂O (l)\n\nThis is a reaction between a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**3. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Equivalence Point Volume:** First, let's find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point, where moles of NaOH equal the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Volume of NaOH (V_eq) = Moles of acid / Concentration of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **25% Titration Point:** At 25% titration, we have added 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH.\n    *   Moles of NaOH added = 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.\n    *   This amount of NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH to produce 0.00025 mol of its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = Initial moles - Moles reacted = 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol.\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** At this point, the solution contains both a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), forming a buffer. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   where A⁻ is the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) and HA is the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n    *   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of their moles.\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\n*   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**4. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH has reacted with 0.001 mol of NaOH (in 10.00 cm³ of NaOH solution). The only species affecting the pH is the 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), formed during the reaction.\n\n*   **Concentration of Acetate:** We need to find the concentration of the acetate ion in the solution.\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), which makes the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ (aq) + H₂O (l) ⇌ CH₃COOH (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n\n*   **Calculating [OH⁻]:** We can set up an ICE table, but a simplified formula is usually sufficient: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻])\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 )\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   **Calculating pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) = 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n\n*   So, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n\n# pKa calculation\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\nratio_A_HA = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_A_HA)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the equivalence point ---\n\n# Moles of acetic acid\nmoles_acid = 0.020 * 0.05 # Initial volume (L) * Initial concentration (M)\n\n# Concentration of acetate at equivalence point\n# Total volume = 40 mL (diluted acid) + 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL = 0.050 L\n# Moles of acetate = initial moles of acid\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / 0.050\n\n# Kb calculation\nKb = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# [OH-] calculation from hydrolysis of acetate\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# pOH and pH calculation\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial state and the dilution.**\n\n1.  We start with 20.00 cm³ (or 0.0200 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n2.  First, calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n3.  This solution is then diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n4.  Calculate the new total volume and the new concentration of the acetic acid.\n    *   New Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   New Concentration (Ca) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n    This 0.025 M solution is what we will be titrating.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the titration reaction.**\n\n*   The titration involves a weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH).\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n*   This is a 1:1 molar reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n1.  \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the initial moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by the NaOH.\n2.  At this point, the solution contains both the unreacted weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻), which is formed by the reaction. This is a buffer solution.\n3.  We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n4.  First, calculate pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n5.  At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n6.  Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n1.  At the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the product, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), in water.\n2.  The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n    *   Hydrolysis reaction: CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n3.  To calculate the pH, we first need to find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n    *   First, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n        *   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added.\n        *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   The concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] is the moles of acetate (which equals the initial moles of acid) divided by the total volume.\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n4.  Now, we calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] produced by the hydrolysis.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   For the hydrolysis of a weak base, we can approximate [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] ≈ √( (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ) ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n5.  Calculate the pOH and then the pH.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the results with the given options.**\n\n*   Calculated pH at 25% titration: 4.26\n*   Calculated pH at the equivalence point: 8.52\n*   This matches option C.\n\nThe Python code below confirms these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020 # L\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05 # M\nvol_water = 0.020 # L\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Part 0: Dilution ---\ninitial_moles_acid = initial_vol_acid * initial_conc_acid\ndiluted_vol_acid = initial_vol_acid + vol_water\ndiluted_conc_acid = initial_moles_acid / diluted_vol_acid\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% titration ---\n# At 25% titration, a buffer is formed.
