    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the atoms and bonds correctly. The chemical name is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nLet's break down the structure and count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: This is a carbon atom double-bonded to another carbon, and also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups. It contributes 1 (central) + 2 (methyl) = 3 carbon atoms and 2 * 3 = 6 hydrogen atoms.\n*   `=CH-`: This carbon is part of the double bond and is bonded to one hydrogen. It contributes 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   `-CH2-`: A methylene group. It contributes 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: A carbon in the chain bonded to one hydrogen and one methyl group. It contributes 1 (chain) + 1 (methyl) = 2 carbons and 1 (chain) + 3 (methyl) = 4 hydrogens.\n*   `-CH2-`: Another methylene group. It contributes 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   `-CH=`: This carbon is part of a double bond and is bonded to one hydrogen. It contributes 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: This carbon completes the double bond and is bonded to two methyl groups. It contributes 1 (central) + 2 (methyl) = 3 carbons and 2 * 3 = 6 hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number and Types of Bonds**\n\nNow, we count each type of covalent bond in the molecule:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The formula C12H22 tells us there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: `(CH3)2C=CH` and `CH=C(CH3)2`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** These are all the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   Bonds within the main chain: C-C-C-C-C-C. There are 4 single bonds in the chain: `C=C-C-C-C-C=C`.\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the chain:\n        *   Two on the first carbon: `(CH3)2C=`\n        *   One on the fourth carbon: `-CH(CH3)-`\n        *   Two on the last carbon: `=C(CH3)2`\n        *   Total bonds to methyl groups = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 4 (chain) + 5 (methyls) = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule (ΔH_atom)**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound to form gaseous atoms. It's the sum of all the bond energies.\nΔH_atom = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔH_atom = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy to Form Gaseous Atoms from Standard States**\n\nThe formation of the molecule C12H22 involves starting from the standard states of its elements: 12 moles of solid carbon (C(s)) and 11 moles of hydrogen gas (H2(g)). We need to find the enthalpy change to convert these into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) and 22 H(g).\n\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    *   ΔH = 12 × Enthalpy of atomization of carbon\n    *   ΔH = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   ΔH = 11 × Bond energy of H-H\n    *   ΔH = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy for atomizing the reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) can be calculated using Hess's Law. The overall process can be seen as:\n1.  Atomizing the elements in their standard state (energy input).\n2.  Forming the molecule from the gaseous atoms (energy released, which is the negative of the enthalpy of atomization).\n\nΔHf° = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the product molecule)\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf° = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert the Result to the Units in the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 11.44 kJ/g\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the ΔH_atom we calculated, not ΔHf°)\nD) 1900 kJ/g (The value is correct, but the unit is likely a typo)\n\nSince Option A is given in kJ/g, we should convert our result to these units and check if it matches.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 × 12.011 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.3 g/mol. (Using integer masses 12 and 1 gives 166 g/mol).\n\nNow, convert kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = ΔHf° (in kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (in g/mol)\nΔHf° (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value is extremely close to Option A.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define given values\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_equal_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 2: Define molecule properties\n# Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n# Molecular Formula: C12H22\nnum_C_atoms = 12\nnum_H_atoms = 22\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H_atoms / 2\n\n# Number of bonds\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_equal_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\n\n# Step 3: Calculate enthalpy of atomization of the molecule\nenthalpy_atomization_molecule = (num_C_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                                (num_C_equal_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_equal_C) + \\\n                                (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate total enthalpy to form gaseous atoms from standard states\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C_atoms * enthalpy_atomization_C) + \\\n                                 (num_H2_molecules * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - enthalpy_atomization_molecule\n\n# Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22 = 12 * 12 + 22 * 1 = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\nmolar_mass = 12 * 12.011 + 22 * 1.008\nenthalpy_formation_gram = enthalpy_formation_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of the molecule: {enthalpy_atomization_molecule} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of reactants: {enthalpy_atomization_reactants} kJ\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {enthalpy_formation_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass: {molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {enthalpy_formation_gram} kJ/g\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Atoms**\nThe chemical name is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n*   Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH) + 1 (from CH3) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 atoms.\n*   Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 atoms.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number and Types of Bonds**\nBased on the structure C12H22:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure `(CH3)2C=CH-...-CH=C(CH3)2` shows two carbon-carbon double bonds. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** We can find the number of C-C single bonds by subtracting the other bonds from the total number of bonds in an acyclic molecule (Total atoms - 1).\n    *   Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\n    *   Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33.\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (No. of C-H bonds) - (No. of C=C bonds)\n    *   Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 22 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of the Molecule (Product)**\nThis is the energy needed to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule.\nΔH_atomization_product = (9 × BE_C-C) + (2 × BE_C=C) + (22 × BE_C-H)\nΔH_atomization_product = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization_product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\nThe formation reaction is `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)`.\nWe need the energy to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of gaseous carbon and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen).\n*   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total ΔH_atomization_reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when forming the product from its atoms (which is the enthalpy of atomization of the product).\nΔHf° = ΔH_atomization_reactants - ΔH_atomization_product\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert to kJ/g**\nThe question provides an answer in kJ/g. We need to convert our result.\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.011 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 166.3 g/mol.\n*   ΔHf° (in kJ/g) = ΔHf° (in kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (in g/mol)\n*   ΔHf° (in kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166.3 g/mol ≈ **11.42 kJ/g**\n\nThis value is very close to option A.
