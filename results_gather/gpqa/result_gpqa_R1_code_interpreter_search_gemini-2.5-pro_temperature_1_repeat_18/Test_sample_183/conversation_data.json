    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    The target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    Let's identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n    *   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n    This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene derivative, meaning all three substituents are adjacent to each other. This substitution pattern can be tricky to achieve and often requires careful planning of the reaction sequence.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    To plan a synthesis, we need to know how each group directs incoming electrophiles in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing. It's bulky, so para substitution is often favored over ortho.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-NH2 (amino):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. Often used as an intermediate by reducing a nitro group.\n    *   **-OH (hydroxyl):** Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. A precursor to the ethoxy group.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies (Working Backwards/Forwards):**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Add nitro group last.** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. Both -OEt and -tBu are ortho-, para-directors. They would direct nitration to positions 4 and 6, not the desired position 3. This strategy fails.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Add tert-butyl group last.** The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The -OEt group is a strong o,p-director, while the -NO2 group is a strong m-director. Both direct to positions 2, 4, and 6. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions like tert-butylation work poorly on strongly deactivated rings (due to the -NO2 group). Even if it worked, the bulky t-Bu group would likely go to the less hindered positions 4 or 6, not the crowded position 2. This strategy fails.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Add ethoxy group last.** This is the most common strategy for introducing alkoxy groups. It's usually done via Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) on a corresponding phenol (-OH). The phenol itself is often made from an amine (-NH2) via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. This suggests the key intermediate could be an aniline derivative. This seems like a promising route.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Provided Options Step-by-Step:**\n    All options start with the tert-butylation of benzene. This is a logical first step.\n    *   **Step i:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n    Let's analyze each option from this starting point.\n\n    *   **Option A:**\n        *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n        *   ii) Nitration → 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (major) and 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor).\n        *   iii) Sulfonation of this product.\n        *   iv) **NaNO2/HCl**: This is a diazotization reagent, which requires a primary amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a nitro-sulfonic acid, it has no amino group. This step is chemically impossible. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B:**\n        *   i) tert-butylbenzene\n        *   ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (para due to sterics).\n        *   iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl).\n        *   vi) **HNO3/H2SO4**: This is a nitrating agent. Applying it to a highly reactive diazonium salt is nonsensical and dangerous. It would not lead to a controlled product. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C:**\n        *   i) Nitration of benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Reduction → Aniline.\n        *   iii) **tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation fails on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D:**\n        This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze it carefully.\n        *   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.** (OK)\n        *   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** To get the 1,2,3-pattern, we need the *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. While the para isomer is major, the ortho isomer is formed and could be separated. Let's proceed with this intermediate.\n        *   **iii) Fe/HCl → Reduction.** 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to **2-tert-butylaniline**. (OK)\n        *   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration.** We are nitrating 2-tert-butylaniline. The directors are -tBu (at C1, o,p-directing) and -NH2 (at C2, strong o,p-directing). The powerful -NH2 group directs to positions 3 and 5. To get the target, we need nitration at position 3, which is sterically hindered between the -tBu and -NH2 groups. While likely a minor product, it is a possible one. Let's assume we get the desired **1-tert-butyl-2-amino-3-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   **v) NaNO2/HCl → Diazotization.** The amino group at C2 is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). (OK)\n        *   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → Hydrolysis.** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol. The -N2+ at C2 is replaced by -OH, yielding **1-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (OK)\n        *   **vii) NaOH/EtBr → Williamson Ether Synthesis.** The phenol is converted to an ether. The -OH at C2 is converted to -OEt, yielding **1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   Let's check if this is the target molecule. The target is **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Let's compare the structures.\n            *   Product of step vii: A benzene ring with tBu, OEt, and NO2 groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n            *   Target Molecule: A benzene ring with OEt, tBu, and NO2 groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n            *   These two molecules have the same connectivity (substituents are ortho, meta, ortho to each other in the same way). They are the same molecule, just named starting from a different substituent. Therefore, this reaction sequence produces the target molecule.\n        *   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 and ix) dilute H2SO4:** These are sulfonation and desulfonation steps. They are added at the end, after the target molecule has already been synthesized. This is nonsensical and likely an error in the question's construction. However, the core synthesis (steps i-vii) is chemically plausible.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Options A, B, and C contain chemically flawed or impossible steps. Option D outlines a sequence that, while having steps with potential low yields for the desired regioisomer, is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule. The final two steps in D are extraneous, but this doesn't invalidate the preceding correct synthesis. Therefore, D is the best and only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
