    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nThe system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0). When the charge `q` is brought near the sphere, charges on the conductor redistribute themselves to keep the potential on the surface at zero. This redistribution results in an attractive force between the charge `q` and the sphere, and thus the system has a certain net potential energy.\n\n### 2. Method of Images\n\nThis problem is a classic example that can be solved using the \"method of images\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed inside the sphere. The position (`b`) and magnitude (`q'`) of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface (where the conductor was) is zero.\n\n### 3. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `x=d`. We place an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the origin along the same line.\n\nThe potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center) must be zero. The potential at such a point due to the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is:\n`V(surface) = k*q/r₁ + k*q'/r₂ = 0`\nwhere `r₁` is the distance from the point on the surface to `q`, and `r₂` is the distance from the point on the surface to `q'`.\n\nBy solving this condition for all points on the sphere, we find the standard results for the image charge:\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R² / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex system of the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `d` and `q' = -qR/d` at `b = R²/d`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n#### Method 1: Work Done\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n*   Consider the charge `q` at a variable distance `x` from the center of the sphere (`x > R`).\n*   At this position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a position `b(x) = R²/x`.\n*   The force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q` is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - b(x))²`\n    `F(x) = -k * q² * R / (x * (x - R²/x)²) = -k * q² * R / (x * ((x²-R²)/x)²) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n*   This is the attractive force exerted by the sphere on the charge. The external force required to move the charge is `F_ext = -F(x)`.\n*   The work done (which is the potential energy `U`) is the integral of this external force from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = ∫[from ∞ to d] F_ext dx = ∫[from ∞ to d] -F(x) dx`\n    `U = ∫[from ∞ to d] (k * q² * R * x) / (x² - R²)² dx`\n*   To solve the integral, we use a substitution: let `u = x² - R²`, then `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`.\n    `U = k * q² * R * ∫ 1/u² * (du/2)`\n    `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * ∫ u⁻² du = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1/u]`\n*   Substituting back `u = x² - R²`:\n    `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1 / (x² - R²)]`\n*   Now, we evaluate the definite integral from `x = ∞` to `x = d`:\n    `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d² - R²)) - (-1 / (∞² - R²))]`\n    `U = (k * q² * R / 2) * [-1 / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n#### Method 2: Energy of Interaction (with a correction factor)\n\nA quicker method is to calculate the potential energy of interaction between the real charge `q` and the final image charge `q'`. However, a factor of 1/2 is necessary. The potential energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. This `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   Potential at `d` due to `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b=R²/d`) is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d) = -k * q * R / (d² - R²) `\n*   The potential energy of the system is:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`. This matches option A.\n\n*   **A) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)** - This matches our result.\n*   B) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect form.\n*   C) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect power of R.\n*   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Missing the factor of 1/2 and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
