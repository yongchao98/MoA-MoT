    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    Mass fraction of H = (mass of H) / (total molecular mass)\n    0.1428 is very close to 1/7.\n    Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    If the hydrocarbon is a saturated cycloalkane, its general formula is CnH2n.\n    The mass fraction of H would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`.\n    This matches the given value perfectly (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    If the hydrocarbon were a saturated alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H would be `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7(2n+2) = 14n+2`, which simplifies to `14n + 14 = 14n + 2`, or `14 = 2`, which is impossible.\n    Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one* substance, Z. This is a critical clue. It means that all the chemical compounds present in mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the formula CnH2n with n=6.\n    So, we can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Consequently, all compounds in mixtures X and Y are C6 compounds with a six-membered ring structure.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    Y does *not* decolorize bromine water, which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    We know that Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components of Y. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    Disproportionation reactions of unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons, especially catalyzed by platinum, typically involve hydrogen transfer, producing a fully saturated molecule and a fully dehydrogenated (aromatic) molecule.\n    The fully dehydrogenated C6 ring is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n    Let's check this: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would yield:\n    *   Cyclohexane (C6H12) + H2 → No reaction (it's already saturated).\n    *   Benzene (C6H6) + 3H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    The only product is cyclohexane (Z), which matches the problem statement.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    The reaction is a disproportionation that forms the equimolar mixture Y. Since both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1.\n    A + B → Cyclohexane + Benzene\n    C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6\n    To balance the hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogens in the reactants must equal the total in the products:\n    x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18.\n\n    Now we need to identify A and B based on the properties of mixture X:\n    *   They are C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). They are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\n    Let's list the possible candidates:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has one double bond. It is not conjugated. This is a valid candidate. (x=10)\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)**: Have two double bonds.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: The double bonds are conjugated. This is excluded by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene**: The double bonds are separated by two single bonds (non-conjugated). This is a valid candidate. (y=8)\n\n    Since X is a mixture of \"two liquids,\" A and B must be different. The only valid candidates are cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n    Let's check the hydrogen sum: x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement perfectly.\n    The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing 2H, and the less unsaturated cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining those 2H.\n    C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n    This entire scheme is chemically consistent and fits all the clues provided in the problem.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (Cyclohexene, C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
