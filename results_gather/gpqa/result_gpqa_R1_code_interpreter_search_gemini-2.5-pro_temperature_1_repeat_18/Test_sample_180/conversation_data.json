    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Event:** The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core stops.\n    *   **Timing:** This happened ~8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Sun-Earth travel time for light/neutrinos is about 8.5 minutes, we are observing the effects on Earth *right now*.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** All other reaction branches (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) remain unchanged.\n    *   **Question:** What is the approximate flux ratio between two energy bands: Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV)?\n\n2.  **Identify the Neutrino Sources and their Energies:**\n    To understand the impact, we need to know which reactions produce neutrinos and at what energies. We can consult the Standard Solar Model for this.\n\n    *   **pp-I chain:** Produces `pp` neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** Produces Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`) neutrinos. These are mono-energetic, with a major line at **861 keV** (and a much weaker one at 384 keV).\n    *   **pp-III chain:** Produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`) neutrinos. These have a continuous and high-energy spectrum, extending up to ~15 MeV.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** Produces several types of neutrinos (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`, `¹⁷F`) with continuous spectra, mostly in the 1-2 MeV range.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Effect of Stopping the pp-III Branch:**\n    *   The pp-III branch is the source of `⁸B` neutrinos.\n    *   If this branch stops, the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases.\n    *   Therefore, the `⁸B` neutrino flux at Earth drops to zero.\n    *   Crucially, the problem states that the pp-II branch is *unaffected*. This means the production of `⁷Be` neutrinos continues as normal.\n\n4.  **Examine the Flux in Each Energy Band *After* the Change:**\n    We now need to see which remaining neutrino sources contribute to our two energy bands.\n\n    *   **Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7 - 0.8 MeV)**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos? No, their energy is too low (< 420 keV).\n        *   `⁷Be` neutrinos? No, the line is at 861 keV, which is outside this band.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos? No, they have been turned off by the scenario.\n        *   **CNO neutrinos? Yes.** The continuous spectra of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos from the CNO cycle extend into this energy range. The flux from the CNO cycle is significant, but much lower than the main pp-chain fluxes.\n\n    *   **Band 2: 800-900 keV (0.8 - 0.9 MeV)**\n        *   `pp` neutrinos? No.\n        *   **`⁷Be` neutrinos? Yes.** The very strong mono-energetic line at **861 keV** falls squarely within this band.\n        *   `⁸B` neutrinos? No, they are gone.\n        *   **CNO neutrinos? Yes.** Their continuous spectra also contribute a small amount of flux in this band.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    The ratio we need is Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n\n    *   **Flux(Band 1)** is now composed solely of the CNO cycle neutrinos that fall within the 700-800 keV window. This is a relatively small flux.\n    *   **Flux(Band 2)** is composed of the *very large* flux from the `⁷Be` line plus a small contribution from CNO neutrinos. The `⁷Be` line flux is completely dominant in this band.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio is approximately:\n    Ratio ≈ (small CNO flux in a 100 keV window) / (large `⁷Be` line flux)\n\n6.  **Estimate with Numerical Values:**\n    Let's use standard values for solar neutrino fluxes to get a quantitative estimate.\n    *   Total flux of the `⁷Be` line at 861 keV: F(⁷Be) ≈ 5.0 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n    *   Total flux of CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` + `¹⁵O`): F(CNO) ≈ (2.96 + 2.23) x 10⁸ ≈ 5.2 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n\n    The CNO flux is spread over a wide energy range (roughly 1.5 MeV). We need the portion in the 100 keV (0.1 MeV) window of Band 1. A simple order-of-magnitude estimate is to assume the flux is spread somewhat evenly, so the flux in our window is a fraction of the total:\n    Flux(Band 1) ≈ F(CNO) * (0.1 MeV / 1.5 MeV) ≈ 5.2 x 10⁸ * (1/15) ≈ 3.5 x 10⁷ / (cm²·s)\n\n    Now we can compute the ratio:\n    Ratio ≈ Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (3.5 x 10⁷) / (5.0 x 10⁹)\n    Ratio ≈ 3.5 / 500 = 0.007\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated ratio is ~0.007. Let's look at the given choices:\n    A) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n    B) 1\n    C) 10\n    D) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n\n    Our calculated value of 0.007 is extremely close to 0.01. The key physical insight is that after the change, Band 2 contains a massive flux from a spectral line, while Band 1 is left with only a small residual flux from a continuous spectrum. The ratio must be a small number, and 0.01 is the only plausible option.\n\n<<<D>>>"
