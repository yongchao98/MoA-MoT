    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle**: The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The physical law that governs the distribution of particles among energy states in thermal equilibrium is the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write the Boltzmann Equation**: The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (let's say an excited state, `N_exc`, and the ground state, `N_g`) to the temperature `T` of the system.\n    \n    `N_exc / N_g = (g_exc / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    \n    Where:\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n    *   `g_exc` and `g_g` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the respective energy levels.\n    \n    The term `N_exc / N_g` represents the level of excitation for that specific energy transition.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars**: We need to write this equation for each of the two stars, star_1 (with temperature `T_1`) and star_2 (with temperature `T_2`).\n    \n    For star_1:\n    `(N_exc / N_g)_1 = (g_exc / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n    \n    For star_2:\n    `(N_exc / N_g)_2 = (g_exc / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n    \n    Note that `ΔE`, `k`, `g_exc`, and `g_g` are the same for both stars because we are observing the same iron atom transition.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Condition from the Problem**: The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the excitation ratio for star_1 is two times the excitation ratio for star_2.\n    \n    `(N_exc / N_g)_1 = 2 * (N_exc / N_g)_2`\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations and Simplify**: Now, substitute the expressions from step 3 into the condition from step 4.\n    \n    `(g_exc / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_exc / g_g) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    \n    The degeneracy term `(g_exc / g_g)` appears on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    \n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Relationship between Temperatures**: To solve for the temperatures, we need to eliminate the exponentials by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n    \n    `ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    \n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    \n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n    \n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n    \n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n    \n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    \n    `(ΔE / k) * [1/T_2 - 1/T_1] = ln(2)`\n    \n    Combine the fractions in the bracket by finding a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n    \n    `(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n\n7.  **Use the Given Numerical Values**: The problem provides the following values:\n    *   Energy difference, `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   The Boltzmann constant, `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n    \n    Let's calculate the value of the term `(ΔE / k)`:\n    \n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    \n    Substituting this result back into our derived equation:\n    \n    `(1 K) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n    \n    This simplifies to:\n    \n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options**: The final derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
