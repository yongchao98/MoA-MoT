    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**\n    To solve the Schrödinger equation more easily, we should convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The conversion formulas are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r² = x² + y²\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))²\n    Since x = r cos(θ), we have:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\n    Now, combine the terms:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 kx² + 3/2 kx²) + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\n3.  **Identify the System:**\n    The potential V(x, y) is a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx² and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky².\n    This is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n4.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:**\n    The time-independent Schrödinger equation in 2D is:\n    [-ħ²/2m (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²) + V(x, y)] ψ(x, y) = E ψ(x, y)\n\n    Since the potential is separable, the equation can be separated into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations, one for the x-motion and one for the y-motion. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n5.  **Find the Energy for the x-motion:**\n    The Schrödinger equation for the x-dimension is:\n    [-ħ²/2m d²/dx² + V_x(x)] ψ_x(x) = E_x ψ_x(x)\n    [-ħ²/2m d²/dx² + 2kx²] ψ_x(x) = E_x ψ_x(x)\n\n    This is the equation for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The standard potential for a 1D QHO is (1/2)mω²x². We compare our potential V_x(x) to this standard form to find the angular frequency ω_x:\n    1/2 mω_x²x² = 2kx²\n    mω_x² = 4k\n    ω_x² = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D QHO are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. For the x-motion, with quantum number n_x:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n    E_{n_x} = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Find the Energy for the y-motion:**\n    Similarly, for the y-dimension:\n    [-ħ²/2m d²/dy² + V_y(y)] ψ_y(y) = E_y ψ_y(y)\n    [-ħ²/2m d²/dy² + 1/2 ky²] ψ_y(y) = E_y ψ_y(y)\n\n    Compare V_y(y) = 1/2 ky² to the standard form (1/2)mω_y²y²:\n    1/2 mω_y²y² = 1/2 ky²\n    mω_y² = k\n    ω_y² = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-motion, with quantum number n_y, are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Energy:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of E_{n_x} and E_{n_y}:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Combine the terms:\n    E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m), where n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n    Let's compare this with the given choices:\n    A) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    C) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    D) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    Our result matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
