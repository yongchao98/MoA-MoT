    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method and Doppler Shift:**\n    The RV method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" back and forth due to the planet's gravitational pull, its light is blue-shifted when it moves towards us and red-shifted when it moves away.\n    The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) by the Doppler formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the wavelength shift, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is the amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as $K$.\n    Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Relate the RV amplitudes of the two stars:**\n    We are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    -   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n    Since $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n    And conversely:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Derive the relationship between RV amplitude (K) and orbital period (P):**\n    The formula for the RV amplitude $K$ for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    -   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    -   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    -   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    -   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    -   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Apply the formula to the specific problem:**\n    We are given the following information:\n    -   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    -   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    In RV measurements, the quantity determined is actually the minimum mass, $m_p \\sin i$. The problem states the planets have similar masses, which in the context of RV detection implies that the measured quantities, $m_{p1} \\sin i_1$ and $m_{p2} \\sin i_2$, are approximately equal.\n    -   $G$ is a constant.\n\n    Based on this, all the terms in the equation for $K$ are constant for both systems, except for $K$ and $P$. We can therefore establish a proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:**\n    From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write the relationship between the two systems as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Substitute the known values:**\n    We already found that $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n7.  **Compute the final numerical answer:**\n    To find the decimal value, we perform the division.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\nresult = (5/7)**3\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_result>\nThe result is approximately 0.364.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's light caused by its \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it. The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity.
