    "*   **Analysis of Compound X**\n\n    1.  **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is likely an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal (7.2 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent (which must be an electron-donating alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the second substituent on the ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This is a `CH₃CH₂-` fragment.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH). This is a `CH₃CH(-)-` fragment.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂) from the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the methyl group (0.9 ppm) and the methine group (2.9 ppm).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH). This proton is attached to the benzene ring (making it benzylic) and is also coupled to the adjacent `-CH₂-` and `-CH₃` groups, hence the complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting these pieces together `(CH₃CH₂-)` and `(CH₃CH-)`, connected by the methine carbon, gives us a **sec-butyl group**: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Compound X:**\n        Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n    1.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    2.  **Reaction Type:** Red P / HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, the carboxyl group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    3.  **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected by these reagents.\n        *   Final Product: The resulting molecule will have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in a para- (1,4-) relationship on the benzene ring. The name of this product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    The starting material, Compound X, is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its reaction with Red P / HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, yielding 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
