    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Aperture:** An N-sided polygon.\n    *   **Key Geometric Property:** All apothems are of the same length, 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   **Limiting Case:** The number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n    *   **Physics:** Monochromatic light (wavelength λ) is incident normally on this aperture. We are interested in the far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern.\n    *   **Question:** What is the angular distance between the first two intensity minima?\n    *   **Approximation:** Small angles are involved, so we can use `sin(θ) ≈ tan(θ) ≈ θ`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Aperture Shape in the Limit:**\n    *   As the number of sides (N) of a regular polygon increases to infinity, the polygon approaches a smooth curve.\n    *   The problem states the apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to a side) is constant.\n    *   In the limit as N -> ∞, the sides become infinitesimally small and form a continuous boundary. The distance from the center to any point on this boundary is the same and is equal to the apothem 'a'.\n    *   Therefore, an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' and N -> ∞ becomes a **circle of radius 'a'**.\n\n3.  **Frame the Physics Problem:**\n    *   The problem is now simplified to finding the diffraction pattern from a **circular aperture of radius 'a'**.\n    *   This is a classic problem in optics, leading to the \"Airy pattern\". The Airy pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n4.  **Recall or Find the Formula for Minima in an Airy Pattern:**\n    *   The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n        where `J₁` is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `k` is the wave number (`2π/λ`), `a` is the radius of the aperture, and `θ` is the angle from the central axis.\n    *   The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`.\n    *   Let `x = k * a * sinθ`. The minima correspond to the non-zero roots (zeros) of the `J₁(x)` function. Let's denote these roots as `z₁, z₂, z₃, ...`.\n    *   So, the condition for the *m*-th minimum is `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angular Position of the Minima:**\n    *   Substitute `k = 2π / λ`:\n        `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `sin(θ_m)`:\n        `sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n    *   Apply the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`):\n        `θ_m ≈ (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n6.  **Find the Necessary Zeros of the Bessel Function:**\n    *   We need the angular distance between the *first two* minima, so we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`.\n    *   From standard mathematical tables or a search, these values are:\n        *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`):\n        `θ₁ ≈ (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n        *(This corresponds to option A, a common distractor representing the position of the first minimum, not the separation).*\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`):\n        `θ₂ ≈ (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The required angular distance is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `Δθ = [ (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ] - [ (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ]`\n    *   `Δθ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n    *   Now, substitute the values of `z₁` and `z₂` into the coefficient part of the expression.\n\n9.  **Perform the final calculation using a Python script for precision:**\n    *   The coefficient is `C = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # The first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x).\n    z1 = 3.8317\n    z2 = 7.0156\n\n    # The formula for the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n    # delta_theta = ( (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi) ) * (lambda / a)\n    # We need to calculate the coefficient C = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi).\n\n    coefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\n    print(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n    ```\n    \n    <execute_code>\n    \n    Print output:\n    0.507\n    \n    </execute_code>\n    \n10. **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated coefficient is approximately 0.507.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) 0.610\n        B) 1.220\n        C) 0.500\n        D) 0.506\n    *   The calculated value `0.507` is extremely close to `0.506`. The minor difference is due to the rounding of the input `z₁` and `z₂` values. Using more precise values for the zeros (`z₁=3.831706`, `z₂=7.015587`) gives a result of `0.50676`, which rounds to `0.507`. Option D is the intended and closest answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
