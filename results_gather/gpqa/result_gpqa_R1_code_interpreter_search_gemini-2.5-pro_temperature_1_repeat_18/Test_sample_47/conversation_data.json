    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reaction type:** Alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a cyclic ketone) and bromine.\n*   **Mechanism:** In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, cyclohexanone forms an enol or enolate. This nucleophilic intermediate then attacks a bromine molecule (Br₂).\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction places a bromine atom on one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reaction type:** Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (an α-halo ketone) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base).\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction is a classic example of the Favorskii rearrangement.\n    1.  The strong base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), which is acidic due to the adjacent carbonyl group. This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack, displacing the bromide ion from C2. This forms a strained, bicyclic intermediate called a cyclopropanone derivative (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The nucleophilic hydroxide ion (OH⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate, opening the three-membered ring.\n    4.  The ring opens to form the most stable carbanion. In this case, it leads to the formation of a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Protonation during workup gives the final product of this step.\n*   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   *Alternative Consideration:* An E2 elimination could also occur to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the Favorskii rearrangement is a very common pathway for α-halo ketones with an available α'-proton, and the subsequent reaction steps are more consistent with the Favorskii product.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reaction type:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride.\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a standard and efficient method to synthesize acyl chlorides from carboxylic acids. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction type:** Selective reduction of an acyl chloride.\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and LiAlH(OtBu)₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. It delivers one hydride ion (H⁻) to the carbonyl carbon, replacing the chlorine.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens are in non-equivalent chemical environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O) and the C1 carbon to which it is attached, bisecting the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogen environments:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique electronic environment. This is one set. (1H)\n    2.  **C1 Proton:** The single proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. This is a second set. (1H)\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the C2 position is equivalent to the C5 position. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation of the molecule). The same is true for the two protons on C5. The symmetry plane makes one proton on C2 equivalent to one on C5, and the other proton on C2 equivalent to the other on C5. This gives two more distinct sets of protons.\n        *   Set 3: Two equivalent protons (one on C2, one on C5). (2H)\n        *   Set 4: Two equivalent protons (the other one on C2, the other one on C5). (2H)\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the C3 position equivalent to the C4 position. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This gives another two distinct sets of protons.\n        *   Set 5: Two equivalent protons (one on C3, one on C4). (2H)\n        *   Set 6: Two equivalent protons (the other one on C3, the other one on C4). (2H)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy summing up the sets of chemically distinct hydrogens, we get:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>"
