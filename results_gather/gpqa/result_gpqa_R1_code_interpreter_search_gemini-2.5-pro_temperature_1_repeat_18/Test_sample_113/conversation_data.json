    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`.\n    *   This is a classic example of cyanohydrin formation. Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack forms an alkoxide intermediate: `CH3CH2C(O⁻)(CN)CH3`.\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent 'A' serves as the proton source.\n    *   The reaction is typically performed by either using HCN directly or by using a salt like NaCN or KCN and then adding an acid. An acid like HCl or H2SO4 will provide H+ ions (represented as H3O+ in aqueous solution) to protonate the alkoxide.\n    *   `CH3CH2C(O⁻)(CN)CH3 + H3O⁺ ---> CH3CH2C(OH)(CN)CH3 + H2O`\n    *   Therefore, a suitable reagent for 'A' is a strong acid, represented by H3O⁺.\n    *   The other option for A is NaHSO3. Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form crystalline bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction and does not lead to a cyanohydrin. Thus, NaHSO3 is incorrect.\n    *   So, we can conclude that **A = H3O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`.\n    *   This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This process is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires harsh conditions and is typically carried out by heating with a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H2SO4. The overall reaction is: `R-C≡N + 2H₂O + H⁺ ---> R-COOH + NH₄⁺`.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base like NaOH. This forms a carboxylate salt (`R-COO⁻Na⁺`), which must then be acidified in a separate step to yield the carboxylic acid (`R-COOH`).\n    *   The question shows the direct formation of the carboxylic acid, which is characteristic of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Reagent 'B' is the catalyst for this hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n    *   Comparing the options for 'B', HCl is a strong acid, while CH3COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. For effective hydrolysis of a nitrile, a strong acid is required.\n    *   Therefore, the suitable reagent for **B is HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is H3O⁺ and reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
