    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\nThis is a cyclohexane ring with three functional groups:\n*   A ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 3.\n*   An isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) at position 5.\n\nThe structure is as follows (stereochemistry is not specified and not relevant for the final connectivity):\n```\n      O\n     //\n   C1 -- C2H2\n  /  \\\nH2C6   C3H -- CH2OH\n |     |\nH2C5 -- C4H2\n |\n C(=CH2)-CH3\n```\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with Sodium Hydride (NaH) followed by Benzyl Bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaH.** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The starting material has a primary alcohol (-OH, pKa ~16) and α-protons to the ketone (pKa ~19-20). The alcohol is significantly more acidic and will be deprotonated by NaH to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Reagent 2: Benzyl Bromide (PhCH2Br or BnBr).** The resulting alkoxide is a good nucleophile. It will react with benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction, a process known as the Williamson ether synthesis, to form a benzyl ether.\n    R-CH2O⁻ Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   The hydroxyl group is thus \"protected\" as a benzyl ether. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone functional group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of an acid catalyst (HCl). The reaction involves the condensation of the ketone with the terminal -NH2 group of the hydrazide, eliminating a molecule of water.\n    R₂C=O + H₂N-NHTs → R₂C=N-NHTs + H₂O\n*   The ketone at C1 is converted to a tosylhydrazone group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of product 1, which is N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)**\n\n*   This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**. The Shapiro reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene by eliminating the tosylhydrazone group.\n*   **Reagent 1: n-BuLi.** Two equivalents of this strong base are required.\n    1.  The first equivalent deprotonates the N-H proton of the hydrazone.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates a proton on the carbon α to the C=N bond (an α-proton). In this case, there are α-protons at C2 and C6. Deprotonation at the less sterically hindered position (C6) is kinetically favored.\n*   The resulting dianion intermediate is unstable and eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group (as lithium p-toluenesulfinate, LiTs) to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The new double bond is formed between C1 and the deprotonated α-carbon (C6).\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous NH4Cl.** This is a mild proton source used to quench the reaction by protonating the vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   The overall result is the reductive deoxygenation of the original ketone to an alkene, with the double bond located at the less substituted position.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2)**\n\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for this process.\n*   **Reduction of Alkenes:** The H₂/Pd-C system will reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds.\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C1=C6) will be reduced, reforming the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The double bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced, converting it to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** This condition also cleaves benzyl ethers. This is a common method for deprotecting alcohols that were protected as benzyl ethers. The C-O bond of the ether is broken, and the group is converted back to an alcohol.\n    R-CH₂-O-Bn + H₂ → R-CH₂OH + Toluene (PhCH₃)\n*   Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The (benzyloxy)methyl group (-CH₂OBn) at C3 becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The isopropenyl group at C5 becomes an isopropyl group (-CH(CH₃)₂).\n*   **Product 4:** The final molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship (i.e., at positions C3 and C5 relative to the original ketone).\n\n**Naming Product 4:**\nThe principal functional group is the alcohol of the hydroxymethyl group. The molecule is named as a substituted methanol. The substituent attached to the methanol carbon is a 3-isopropylcyclohexyl group (numbering the ring starting from the point of attachment).\nTherefore, the name of product 4 is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\nA) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from a different reaction pathway (nucleophilic addition of n-BuLi) and retains the benzyl ether, which should be cleaved by hydrogenation.\nB) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\nC) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This implies the tosylhydrazone group is still present, meaning the Shapiro reaction (Step 3) did not occur.\nD) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the name for the product where the benzyl ether is not cleaved. Hydrogenation with H₂/Pd-C is expected to cleave the benzyl ether.\n\nThe correct product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
