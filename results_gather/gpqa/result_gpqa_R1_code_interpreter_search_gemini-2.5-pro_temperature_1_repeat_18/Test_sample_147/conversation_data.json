    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine, with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n.\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 18.998 g/mol)\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y\n*   n is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196. We can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = (n * M(F) / ɷF) - (n * M(F))\nM(Y) = n * M(F) * (1/ɷF - 1)\nM(Y) = n * 18.998 * (1/0.3196 - 1)\nM(Y) = n * 18.998 * (3.1289 - 1)\nM(Y) = n * 18.998 * 2.1289\nM(Y) ≈ 40.445 * n\n\nNow we can test integer values for n to find a plausible atomic mass M(Y) for an element.\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.4 g/mol (Close to Calcium, Argon)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Very close to Bromine, Br = 79.9 g/mol)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.3 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb = 121.8 g/mol)\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Close to Dysprosium, Dy = 162.5 g/mol)\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.2 g/mol (Close to Mercury, Thallium, Lead)\n\nThe problem states that A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20°C) and oxidizes xenon. This points to a highly reactive, unstable compound, likely an interhalogen or a noble gas compound. Bromine (Br) is an excellent candidate for element Y, as its fluorides are known to be highly reactive.\n\nLet's assume Y = Bromine (Br).\nIf Y=Br, then n=2 gives the best fit for the mass.\nThis would mean A2 is BrF2. This compound exists as an unstable radical. A more stable compound would be BrF3 (n=3). Let's check the mass fraction for BrF3:\nM(Br) = 79.904 g/mol\nM(F) = 18.998 g/mol\nM(BrF3) = 79.904 + 3 * 18.998 = 136.898 g/mol\nɷF(BrF3) = (3 * 18.998) / 136.898 = 56.994 / 136.898 ≈ 0.4163 (41.63%)\nThis is not 31.96%.\n\nLet's reconsider the calculation. If Y=Br, which fluoride has ɷF ≈ 31.96%?\nM(YF_n) = M(Br) / (1 - ɷF) = 79.904 / (1 - 0.3196) = 79.904 / 0.6804 ≈ 117.4 g/mol\nn = (M(YF_n) - M(Y)) / M(F) = (117.4 - 79.9) / 19.0 ≈ 1.97\nThis confirms that the compound A2 is BrF2. Although BrF2 is a radical, in the context of a chemistry problem, it is the most plausible identity for A2 based on the provided mass percentage.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds A1 to A5**\n\nWith Y = Bromine, let's identify the compounds.\n*   **A2 = BrF2**.\n*   **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (BrF2) and fluorine. A plausible reaction would be the decomposition of a higher fluoride. Bromine tetrafluoride, BrF4, exists as an unstable radical and its salts (e.g., CsBrF4). The BrF4 radical could decompose: BrF4 → BrF2 + F2. Let's assume **A1 = BrF4**. A1 also oxidizes Xenon, which is true for bromine fluorides.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of element Y (Bromine). A3 also interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of bromine can yield BrF, BrF3, and BrF5 depending on the conditions. BrF3 and BrF5 are powerful fluorinating agents that react with Xenon. Let's assume **A3 = BrF3** (a very common product).\n    *   Reaction with Xenon: Xe + 2BrF3 → XeF6 + Br2\n*   **A4**: This is the compound whose molecular weight we need to find.\n*   **A5**: Obtained by adding Y (Bromine, Br2) to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A5 decomposes in water. This description strongly points to the formation of a polyhalogen cation. A very well-known reaction is the formation of the tribromide ion (Br3-) from bromine (Br2) and a bromide salt (like KBr). However, the context is fluorine compounds. A similar reaction involves adding Br2 to BrF3 to form the [Br2F]+ cation.\n    *   Reaction: Br2 + BrF3 → [Br2F]+[BrF4]-. This compound, **[Br2F][BrF4]**, fits the description of A5. It's formed from A3 (BrF3) and Y (Br2).\n    *   But the problem states A5 is formed from A4 and Y. Let's re-read: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   This implies the reaction is: A4 + Y → A5.\n    *   If A5 is [Br2F][BrF4], and Y is Br2, then A4 must be BrF3. Wait, this contradicts A3 = BrF3. Let's reconsider.\n\nA key reaction in interhalogen chemistry is the autoionization of BrF3:\n2 BrF3 ⇌ [BrF2]+ + [BrF4]-\nSo, a solution of BrF3 contains these ions. Adding Y (Br2) to BrF3 (let's call it A4) gives A5. What if the reaction is:\nBrF3 + Br2 → [Br2F]+[F]-  ? This is less likely.\n\nLet's assume there is some flexibility in the identities of A3 and A4. Both BrF3 and BrF5 are formed by fluorinating bromine.\nWhat if **A4 = BrF5**? BrF5 is a colorless liquid and a strong fluorinating agent.\nWhat if **A3 = BrF3**?\nLet's check the reaction for A5 again: A4 + Y (1:1 molar ratio) -> A5.\nBrF5 + Br2 -> ? This is not a standard, simple reaction to form a single product A5.\n\nLet's reconsider the formation of A5: Y + A4 -> A5.\nAnd A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\nThe formation of polyhalide anions or cations is a strong possibility. Consider the reaction between a halide and an interhalogen. For instance, the reaction between an alkali fluoride (like KF) and an interhalogen (like BrF3 or BrF5) forms polyhalide anions.\nKF + BrF3 -> K+[BrF4]-\nKF + BrF5 -> K+[BrF6]-\nThe problem says element Y is added, not a salt.\n\nLet's go back to the reaction: Br2 + BrF3 → [Br2F]+[BrF4]-.\nThis reaction fits the stoichiometry (1:1 if you consider the autoionization product) and chemical nature. Let's assign the compounds based on this:\n*   Y = Br2 (as a reactant)\n*   **A4 = BrF3** (The \"hot colorless concentrated solution\")\n*   **A5 = [Br2F][BrF4]** (The product)\n\nLet's check if this fits.\n*   \"A5 decomposes in water with the formation of two substances\".\n    *   [Br2F][BrF4] would react vigorously with water. The hydrolysis of bromine fluorides is complex but generally yields hydrofluoric acid (HF) and various bromine oxyacids (like HBrO3) and bromine itself. So, it does decompose into multiple substances.\n*   This assignment seems chemically sound.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on our deduction in Step 2, the substance A4 is Bromine trifluoride (BrF3).\nNow, we calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Molar mass of Bromine (Br) = 79.904 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) = 18.998 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (BrF3) = M(Br) + 3 * M(F)\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 79.904 + 3 * 18.998\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 79.904 + 56.994\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 136.898 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight is approximately 136.9 g/mol. We now check which of the given ranges this value falls into.\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 136.9 g/mol does not fall neatly into any of these ranges. Let's re-examine our assumptions.\nIs it possible A4 is BrF5?\n*   Molecular Weight of BrF5 = 79.904 + 5 * 18.998 = 79.904 + 94.99 = 174.894 g/mol. This falls into range A) 160-180.\nLet's check if A4=BrF5 is plausible. A5 would be formed from BrF5 + Br2. The product of this reaction is not a simple, well-known 1:1 adduct. The formation of A5 from BrF3 + Br2 is more chemically established.\n\nLet's look at the ranges again. 136.9 is very close to range D (140-160). It is only 3.1 units away from the lower bound. It is 6.9 units away from the upper bound of range C. It's possible there is a slight inaccuracy in the question's options or a rounding convention is expected.\n\nLet's re-verify the element Y. What if Y = Antimony (Sb)?\n*   M(Y) for n=3 was 121.3 g/mol, very close to Sb (121.8).\n*   A2 = SbF3. ɷF = (3 * 19) / (121.8 + 57) = 57 / 178.8 ≈ 31.88%. This is an excellent match for 31.96%.\n*   So, Y = Antimony (Sb).\n*   Antimony fluorides: SbF3, SbF5. (Only two, not five. This contradicts the first sentence).\n*   Let's ignore the \"five compounds\" rule for a moment, as it's often a distractor.\n*   A1: Decomposes to A2 (SbF3) and F2. This would mean A1 is SbF5. SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2. SbF5 is a colorless fuming liquid/solid, not red. This contradicts A1 being red.\nSo, Antimony is not the element Y.\n\nThe identification of Y=Bromine seems the most robust, despite the minor discrepancy with BrF2's stability and the number of compounds. The chemical descriptions fit well. The most likely scenario is that A4 is BrF3 and the provided ranges are slightly off or require rounding. However, if we must choose the best fit, 136.9 is closest to the range 140-160.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility of A4=BrF5. M(BrF5) = 174.9 g/mol. This fits perfectly in range A (160-180). Why might A4 be BrF5? BrF5 is a colorless liquid, which fits the description of a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". If A4=BrF5, what is A5? Perhaps the problem intended a reaction with an alkali fluoride, not element Y. If the question meant a fluoride of Y (like NaY if Y was a halogen), the logic would shift. But it says \"adding Y\".\n\nGiven the ambiguity, let's re-evaluate the two possibilities for A4:\n1.  **A4 = BrF3**: MW = 136.9 g/mol. Chemically sound derivation for A5. MW is very close to range D.\n2.  **A4 = BrF5**: MW = 174.9 g/mol. Fits range A perfectly. A5 formation is unclear.\n\nLet's revisit the prompt. Maybe there's a mistake in my logic.\nA5 is obtained by adding Y to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\nA5 is BrF3. A4 is BrF5. Y is BrF? Br2 + F2 -> 2BrF.\nBrF5 + BrF -> [BrF2]+[BrF4]- ? Stoichiometry seems plausible.\nThis would make the five compounds BrF, BrF2, BrF3, BrF4, BrF5.\nThis seems like a consistent set of compounds for Bromine.\nIf Y=BrF, it's not an element. The problem states \"element Y\". This path is incorrect.\n\nThe most straightforward interpretation remains:\nY = Br (element)\nA4 = BrF3 (MW ~ 137) or A4 = BrF5 (MW ~ 175)\nA5 is formed by A4 + Br2.\nThe reaction BrF3 + Br2 -> [Br2F][BrF4] is more established than a 1:1 reaction with BrF5. This strongly supports A4=BrF3.\nTherefore, the molecular weight is ~137 g/mol. This value does not fit well in any range. However, it is closest to range D [140-160]. It's possible the question considers Br to have an atomic mass of 80, leading to MW= 80 + 3*19 = 137.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my identification of A4. Is there another possibility?\nWhat if the \"solution\" is an inert solvent and A4 is the solute? What if Y is a solid?\nThis overcomplicates the problem. The simplest chemical interpretation points towards A4 being BrF3. Given the choices, D is the most plausible, assuming a slight error in the range's boundary.\n\nLet's check the options again.\nA) 160-180 (Corresponds to BrF5)\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130 (Corresponds to BrF, but that's a gas)\nD) 140-160 (Closest to BrF3)\n\nThe choice is between A and D. The formation of A5 (A4 + Br2 -> A5) is the key. The formation of [Br2F][BrF4] from BrF3 is a known reaction. Let's assume this is the intended path. This makes A4=BrF3 and MW=137. This value is 3.1 away from range D and 6.9 away from range C. Range D is the closer one.\n\nFinal check: What if A2 is BrF? ɷF = 19 / (80+19) = 19/99 = 19.2%. No.\nThe identity of A2 as BrF2 (or a compound with this empirical formula) is the most solid starting point. This firmly points to Y=Br. The subsequent deductions lead to A4=BrF3. The slight mismatch with the ranges is likely an issue with the problem's design, but D is the closest answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
