    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X and related compounds.**\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting Point of B.** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (277 K = 3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K), while normal water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This is a strong indication that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**. The heavier isotope mentioned in the first sentence is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B.** B (D₂O) is released when a precipitate G is heated. This is characteristic of the dehydration of a metal hydroxide. Since the final product is D₂O, the precipitate G must be a deuterated hydroxide, like M(OD)n. The heating reaction would be: `2 M(OD)n → M₂On + n D₂O`.\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X with Y.** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce precipitate G and a gas W. Given that G is a deuterated hydroxide, it's formed from the reaction of a highly reactive substance X with deuterated water (D₂O). So, **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction would be: `X + D₂O → G (M(OD)n) + W (gas)`.\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W.** The gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine the reaction `X + D₂O`. If X is a metal deuteride, the gas produced would be D₂.\n        *   Let's check D₂ (Deuterium gas): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n    *   **Clue 5: Substance X Identity.** We know X is a deuteride that reacts with D₂O to form a deuterated hydroxide and D₂ gas. We also know that X and its analog are used in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog, used for isotopic labeling, is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n        *   This reaction is violent. It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), and a gas, D₂. Heating the precipitate Al(OD)₃ gives Aluminum oxide and D₂O (B). This is fully consistent with all the clues.\n    *   **Clue 6: Keto Acid Reaction.** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce a keto acid (which has a ketone group, -CO-, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH) to a hydroxy acid (e.g., R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms. This final clue confirms the identity of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass.**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** We compare the mass of a single atom of each element (using the mass number of the most common/relevant isotopes).\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (²H): 2 amu\n        *   Mass of Lithium (⁷Li): 7 amu\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (²⁷Al): 27 amu\n        *   Therefore, the **lightest element is Deuterium (D)** and the **heaviest element is Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present... considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n        *   **Mass of the lightest element (Deuterium):** There are four atoms of Deuterium in LiAlD₄. The total mass is 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n        *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The total mass is 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n        *   **Cumulative Sum:** Summing these two values gives: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer.**\n    The calculated cumulative mass is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
