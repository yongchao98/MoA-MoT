    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information from the problem description.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula C6H4. The four protons on the ring account for the aromatic signals.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... shows ... an ester group\"**: This means the molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This group has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR data to identify molecular fragments.**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This is consistent with the C6H4 group. For example, a 1,4- (para) di-substituted ring would typically show two signals for its four aromatic protons (an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two doublets). This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's denote it as -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This fragment accounts for two vinyl hydrogens and one methyl group.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester functionality. The two possibilities for an ester group containing a methyl group are a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-O-CO-CH3**). Both possibilities add one methyl group to the structure.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate other possible structures. For example, we can rule out ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3), propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl groups (-CH2-CH=CH2).\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments to build the complete molecule and determine its formula.**\n    *   We have the following pieces:\n        *   A C6H4 aromatic ring.\n        *   A -CH=CH-CH3 (propenyl) group.\n        *   An ester group containing a methyl group (either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3).\n\n    *   Let's assemble these pieces. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n        *   **Possibility 1**: The substituents are -CH=CH-CH3 and -COOCH3.\n        *   **Possibility 2**: The substituents are -CH=CH-CH3 and -O-CO-CH3.\n\n    *   Now, let's calculate the molecular formula for these structures.\n        *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3) = **11 carbons**.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 4 (from the ring) + 2 (vinyl H's from propenyl) + 3 (methyl H's from propenyl) + 3 (methyl H's from the ester) = 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = **12 hydrogens**.\n        *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and a C=O double bond (DoU = 1).\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming its validity.\n\n5.  **Compare the derived formula with the given options.**\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The other options are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would likely lack the vinyl C=C bond, and formulas with 12 carbons or 14 hydrogens would either violate the \"no -CH2-\" rule or contradict the NMR splitting patterns described.\n\n<<<C>>>"
