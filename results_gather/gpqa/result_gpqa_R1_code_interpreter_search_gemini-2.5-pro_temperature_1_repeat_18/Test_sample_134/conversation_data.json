    "The user wants to find the kinematically allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n**1. Understand the Interaction and Decay Process**\n\nThe interaction between the boson X and a fermion field $\\psi_f$ is given by the Lagrangian term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nThis Lagrangian describes how the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. The relevant term for the decay of X is the one containing the field X:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{decay} = -\\lambda_f X(y) \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) \\psi_f(y)$\n\nThis term corresponds to a vertex where a boson X annihilates into a fermion $f$ and its antifermion $\\bar{f}$. The decay process at the lowest order is therefore:\n$X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$\n\n**2. Apply the Kinematic Condition**\n\nFor any decay to be \"kinematically allowed,\" the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final particles. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy and momentum.\nFor the decay $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the condition is:\n$m_X \\geq m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n\nA particle and its antiparticle have identical masses, so $m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$. The condition simplifies to:\n$m_X \\geq 2m_f$\n\nThe problem states that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6$ GeV. Therefore, a decay to a fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ is allowed only if the fermion's mass $m_f$ satisfies:\n$6 \\text{ GeV} \\geq 2m_f$\nor\n$m_f \\leq 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**3. Check Fermion Masses**\n\nNow, we need to check this condition for all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons). We will use the approximate masses for these particles.\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   Up (u): $m_u \\approx 2.2$ MeV/c² = 0.0022 GeV/c². Since $0.0022 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Down (d): $m_d \\approx 4.7$ MeV/c² = 0.0047 GeV/c². Since $0.0047 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Strange (s): $m_s \\approx 95$ MeV/c² = 0.095 GeV/c². Since $0.095 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Charm (c): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV/c². Since $1.27 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Bottom (b): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV/c². Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n    *   Top (t): $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV/c². Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   Electron (e): $m_e \\approx 0.511$ MeV/c² = 0.000511 GeV/c². Since $0.000511 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7$ MeV/c² = 0.1057 GeV/c². Since $0.1057 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n    *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1.777$ GeV/c². Since $1.777 < 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n(Note: Neutrino masses are extremely small and well below the 3 GeV threshold, so their decays would be allowed but are not included in the options, which is typical for such problems.)\n\n**4. Compile the List of Allowed Decays and Compare with Options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the set of kinematically allowed decays into quark-antiquark and charged lepton-antilepton pairs is:\n$\\{ X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}, X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}, X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}, X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}, X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-} \\}$\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n\n*   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\n    *   This option incorrectly includes the decay to a bottom-antibottom quark pair ($b\\bar{b}$), which is forbidden.\n\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\n    *   This option incorrectly includes the decay to a top-antitop quark pair ($t\\bar{t}$), which is forbidden.\n\n*   C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\n    *   This option includes all the decays we identified as kinematically allowed and excludes the forbidden ones. This matches our result perfectly.\n\n*   D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$\n    *   This option incorrectly includes the forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ decay and omits the allowed $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
