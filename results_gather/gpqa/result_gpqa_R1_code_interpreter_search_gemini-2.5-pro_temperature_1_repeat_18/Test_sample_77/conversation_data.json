    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the field measured at a point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, `tr`, called the \"retarded time\".\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Relationships\n\n*   `q`: the point charge.\n*   `r`: the observation point (field point).\n*   `s(t)`: the trajectory of the charge.\n*   `tr`: the retarded time, the time at which the field was emitted from the charge to reach `r` at time `t`.\n*   `s(tr)`: the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v = ds/dt |_{t=tr}`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `d = r - s(tr)`: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `d = |d|`: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   `c`: the speed of light.\n*   `ε₀`: the permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: the permeability of free space.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is defined implicitly by the relation that the time `t` is the sum of the retarded time `tr` and the time it takes for the light to travel the distance `d`:\n`t = tr + d/c`\n`t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n### 2. Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general formulas for the potentials in terms of charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are the retarded potential integrals:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr)] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the densities are:\n`ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n`J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integral formulas and evaluating them is a standard, but non-trivial, procedure in electromagnetism. The complication arises because the retarded time `tr` inside the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 3. Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe evaluation of the integrals gives the following expressions for the scalar and vector potentials:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d(1 - (\\hat{d} ⋅ v) / c))]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d(1 - (\\hat{d} ⋅ v) / c))]_ret`\n\nwhere `\\hat{d} = d / d` is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observation point, and the `_ret` subscript indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `\\hat{d}`, `v`) are to be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n### 4. Simplifying the Expressions\n\nLet's rewrite the denominator term:\n`d(1 - (\\hat{d} ⋅ v) / c) = d - d(\\hat{d} ⋅ v) / c`\nSince `d\\hat{d} = d` (the vector), the term becomes:\n`d - (d ⋅ v) / c`\n\nNow, let's substitute this back into the potential formulas:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q v) / (d - (d ⋅ v) / c)`\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc v) / (dc - d ⋅ v)`\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, and the relation for A is dimensionally incorrect (v² is a scalar).\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This has a `+` sign in the denominator. This would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" (effects preceding their cause), which are typically excluded on grounds of causality. Our derivation, for retarded potentials (`t > tr`), yields a `-` sign.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. Again, the scalar potential is the static one, which is not generally correct for a moving charge. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    These expressions exactly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The denominator `(dc - d ⋅ v)` is correct for retarded potentials. The relation `A = (v/c²)V` also holds for these expressions, since `μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²`.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly represents the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<D>>>"
