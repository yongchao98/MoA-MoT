    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the initial state `|alpha>`\n\nThe state of the electron is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet the state be `|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`, where C is the normalization constant.\n\nIn the standard basis where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = C * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\nFor a state to be normalized, the inner product `<alpha|alpha>` must equal 1.\n`<alpha|` is the conjugate transpose of `|alpha>`, so:\n`<alpha| = C* * [ (1-i), (2+i) ]`\n\nNow, we compute `<alpha|alpha>`:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]`\n\nLet's calculate the terms:\n*   `(1-i)(1+i) = 1^2 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2`\n*   `(2+i)(2-i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5`\n\nSo, `<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * (2 + 5) = 7|C|^2`.\nSince `<alpha|alpha> = 1`, we have `7|C|^2 = 1`, which gives `|C|^2 = 1/7`. We can choose the real, positive constant `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn vector form:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ 1+i, 2-i ]^T`\n\n### 2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues\n\nThe matrix representation of the operator A is given by `Aij = hbar/2` if `i != j`, and `Aij = 0` otherwise. For a 2-level system (spin up/down), this is a 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is `(hbar/2) * sigma_x`, where `sigma_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`lambda`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]]) = 0`\n`(-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda^2 = (hbar^2)/4`\nThe eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\n*   **For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:**\n    `(A - lambda_1*I) |v1> = 0`\n    `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [a, b]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `-(hbar/2)*a + (hbar/2)*b = 0`, which simplifies to `a = b`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v1> = (1/sqrt(1^2 + 1^2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n*   **For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:**\n    `(A - lambda_2*I) |v2> = 0`\n    `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [a, b]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `(hbar/2)*a + (hbar/2)*b = 0`, which simplifies to `a = -b`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v2> = (1/sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P(lambda_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:**\n    `P(+hbar/2) = |<v1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v1| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i))`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(+hbar/2) = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14`\n    `9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:**\n    `P(-hbar/2) = |<v2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v2| = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i))`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(-hbar/2) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14`\n    `5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\nAs a check, the sum of probabilities is `9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the average (expectation) value of A\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues**\n    `<A> = P(lambda_1) * lambda_1 + P(lambda_2) * lambda_2`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    `<A> = ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] ) * ( (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] ) * ( (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T )`\n    `<A> = (hbar / (2 * 7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i^2) + (2 + 2i + i + i^2)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are **9/14 (≈0.64)** and **5/14 (≈0.36)**.\nThe average value of the operator A is **hbar/7**.\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
