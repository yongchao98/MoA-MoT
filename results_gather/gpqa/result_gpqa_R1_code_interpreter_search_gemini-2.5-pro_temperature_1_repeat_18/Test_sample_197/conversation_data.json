    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate its mole fraction among all cobalt-containing species and then convert it to a percentage.\n\n**1. Identify the species and equilibria**\n\nThe cobalt(II) ions `Co^2+` react with thiocyanate ions `SCN-` to form a series of complexes. The equilibria for the formation of these complexes from the free metal ion and ligand are described by the overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4 SCN- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Express total cobalt concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN-]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `c(Co)` gives:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**3. Determine the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`, and the total thiocyanate concentration is `c(SCN) = 0.1 M`. Since the thiocyanate concentration is in large excess compared to the cobalt concentration (10 times higher), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is small compared to the total amount. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]` as being equal to its total concentration:\n`[SCN-] ≈ c(SCN) = 0.1 M`\n\n**4. Calculate the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`**\n\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, denoted as `α_n`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. For the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)2]` (n=2), the fraction `α2` is:\n\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\nBy canceling `[Co^2+]`, we get:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**5. Substitute the values and compute**\n\nNow we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nWe will calculate the value of each term in the denominator polynomial `P = 1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4`:\n*   `1`\n*   `β1[SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β2[SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β3[SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β4[SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n`P = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex:\n`Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 0.4`\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nWe can also use python to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Given stability constants and concentrations\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The term in the distribution formula for the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)2]) is the numerator.\nnumerator_term = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms from Co^2+ to [Co(SCN)4]^2-\ndenominator_sum = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# The fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_co_scn2 = numerator_term / denominator_sum\n\n# The percentage\npercentage_co_scn2 = fraction_co_scn2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_co_scn2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is distributed among several species: the free aquated ion `Co^2+` and a series of thiocyanato complexes. The formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β_n):\n\n*   `Co^2+` (we can consider this as `[Co(SCN)0]` with β_0 = 1)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]^+` with `β1 = 9`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]` with `β2 = 40`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^-` with `β3 = 63`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-` with `β4 = 16`\n\n**2. Formulate the mole fraction equation**\n\nThe mole fraction (α_n) of a particular complex `[Co(SCN)n]` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. The formula for the mole fraction of the n-th complex is:\n\n`α_n = (β_n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nWe are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, so we need to calculate `α_2`.\n\n`α_2 = (β_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-]^1 + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**3. Approximate the free ligand concentration**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is `10^-2 M` (0.01 M), and the total thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]_total` is `0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is in 10-fold excess compared to the metal ion concentration, the concentration of the free ligand `[SCN-]` can be approximated as the total ligand concentration.\n`[SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**4. Calculate the mole fraction (α_2)**\n\nNow we substitute the given values into the equation for `α_2`:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms):\n*   Term 0 (for Co^2+): `1`\n*   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]^+): `β1 * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * (0.1)^1 = 0.9`\n*   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)2]): `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)3]^-): `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)4]^2-): `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex, which we already calculated as `0.4`.\n\nNow, we can find the mole fraction `α_2`:\n`α_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**5. Convert to percentage**\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe python code executed previously confirms this calculation, giving a result of 16.916%. Comparing this with the given options, 16.9% matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
