    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Set Up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio**\n\nWe can simplify this expression based on the information given in the problem:\n*   `T_star` is the same for both planets, so it cancels out.\n*   `R_star` is the same for both planets, so it cancels out.\n*   The factor of 2 cancels out.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`), so the term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` also cancels out.\n\nAfter simplification, the ratio becomes:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means to find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**5. Relate Doppler Shift to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is caused by the star's radial velocity (v_r) as it's pulled by the orbiting planet. The relationship is:\nv_r = c * (Δλ / λ0)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = v_r_max = (M_p / M_star) * v_p\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity.\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity (`v_p`) is given by:\nv_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n(We can approximate the total mass M_star + M_p ≈ M_star since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's).\n\nSubstituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n**6. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a)**\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for `a`:\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n**7. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nSince K = v_r_max = c * (Δλ_max / λ0), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2\n\n**8. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nRatio of masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\nRatio of Doppler shifts: Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nCalculate a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures using the result from step 4:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes squared\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (delta_lambda1/delta_lambda2)^2\nM_p2_over_M_p1 = 5 / 7\ndelta_lambda1_over_delta_lambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\na2_over_a1 = (M_p2_over_M_p1)**2 * (delta_lambda1_over_delta_lambda2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of a2/a1\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(T_eq1_over_T_eq2)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1). We can determine this from the radial velocity data. The maximum radial velocity (velocity semi-amplitude, K) of a star induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n\nHowever, a more direct formula relating K, M_p, M_star and `a` is:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSolving for `a`:\nK^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nThe radial velocity `v_r` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by `v_r / c = Δλ / λ0`. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_Earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_Earth\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (0.03 / 0.04)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
