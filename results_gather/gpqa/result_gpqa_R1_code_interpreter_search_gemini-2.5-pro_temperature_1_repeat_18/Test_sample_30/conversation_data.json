    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of Product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nitration of toluene, an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃), Nitric Acid (HNO₃), and Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) will primarily add to the positions ortho (2 and 6) or para (4) to the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** The para product is generally the major product due to reduced steric hindrance compared to the ortho product. Therefore, we can assume **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene), Manganese Dioxide (MnO₂), and Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** MnO₂ in an acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the benzylic methyl group. This oxidation can proceed all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) or, under milder/controlled conditions, stop at the aldehyde (-CHO) stage. For the subsequent reaction in Step 3 to be a plausible C-C bond formation, we will assume the reaction yields the aldehyde. The formation of p-nitrobenzaldehyde is a known transformation, although oxidation to the carboxylic acid is also common.\n*   **Product 2:** Assuming oxidation to the aldehyde, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n*   **Reagents:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde), Acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O), and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The strong base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate ion (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`).\n    2.  p-Nitrobenzaldehyde does not have any α-protons, so it cannot form an enolate. It can only act as the electrophile.\n    3.  The acetone enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    4.  This forms a β-hydroxy ketone intermediate, which readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under the basic conditions to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n     \n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure of Product 3 is `p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃`. The extensive system of pi-bonds (nitro group, benzene ring, alkene, ketone) favors a planar arrangement of the molecule's backbone to maximize conjugation.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** If we consider the backbone of the molecule to be planar, this plane acts as a mirror plane. Atoms lying in the plane are mapped onto themselves, and atoms above the plane are reflected to identical atoms below the plane (and vice-versa).\n    *   **Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** There is no rotational axis (other than C₁, which is trivial). The molecule is not symmetric upon rotation by 180° (C₂) or any other angle.\n    *   **Inversion Center (i):** There is no center of inversion. The two ends of the molecule are different (a nitro group on one side, an acetyl group on the other).\n\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Alternative Pathway Check**\n\nEven if we consider an alternative pathway where:\n1.  Product 1 is o-nitrotoluene (a minor but significant nitration product).\n2.  Product 2 is o-nitrobenzoic acid (full oxidation).\n3.  Product 3 is the o-nitrobenzoate anion (from deprotonation by NaOH).\nThis molecule, assuming it is planar, also only has a single plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule) and thus also belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nSince both plausible reaction pathways lead to a product with Cs symmetry, we can be confident in this answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
