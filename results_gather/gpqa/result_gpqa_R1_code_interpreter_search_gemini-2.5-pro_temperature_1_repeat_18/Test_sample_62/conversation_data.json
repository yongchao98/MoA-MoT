    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Model and the States\n\n*   **Model:** The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n    E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1)\n    where:\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n    *   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ...\n    *   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   Initial Energy: E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State and Transition:** The question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" In the context of photon absorption spectroscopy, we must consider the selection rules. For rovibrational transitions, the rules are:\n    *   Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   ΔJ = ±1\n    The \"next state\" implies a transition from the ground vibrational level (v=0) to the first excited vibrational level (v=1). Starting from the ground rotational state (J=0), the only allowed transition is to J=1 (since J cannot be negative, ΔJ=-1 is not possible).\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1).\n    *   Final Energy: E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n### 2. Calculating the Photon Energy\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   ΔE_photon = E_final - E_initial\n*   ΔE_photon = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\n*   ΔE_photon = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nThis energy is the sum of the fundamental vibrational energy gap (ħω) and the energy for the J=0 to J=1 rotational transition (ħ²/I).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Photon Momentum\n\nThe momentum `p` of a photon is related to its energy `E` by the formula `p = E/c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   p = (ħω + ħ²/I) / c\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\nTo get the final answer, we need to calculate `I` and then `p`.\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the reduced mass (μ)**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    First, convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg). 1 amu ≈ 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n    *   Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg = 3.321 × 10⁻²⁶ kg\n    *   My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg = 3.321 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   μ = (3.321 × 10⁻²⁶ * 3.321 × 10⁻²⁷) / (3.321 × 10⁻²⁶ + 3.321 × 10⁻²⁷) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)**\n    I = μ * R²\n    First, convert the bond length `R` from angstroms (Å) to meters (m). 1 Å = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n    *   R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   I = (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the two energy components**\n    *   Vibrational energy part: ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   Rotational energy part: ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.19 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Step D: Calculate total photon energy and momentum**\n    *   ΔE_photon = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot = 4.216 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00919 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   p = ΔE_photon / c = (4.225 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.409 × 10⁻²⁸ kg·m/s (or N·s)\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated momentum is approximately 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s. This value matches option C.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.0545718e-34  # J*s\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27 # kg\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10 # m\nc = 2.99792458e8 # m/s\n\n# Given values\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR_angstrom = 2.0\nw = 4.0e14 # rad/s\n\n# Convert to SI units\nMx = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\n\n# Calculate reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n\n# Calculate moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * R**2\n\n# Calculate the energy of the R(0) transition (v=0, J=0 -> v=1, J=1)\n# Delta_E = h_bar*w + h_bar^2/I\nE_photon = (h_bar * w) + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# Calculate the photon momentum\np_photon = E_photon / c\n\nprint(f\"{p_photon:.3e}\")\n```\nThe code output is `1.410e-28`, which confirms the result.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the momentum of a photon that can excite a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.\n\n### 1. Define the Energy Model\nThe energy of the molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n- `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n- `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n- `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n- `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n- `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n### 2.

Calculate Photon Momentum (p)\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p = ΔE / c, where `c` is the speed of light.\np = (ħω + ħ²/I) / c\n\n### 5. Perform the Calculation\nTo find the numerical value, we first need to calculate the moment of inertia, `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n\n- **Convert Units:**\n  - Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n  - My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n  - R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n- **Calculate Reduced Mass (μ):**\n  μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n  μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 1.818 amu ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n- **Calculate Moment of Inertia (I):**\n  I = μR² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n- **Calculate Energy Components:**\n  - Vibrational part: ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n  - Rotational part: ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n- **Calculate Total Energy and Momentum:**\n  - ΔE = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n  - p = ΔE / c = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated value of 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
