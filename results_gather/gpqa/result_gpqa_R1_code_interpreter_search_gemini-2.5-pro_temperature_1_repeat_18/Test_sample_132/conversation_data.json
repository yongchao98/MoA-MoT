    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species in the solution.**\n    *   KH₂PO₄ is a salt that dissociates completely in water to form K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate) ions.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is a hydrated salt that dissociates completely in water to form 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate) ions, and 2H₂O.\n    *   We have a mixture of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), which constitutes a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol.\n\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.**\n    The buffer system is based on the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻, with the acid dissociation constant Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\n    The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.10x10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, with the acid dissociation constant Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n    The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n    Now, we plug in the values we've calculated. We use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (0.02809 M) and the calculated [H⁺] (8.10x10⁻⁸ M), as the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible due to the very small value of Ka₃.\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.10x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculation can be performed using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / volume_L  # [H2PO4-]\n\nmoles_HPO4_2 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2 = moles_HPO4_2 / volume_L  # [HPO4^2-]\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# From the equilibrium H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4_2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# From the equilibrium HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3 = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2 / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n*   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n*   In water, these salts dissociate completely:\n    *   KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O\n*   This creates a buffer system consisting of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n\n**2. Phosphoric Acid Equilibria**\nThe problem involves the three dissociation steps of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ ; Ka₁ = 7.5x10⁻³\n2.  H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n3.  HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n*   The buffer's pH is primarily controlled by the second equilibrium (Ka₂), as both H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are present in significant amounts.\n*   The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka₃).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation Plan**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Calculate the moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n    *   Divide the moles by the solution volume (in Liters) to get the concentrations of [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻].\n*   **Step B: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer.**\n    *   Use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻].\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [H⁺]. The initial concentrations from Step A can be used as the equilibrium concentrations, a standard and valid assumption for buffer calculations.\n*   **Step C: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\n    *   Use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻].\n    *   Rearrange to solve for [PO₄³⁻], using the [H⁺] from Step B and the concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] from Step A.\n\n**4. Executing the Plan with Code**\nTo ensure accuracy, let's perform these calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_cm3 = 200.00\nvolume_L = volume_cm3 / 1000.0  # Convert cm3 to L\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step A: Calculate initial concentrations of buffer components [H2PO4-] and [HPO4^2-]\nmoles_KH2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconcentration_H2PO4_minus = moles_KH2PO4 / volume_L\n\nmoles_Na2HPO4_2H2O = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconcentration_HPO4_2_minus = moles_Na2HPO4_2H2O / volume_L\n\n# Step B: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconcentration_H_plus = Ka2 * (concentration_H2PO4_minus / concentration_HPO4_2_minus)\n\n# Step C: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconcentration_PO4_3_minus = Ka3 * (concentration_HPO4_2_minus / concentration_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to match the answer choices\nprint(f\"{concentration_PO4_3_minus:.2e}\")\n```\n>>>6.24e-07\n\nThe output from the code is `6.24e-07`, which represents a concentration of 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.
