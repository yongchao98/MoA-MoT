    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars by `N`. The problem states that the number of stars \"varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   In astrophysics and statistics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it usually refers to the differential distribution or density. So, the given information is about the number of stars per unit interval of parallax. We can write this as:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars \"changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the number of stars per unit interval of distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) and astronomical distance (`r`) are inversely related. The standard formula is:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n    *   Here, `r` is typically in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Use the Chain Rule for Derivatives:**\n    *   We have a function in terms of `plx` (`dN/d(plx)`) and we want to find the corresponding function in terms of `r` (`dN/dr`). We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Term `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    *   We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance.\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate it with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now we substitute the given relationship and the derivative we just calculated into the chain rule equation.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r²)`\n    *   The equation is now in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need to express it solely in terms of `r`. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/(1/r)^5) * (-1/r²)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us about the proportionality. The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is a physical density, which must be a positive quantity. The negative sign arises because as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (their differentials `dr` and `d(plx)` have opposite signs).\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the relationship is what matters. The number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r³`.\n        `dN/dr ~ r³`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The derived relationship `~ r³` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
