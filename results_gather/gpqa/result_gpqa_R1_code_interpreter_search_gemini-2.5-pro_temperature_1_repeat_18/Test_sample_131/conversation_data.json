    "This problem requires analyzing the 1H NMR spectra of several isomers of tetramethylbenzene and one isomer of diethylbenzene to determine which two are present in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each possible compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the symmetry plane) (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the symmetry plane) (3H).\n        *   This results in three distinct **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons are at C5 and C6. They are adjacent to each other. They will couple, producing a pair of doublets (an AX system), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **ruled out** because it does not produce aromatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups (-CH2-CH3) will show spin-spin coupling. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet, and the -CH3- protons will be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **ruled out** because the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1:1 mixture of the valid candidates:**\nThe only two compounds that fit the \"singlets only\" criteria are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   Since the two compounds are different, their aromatic protons will have slightly different chemical shifts. The result is two singlets. As the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H).\n    *   The problem states that only three signals are observed in the alkyl region. This implies an accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The total number of parts in the ratio is 2+1+1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Let's match these required integrals (12H, 6H, 6H) with the signals from our two compounds:\n        *   The 12H signal comes from the single methyl signal of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The 6H signal comes from the equivalent C1/C3 methyl groups of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n        *   The remaining 6H signal must come from the overlap of the two 3H signals (from C2 and C5 methyls) of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. While the C2 and C5 methyls are not equivalent by symmetry, it is common for signals with similar chemical environments to overlap accidentally. *Correction*: In the spectrum of the mixture, this 6H signal could also arise from an overlap of a signal from one compound with a signal from the other. However, the most straightforward explanation that generates signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H from the available signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) is the one described. The key is that the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone (6H, 3H, 3H) have the same ratio (2:1:1) as the observed signals in the mixture, but the presence of the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene alters the overall integration. The given 2:1:1 ratio refers to the final combined spectrum, which must integrate to 12H:6H:6H.\n    *   The combination of signals from these two compounds is the only one that can produce the observed spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two compounds in the mixture must be 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
