    "This problem requires us to determine which of the given stars can be observed by two specific instruments: the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory.\n\nA star must satisfy two conditions to be observable by **both** instruments:\n\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star must be visible in the sky from both observatory locations. The Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere (Chile, latitude ~24.6° S), and the Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere (Hawaii, latitude ~19.8° N). The problem states to disregard pointing limits, which is interpreted as a star being visible as long as it rises above the horizon. A star with declination (DEC) is visible from a location with latitude (lat) if `|lat - DEC| < 90°`.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent brightness (apparent V magnitude) must be within the detection limits of both instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17 mag.\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16 mag.\n    *   To be detected by **both**, the star must satisfy the stricter condition, which is **V < 16 mag**.\n\nWe will now analyze each star against these two conditions. For stars where the apparent magnitude (V) is not given, we will calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the interstellar absorption. The absorption is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's run the calculations for each star.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_star(name, dec, Mv=None, V=None, d=None, EBV=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a star is observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n    Returns:\n        A formatted string with the analysis results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Observatory latitudes\n    lat_paranal = -24.6  # Paranal, Chile\n    lat_keck = 19.8      # Keck, Hawaii\n\n    # Combined magnitude limit for both observatories\n    mag_limit_both = 16.0\n\n    # 1.

    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star's declination (DEC) must allow it to be seen from both the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ -24.6°) and the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ≈ +19.8°). Ignoring telescope pointing limits, a star is visible if it rises above the horizon. This condition is met if `|latitude - declination| < 90°`.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (V) must be brighter than the limit for **both** instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: V < 17 mag\n    *   HIRES limit: V < 16 mag\n    *   Therefore, the combined requirement is **V < 16 mag**.\n\nIf the apparent magnitude is not given, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula: `V = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`, where `M` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the absorption, given by `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nLet's evaluate each star based on the analysis from the code output:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. It is not visible from Keck (`|19.8° - (-75°)| = 94.8° > 90°`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = 55°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than the HIRES limit of 16 mag.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = 48°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** Calculated V = 16.74 mag (`V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10) - 5 + (3.1*0.4) = 16.74`). This is not brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = 60°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** Calculated V = 14.99 mag (`V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5) - 5 = 14.99`). This is brighter than the 16 mag limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\nThe analysis shows that only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<A>>>"
