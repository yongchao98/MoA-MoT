    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Determine the Structure of the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we analyze the provided NMR spectra of the product to deduce its structure. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. The reaction is an isomerization (rearrangement), so the product has the same molecular formula.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is highly characteristic of a **carbonyl carbon (C=O)**, specifically from a conjugated ketone. This tells us the product is a ketone.\n    *   There are signals corresponding to an aromatic ring (in the ~120-150 ppm range) and aliphatic carbons (δ 21.3, 28.4).\n    *   The total number of carbons is 1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11, which matches the molecular formula.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)**: These are two separate singlet signals, each integrating to 3 protons. This indicates two methyl (CH3) groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons. A methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3) typically appears as a singlet around 2.1-2.4 ppm. A methyl group attached to an aromatic ring (a tolyl group) appears as a singlet around 2.3-2.4 ppm.\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a **para-substituted benzene ring**. The significant chemical shift difference between them suggests one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)**: These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, indicate a disubstituted carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The protons are coupled to each other. Their chemical shifts are in the vinyl region.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a ketone: `C=O`\n    2.  We have a p-substituted benzene ring with a methyl group. This is a p-tolyl group: `CH3-C6H4-`. This accounts for one of the methyl singlets (e.g., δ 2.31 ppm).\n    3.  We have another methyl group, likely an acetyl group: `-C(=O)CH3`. This accounts for the other methyl singlet (e.g., δ 2.28 ppm).\n    4.  We have a vinyl group: `-CH=CH-`.\n    5.  Let's combine these fragments to match the molecular formula C11H12O.\n        *   `p-tolyl-` (C7H7) + `-CH=CH-` (C2H2) + `-C(=O)CH3` (C2H3O) = C11H12O.\n    6.  The structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one** (also known as p-methylbenzylideneacetone).\n\n         \n\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data. The p-tolyl group is connected to the vinyl group, which is in turn conjugated with the ketone. This extended conjugation explains the chemical shifts of the vinyl and aromatic protons.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options for Compound X**\n\nNow we must identify which of the given starting materials (Compound X) would yield this product. The key is that the product contains a **p-tolyl group**. The starting material must also contain this group, as the reaction conditions (heating with a base) will not add a methyl group to a phenyl ring.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound contains a **phenyl group (C6H5-)**, not a p-tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a styryl group, which has a **phenyl group (C6H5-)**, not a p-tolyl group. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** This is a common name for a compound that also contains a **phenyl group** and has the formula C10H10O, which is incorrect. Therefore, it cannot be Compound X.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-`. This is a **p-tolylvinyl group**. This compound contains the required p-tolyl moiety and has the correct molecular formula, C11H12O. Its structure is:\n\n     \n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBy a process of elimination, Compound X must be **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they lack the p-methyl group that is present in the final product. Only option D has the correct carbon skeleton and substituents to form the identified product through an isomerization reaction. The reaction is an example of an epoxide-to-ketone rearrangement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
