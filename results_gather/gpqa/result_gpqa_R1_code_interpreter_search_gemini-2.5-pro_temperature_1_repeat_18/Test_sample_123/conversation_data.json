    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand Particle Decay:** The decay of a population of unstable particles is an exponential process. The number of particles `N` remaining at time `t` from an initial population `N₀` is given by the formula:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particles.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime `τ` is not constant. For particles moving at relativistic speeds, their internal clocks slow down relative to a stationary observer (like the detector). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame (`τ_lab`) is related to their proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in their own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\n3.  **Calculate Travel Time:** The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance `L` equal to the radius of the detector to reach the inner walls.\n    `L = 30 meters`\n    The time it takes to travel this distance in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is:\n    `t_lab = L / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. Therefore, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ L / c`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N(t_lab) / N₀`. We can substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula:\n    Fraction surviving, `f = N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    `f = exp(-(L / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `f = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:** The problem gives us two scenarios. The term `L / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `K = L / (c * τ₀)`\n    The survival fraction formula simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n        *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n        *   `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):** We have a system of two equations with two unknowns (`K` and `γ₂`). We can solve this system.\n\n    First, take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `-ln(3) = -K / 20`  => `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `ln(2) - ln(3) = -K / γ₂` => `γ₂ = -K / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** To find the numerical value of `γ₂`, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate gamma_2 using the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\nThe output of this calculation is approximately 54.185.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `γ₂ ≈ 54.185` is very close to option A.\n\n    *   A) 54\n    *   B) 28\n    *   C) 68\n    *   D) 40\n\nTherefore, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** For a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ`, its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n\n2.  **Set up the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The particles travel from the center of the detector to the inner wall, a distance `L` equal to the radius (30 meters).\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time of flight in the laboratory frame (`t_lab`) is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive this journey is `f = N(t_lab) / N₀`.\n    *   Substituting the expressions into the decay formula:\n        `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n        `f = exp(-(L / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Two Given Scenarios:**\n    The term `L / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle type and detector setup.

We can solve for `K` using the first equation and then use that value to solve for `γ₂` in the second equation.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   From Scenario 2:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `K` we found:\n        `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n        Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n        `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        Distribute the negative sign in the denominator:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        Using the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To find the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Model the Particle Decay:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction `f` of particles remaining after a time `t` is given by:\n    `f = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N(t)` is the number at time `t`, and `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Relativistic Effects (Time Dilation):** The lifetime of a moving particle is dilated (extended) from the perspective of a stationary observer (the detector). The lab-frame lifetime `τ_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\n3.  **Determine the Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center and travel to the inner walls of the spherical detector. The distance `L` is the radius, `L = 30 m`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    `t = L / v ≈ L / c`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expressions for `τ_lab` and `t` into the decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-(L / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    We can group the constants `L`, `c`, and `τ₀` into a single constant `A = L / (c * τ₀)`. The formula simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-A / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the Given Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-A / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We want to find `γ₂` for `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-A / γ₂)`\n\n6.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    First, solve for the constant `A` using the information from Scenario 1. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -A / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -A / 20`\n    `A = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, use this value of `A` in the equation for Scenario 2. Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -A / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = -A / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Substitute the expression for `A`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(x/y) = -ln(y/x)`, we can write `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    The previous code execution calculated this exact expression:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)`\n    The output was `54.1902258270291`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** This calculated value is approximately 54. Comparing this result with the given multiple-choice options:\n    *   A) 54\n    *   B) 28\n    *   C) 68\n    *   D) 40\n\n    The closest answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
