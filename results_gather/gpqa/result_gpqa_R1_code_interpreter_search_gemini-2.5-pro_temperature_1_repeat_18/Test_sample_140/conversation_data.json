    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which is a classic example of a reaction proceeding via a benzyne intermediate. This is an elimination-addition reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The bromine atom is the leaving group. The strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), will abstract an acidic proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine.\n\n    ```\n        Br\n       / \\\n    (D)C--C(H)\n     //  \\\\\n   (H)C--C(H)\n       \\ /\n        C\n       (H)\n    ```\n    The positions ortho to the bromine (at C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   Position C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\n2.  **Two Possible Elimination Pathways:** The amide ion can abstract either the hydrogen from C6 or the deuterium from C2.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. This is generally faster than abstracting a deuteron (D⁺) due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker and breaks more easily than the C-D bond). This abstraction is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Although slower, this pathway is still possible. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1. This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is the amide ion (NH₂⁻), will now attack the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n\n1.  **Products from Intermediate 1 (2-deuterobenzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical because of the deuterium at C2. The triple bond is between C1 and C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If the NH₂⁻ attacks C1, the amino group attaches to C1. A carbanion is formed at C6, which is then protonated by ammonia. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If the NH₂⁻ attacks C6, the amino group attaches to C6. A carbanion is formed at C1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the carbon with the -NH₂ group as C1, the deuterium is at the C3 position. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n2.  **Product from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n    *   This intermediate is the standard, symmetrical benzyne with no deuterium. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to symmetry, the attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2 leads to the same product. After protonation, the product is simply **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction produces three distinct organic molecules:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
