As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes**\n\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This is a partial loss of resistance. It means the G1 gene product contributes to resistance, but it's not the only factor. Its loss reduces resistance by 25%.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is a complete loss of resistance. A mutation that completely abolishes a trait often indicates that the gene plays a critical, foundational role in the pathway, such as a master switch.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This is also a partial loss, more severe than g1. Its loss reduces resistance by 50%.\n\nFrom this initial analysis, G2 appears to be the most critical gene, as its absence completely eliminates resistance. This makes it a strong candidate for the transcription factor that regulates the other genes in the pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes to Determine Gene Interactions (Epistasis)**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. In a double mutant, the phenotype will resemble that of the *epistatic* gene (the one that does the masking).\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:**\n    *   g1 phenotype = 75% resistance\n    *   g2 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   g1g2 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant. This means **g2 is epistatic to g1**. This fits the model where G2 is an upstream regulator (like a transcription factor) of G1. If the regulator (G2) is knocked out, the downstream gene (G1) won't be activated anyway, so knocking out G1 as well has no additional effect.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:**\n    *   g2 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   g3 phenotype = 50% resistance\n    *   g2g3 phenotype = 0% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant. This means **g2 is epistatic to g3**. This further strengthens the hypothesis that G2 is an upstream regulator of both G1 and G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:**\n    *   g1 phenotype = 75% resistance\n    *   g3 phenotype = 50% resistance\n    *   g1g3 phenotype = 10% resistance\n    *   The phenotype of the double mutant (10%) is not the same as either single mutant. In fact, it's much more severe than either one. This type of interaction is known as **synergism** or **synthetic enhancement**. It occurs when the two genes function in parallel pathways or have partially overlapping (redundant) functions. The loss of one can be partially compensated for, but the loss of both has a much greater, compounded effect. This tells us G1 and G3 likely act independently of each other, downstream of G2, to contribute to the overall resistance.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n1.  **G2 is a transcription factor:** This is strongly supported by the complete loss-of-function phenotype and the fact that it is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n2.  **G1 and G3 have a synergistic relationship:** The `g1g3` double mutant phenotype shows that they likely have parallel or partially redundant functions. The term **gene redundancy** is a good descriptor for this type of relationship.\n3.  **Pleiotropy** (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment, as only one trait (disease resistance) was measured.\n4.  There is **no classical epistasis** between G1 and G3. The `g1g3` phenotype is not masked by either `g1` or `g3` alone. Therefore, any statement claiming \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" or \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect based on the data.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct.**\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": **Correct.** This is the best description for the observed synergistic effect.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct.**\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": This is a possible molecular mechanism but \"gene redundancy\" is a better description of the functional relationship observed in the experiment.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": **Incorrect.** G2 is the TF candidate.\n    *   \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\": **Cannot be determined.**\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": This part is correct, but the first statement is wrong.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct.**\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": **Cannot be determined.**\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A contains the two most accurate conclusions that can be drawn from the experimental data: G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Although its third clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, it is the best-fit answer because the other options contain more significant errors or unsubstantiated claims in their primary statements. The question likely contains an error in the third clause of the options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
