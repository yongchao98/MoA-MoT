    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is described by the potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The Schrödinger equation for this system can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator equations, one for each Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z).\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the i-th dimension.\n\nFor a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies in the three Cartesian dimensions:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels can then be written as:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nNow we need to find the energy of the third excited state. Let's list the first few energy levels:\n\n1.  **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy state. It corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$, which is $n = 0$. This occurs when $n_x = 0, n_y = 0, n_z = 0$.\n    Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n2.  **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next lowest energy level, which is for $n = 1$.\n    Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n = 2$.\n    Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n4.  **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n = 3$.\n    Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nSo, the value of the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level. This is the degeneracy of the state, which is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum up to $n=3$.\n\nThe degeneracy $g_n$ for the energy level $E_n$ is given by the formula for combinations with repetition:\n$g_n = \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \\binom{n+k-1}{n}$\nIn our case, we are distributing $n=3$ quanta of energy into $k=3$ dimensions.\n$g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\nWe can also list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$:\n*   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n*   One quantum number is 2, another is 1, the third is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1: (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nThus, for the third excited state ($n=3$), the energy is $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$ and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions (i.e., the degeneracy is 10).\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\nOur calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
