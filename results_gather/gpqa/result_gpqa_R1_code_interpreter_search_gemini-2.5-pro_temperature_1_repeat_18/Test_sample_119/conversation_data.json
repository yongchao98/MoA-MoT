    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. For small angles, the relationship is `plx ≈ 1/d`. Therefore, the distance to a star can be expressed as `d ≈ 1/plx`.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find how \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax. This is essentially asking for the distribution function of stars with respect to parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space around the Earth. Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`, where `dd` is a very small thickness.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = (4πd²) * dd`.\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with a density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Convert from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we need to express this relationship in terms of parallax (`plx`) instead of distance (`d`). We use the relation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the corresponding small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign. So, `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²)`\n    *   Let's combine the terms:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
