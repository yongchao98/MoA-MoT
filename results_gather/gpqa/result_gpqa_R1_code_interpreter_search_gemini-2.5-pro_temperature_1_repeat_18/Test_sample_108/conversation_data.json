    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the forbidden reaction.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\nThe initial system is two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. Let's decode this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   `2S+1 = 1` implies the total spin of the two nucleons is `S_i = 0`.\n*   The letter `S` (spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum) means `L_i = 0`.\n*   The subscript `0` means the total angular momentum of the initial system is `J_i = 0`.\n\nThe initial parity `P_i` is determined by the orbital angular momentum: `P_i = P_N * P_N * (-1)^L_i`. Since nucleons have intrinsic parity `P_N = +1`, this gives `P_i = (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Understand the Final State and Conservation Laws\nThe system decays into a final two-nucleon state (`NN_f`) and a particle `X`.\n`1S0 -> NN_f + X`\n\nWe must apply three main rules as specified in the problem:\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the final NN state**: The problem gives the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. It also specifies that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN_f) = 0`. Substituting this in, we get:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This is equivalent to stating that `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** number for the reaction to be allowed.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Parity**: The total parity must be conserved, so `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l`, where `l` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the final NN system.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   The problem states particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l = -(-1)^(L_f + l)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved (`P_i = P_f`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l)`.\n    *   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l) = -1`, which means `L_f + l` must be an **odd** number.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J_i = J_f`.\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum `J(NN_f)` and particle X's total angular momentum `J(X)`.\n    *   The term symbol for `NN_f` gives us `J(NN_f)`.\n    *   The lowercase letter (`s, p, d, f`) gives us the orbital angular momentum `l` of particle X. Assuming particle X is spinless (which is standard unless specified otherwise), its total angular momentum is `J(X) = l`.\n    *   So, `J_f` results from coupling `J(NN_f)` and `l`. For `J_f` to be `0`, it must be possible to obtain `0` from the vector addition, which requires `J(NN_f)` and `l` to be in a coupling that includes `0`. This is possible if `|J(NN_f) - l| <= 0 <= J(NN_f) + l`, which is always true if `J(NN_f) = l`. More generally, we just need `0` to be a possible outcome of the vector sum.\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Option\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions. A reaction is forbidden if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f`: `3S1` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J(NN_f)=1`.\n*   `X`: `p`-wave -> `l=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 0 + 1 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=1`, `l=1`. Vector sum `|1-1|...|1+1|` is `0, 1, 2`. Since `J_f=0` is possible, this is **OK**.\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f`: `3P0` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J(NN_f)=0`.\n*   `X`: `s`-wave -> `l=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (Even). -> **VIOLATION**. The sum must be odd.\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 1 + 0 = 1` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=0`, `l=0`. Vector sum `|0-0|...|0+0|` is `0`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle condition for a `T=0` final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f`: `3D3` -> `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J(NN_f)=3`.\n*   `X`: `f`-wave -> `l=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 1 + 2 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 2 + 3 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=3`, `l=3`. Vector sum `|3-3|...|3+3|` is `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: This reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f`: `7D1` -> `2S+1=7` so `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J(NN_f)=1`.\n*   `X`: `p`-wave -> `l=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have total spin S=0 or S=1. Thus, `S=3` is physically impossible. However, the question asks us to check the given rules. Let's strictly apply the rules from the prompt.\n1.  **Pauli Check**: `S_f + L_f = 3 + 2 = 5` (Odd). -> **OK**\n2.  **Parity Check**: `L_f + l = 2 + 1 = 3` (Odd). -> **OK**\n3.  **J Cons. Check**: `J(NN_f)=1`, `l=1`. Vector sum `|1-1|...|1+1|` is `0, 1, 2`. `J_f=0` is possible. -> **OK**\n*   Conclusion: According to the specific rules given in the problem, this reaction is permitted. The reason it's truly impossible is that the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons, a fact that is outside the explicit checklist provided in the question's text.\n\n### Final Decision\nComparing the options, only reaction B violates one of the explicit conditions given in the problem statement (the Pauli statistics rule for T=0). Therefore, it is the one that is \"not permitted\" based on the problem's constraints.\n\n<<<B>>>"
