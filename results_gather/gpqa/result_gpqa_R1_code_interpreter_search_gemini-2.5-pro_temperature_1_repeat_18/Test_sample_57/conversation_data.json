    "The user is asking to identify which of the listed physical theories is free from high-energy (ultraviolet) divergences and therefore does not need a procedure called regularization.\n\n1.  **Analyze Classical Electrodynamics (A):**\n    *   This theory describes the behavior of electric and magnetic fields as laid out by Maxwell's equations.\n    *   A significant problem arises when considering a fundamental particle like an electron as a point charge. The energy stored in the electric field of a point charge (its self-energy) is calculated by integrating the energy density of the field over all space. This integral diverges as the distance from the charge approaches zero.\n    *   To get a finite answer, one must introduce a \"cutoff,\" essentially assuming the charge is not a true point but is smeared over a tiny, non-zero radius. This cutoff procedure is a form of regularization.\n    *   Therefore, Classical Electrodynamics does face high-energy/short-distance problems that require regularization.\n\n2.  **Analyze Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) (B) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) (D):**\n    *   Both QED and QCD are Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). QED describes the interaction of light and matter (photons and electrons), while QCD describes the strong nuclear force (quarks and gluons).\n    *   A hallmark of perturbative calculations in QFTs is the appearance of divergent integrals when calculating physical quantities like scattering amplitudes or particle self-energies. These divergences come from \"loop diagrams,\" which represent the contributions of virtual particles at arbitrarily high energies (or, equivalently, arbitrarily short distances).\n    *   The standard procedure to handle these infinities is a two-step process:\n        1.  **Regularization:** The divergent integral is made mathematically finite by introducing a parameter, such as a momentum cutoff (Î›) or by changing the dimensionality of spacetime (dimensional regularization). This makes the math tractable.\n        2.  **Renormalization:** The physical parameters of the theory (like mass and charge) are redefined to absorb the divergent parts (which depend on the regularization parameter). As the cutoff is taken to infinity (or the dimension is returned to 4), the calculated physical observables remain finite and well-defined.\n    *   Since both QED and QCD are QFTs that rely on this process to make predictions, they fundamentally require regularization at high energies.\n\n3.  **Analyze Superstring Theory (C):**\n    *   Superstring theory is a candidate for a unified theory of everything, including quantum gravity.\n    *   One of its primary motivations and most celebrated features is that it is believed to be free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences.\n    *   Unlike in QFTs, where fundamental entities are point-like particles, in string theory, they are one-dimensional, vibrating strings. The interactions between these strings are not point-like events but are \"smeared out\" over a region of spacetime.\n    *   This smearing effect naturally smooths out the short-distance behavior that causes divergences in QFTs. Calculations of scattering amplitudes in string theory are found to be finite without the need for an ad-hoc regularization and renormalization procedure to handle high-energy infinities. It is said to be \"UV-complete.\"\n    *   Therefore, Superstring Theory is the theory on this list that is conjectured to not require regularization at high energies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nClassical Electrodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics all encounter infinities when dealing with high-energy (or short-distance) phenomena, necessitating some form of regularization. Superstring Theory, by its very construction with extended objects (strings) instead of point particles, is believed to be naturally free from these divergences.\n\n<<<C>>>"
