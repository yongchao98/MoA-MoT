    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃CH₂(C=O)CH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₃.\n    *   There is one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) can occur from two different faces (re or si face).\n    *   This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   Since the starting molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The attack of the hydride is not equally probable from both sides, leading to the formation of two diastereomers in unequal amounts.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed. They are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃(C=O)CH₂(C=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   New chiral centers are created at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group. Therefore, it is an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers, but it can separate diastereomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   Products 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Products 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and will co-elute, appearing as **one peak**.\n    *   Product 5 is a diastereomer of products 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving **one peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (methoxy alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are constitutionally different molecules. They have different structures, molecular weights, and polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the separable groups: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair in Reaction II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all different stereoisomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   A chiral column will separate all five of these stereoisomers because they all have unique three-dimensional shapes that will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Diastereomers (1 and 2) will be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers (3 and 4) will be separated.\n    *   The meso compound (5) is a diastereomer of 3 and 4 and will be separated from them. It will appear as its own peak.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since there are 5 distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**, assuming the column provides sufficient resolution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
