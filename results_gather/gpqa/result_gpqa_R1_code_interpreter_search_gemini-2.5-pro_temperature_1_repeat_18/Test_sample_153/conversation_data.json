    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotope of each element.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic indicator of the presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl exist in a roughly 3:1 natural abundance).\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is diagnostic for a carboxylic acid proton. Its integration of 1H confirms one such proton, and its multiplicity as a singlet (s) is also typical.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a 1,4-disubstituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side also equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals, each representing two protons.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure has the correct molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and functional groups. However, a 1,2-(ortho) substitution pattern would result in a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, likely with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, not two doublets of 2H each.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule contains an aldehyde and an alcohol, not a carboxylic acid. This is inconsistent with the IR (very broad O-H) and the ¹H NMR (no aldehyde proton ~9-10 ppm, but a carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm).\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule is an acid chloride/ester hybrid. It lacks the acidic proton and would not show the broad O-H stretch in the IR. Its carbonyl stretch would also be at a much higher frequency (~1780 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure perfectly matches all the data.\n        *   **MS:** Molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂, giving a molecular weight of ~156 g/mol for the ³⁵Cl isotope and a clear M+2 peak for the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the broad O-H stretch and the conjugated C=O stretch.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring, which explains the symmetrical pattern of two doublets for the aromatic protons. It also has the carboxylic acid proton responsible for the singlet at 11.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group deshields the adjacent protons more than the chlorine, hence the two distinct doublets.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
