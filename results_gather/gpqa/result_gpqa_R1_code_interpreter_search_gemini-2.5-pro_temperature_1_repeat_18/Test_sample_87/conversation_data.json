    "The user is describing an experiment that traces an immune response to a viral protein delivered orally. Let's break down the key steps and observations to determine the underlying biological process.\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Location:** Rotavirus proteins (antigens) are delivered orally. The immune response is observed in the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), which are secondary lymphoid organs responsible for initiating immune responses against antigens encountered in the intestines. This is the correct location for an immune response to an oral antigen.\n\n2.  **Cell Population:** The cells isolated are described as \"proliferating.\" This indicates clonal expansion, a hallmark of an adaptive immune response where lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are stimulated to divide rapidly. This proliferation occurs in specialized structures within secondary lymphoid organs called germinal centers.\n\n3.  **Genetic Analysis:** The variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells is sequenced. The key finding is \"high variability.\" This means that among the population of proliferating cells, the DNA sequences of their variable heavy chain genes are not identical but show many differences, likely point mutations.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of these findings:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). It does *not* alter the *variable* region. Therefore, it cannot account for the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene. While class switching is likely happening in these cells, it is not the process described by the observation.\n\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes of activated B cells. It occurs in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) during a proliferative response to an antigen. The goal of SHM is to create antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen. This process perfectly explains the finding of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a Peyer's patch.\n\n*   **C) VDJ recombination:** This is the process of gene segment rearrangement that creates the initial, diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. Critically, this process occurs in the *bone marrow* (a primary lymphoid organ) during the initial development of B cells, *before* they encounter any antigen. The cells in the experiment are mature lymphocytes responding to an antigen in a *secondary* lymphoid organ. VDJ recombination has already been completed in these cells.\n\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve any genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating lymphocytes in a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the definitive signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
