    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup and results.**\n    The experiment involves the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes to identify their components.\n\n    *   **Initial state:** An equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Total mass = 7.20 g. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\n        `n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20 g` where M_A and M_B are the molar masses.\n\n    *   **Decomposition:** The salts are heated and decompose completely into a mixture of gases. `Salts(s) -> Gases(g)`. This suggests the salts might be ammonium salts, which often decompose without leaving a solid residue.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.\n        *   The weight of the tube did not change. This indicates that no CO₂ (or other acidic gases like SO₂) was produced in the decomposition. This rules out salts like carbonates or sulfates that would produce these gases.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, most commonly oxygen (O₂).\n        *   Weight increase = 0.80 g. The problem states CuO is formed. The increase in mass is due to the oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of oxygen gas produced are: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for such an inert gas, formed from salts containing nitrogen, is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the elements and deduce the salts.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts A and B must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Since they are salts that decompose into only gases, ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen are the most probable candidates. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n3.  **Propose decomposition reactions and test the hypothesis.**\n    Let's assume Salt A is ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Salt B is ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). Let 'n' be the number of moles of each.\n\n    *   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (A):**\n        `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        For `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, this produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n    *   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (B):**\n        The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can be complex. We need a reaction that produces O₂. The explosive decomposition is `2NH₄NO₃(s) -> 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`. Let's use the stoichiometry for `n` moles of NH₄NO₃:\n        `n NH₄NO₃(s) -> n N₂(g) + (n/2) O₂(g) + 2n H₂O(g)`\n        This reaction is balanced and produces the required products.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total moles of products and compare with experimental data.**\n    From the equimolar mixture of `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B:\n    *   **Total H₂O:** `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n` moles.\n    *   **Total O₂:** `0` (from A) + `n/2` (from B) = `n/2` moles.\n    *   **Total N₂:** `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n` moles.\n\n    Now, let's use the experimental results to find `n`:\n    *   From H₂O: `4n = 0.2 mol` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   From O₂: `n/2 = 0.025 mol` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   From N₂: `2n = 0.1 mol` => `n = 0.05 mol`.\n\n    All three calculations yield the same value `n = 0.05 mol`. This confirms our hypothesis is consistent.\n\n5.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   Salt A: NH₄NO₂ (Molar Mass = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*2 = 64 g/mol)\n    *   Salt B: NH₄NO₃ (Molar Mass = 14*2 + 1*4 + 16*3 = 80 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = `n * M_A + n * M_B` = `n * (M_A + M_B)`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 mol * (64 g/mol + 80 g/mol)`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 * 144` = 7.20 g.\n    This matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification of the salts is correct.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms:** 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H = 1.008\nM_O = 15.999\nM_N = 14.007\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O = 0.80  # g\nvol_N2_STP = 2.24  # L\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / (2 * M_H + M_O)\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O / M_O\nmoles_O2 = moles_O_atoms / 2\nmoles_N2 = vol_N2_STP / 22.4\n\n# From stoichiometry:\n# 4n = moles_H2O\n# n/2 = moles_O2\n# 2n = moles_N2\n# We can solve for n from any of these.

As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each tube and identify the products.**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong desiccant (drying agent). Its purpose is to absorb water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to test for acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is `2Cu(s) + O₂(g) -> 2CuO(s)`. The increase in the mass of the tube is due to the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of oxygen gas produced are half the moles of oxygen atoms: Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains. This measurement is at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. The products contain H, O, and N (from the salts). The most likely candidate for this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Summarize the decomposition products.**\n    The decomposition of salts A and B produces:\n    *   0.2 mol of H₂O\n    *   0.025 mol of O₂\n    *   0.1 mol of N₂\n\n3.  **Deduce the composition of salts A and B.**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) show that the original salts must contain the elements Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   The fact that they are salts and decompose completely into gases strongly suggests they are ammonium salts containing an oxygen-and-nitrogen-based anion.\n    *   Let's hypothesize the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n4.  **Write the balanced decomposition equations and check stoichiometry.**\n    Let's assume the mixture contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B (equimolar mixture).\n\n    *   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can produce different products depending on the temperature. A common reaction that produces O₂ is: `2NH₄NO₃(s) -> 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`. Let's use this stoichiometry.\n        *   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\n5.  **Relate the stoichiometry to the experimental results to find 'n'.**\n    *   **Total Moles of H₂O:** `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`.\n        *   `4n = 0.2` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   **Total Moles of O₂:** `0` (from A) + `n/2` (from B) = `n/2`.\n        *   `n/2 = 0.025` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n    *   **Total Moles of N₂:** `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`.\n        *   `2n = 0.1` mol => `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n    All calculations consistently give `n = 0.05` mol. This confirms our identification of the salts and their decomposition reactions is correct.\n\n6.  **Verify the initial mass.**\n    *   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂): (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃): (2 × 14.01) + (4 × 1.01) + (3 × 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass of the mixture = `n * M_A + n * M_B`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 mol * (64.06 g/mol + 80.06 g/mol)`\n    *   Total mass = `0.05 * 144.12` = 7.206 g.\n    This is in excellent agreement with the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms =** 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
