    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Extract Given Information\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest mass: `M`\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   It fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment.\n*   `m1 = 2 * m2`\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T1`.\n*   The goal is to find the difference between the correct relativistic `T1` and the classical approximation of `T1`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments and the Q-value\n\nFirst, we determine the rest masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n2.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy (`T_total`) of the fragments.\n`Q = T_total = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest Energy) - (Final Rest Energy)`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n*   `p1 = p`\n*   `p2 = p`\n\nSo, we can write the kinetic energies as:\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`  =>  `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n`3 * T1_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is the sum of kinetic energy and rest-mass energy, `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nAs before, conservation of momentum implies `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\nWe can express `(p*c)^2` for each fragment:\n*   For fragment 1: `(p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2`\n*   For fragment 2: `(p*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nExpanding `(a+b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab`, we get:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nEquating the two expressions for `(p*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute `T2 = Q - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*(m2*c^2)`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2) - 2*T1*(m2*c^2)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel. Rearrange to solve for `T1`:\n`2*T1*(m1*c^2) + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*(m2*c^2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2)`\n`T1 * [2*(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + 2*Q] = Q^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2)`\n`T1 * [2 * (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q)] = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nRecall that `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q = M*c^2`.\n`T1 * (2 * M*c^2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n`T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * M*c^2)`\n\nNow, plug in the energy values in GeV:\n*   `Q = 3`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99`\n*   `M*c^2 = 300`\n\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * (3 + 2 * 99)) / (2 * 300)`\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * (3 + 198)) / 600`\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * 201) / 600 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference is `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`.\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Given values\nM_c2 = 300.0  # Rest mass energy of the initial nucleus\n\n# Calculate rest mass energies of the fragments\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M and m1 = 2 * m2 => m2 = 0.33 * M, m1 = 0.66 * M\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\n\n# Q-value (total kinetic energy) is the mass defect converted to energy\nQ = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Classical calculation for T1\n# From conservation of momentum, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2.\n# With T1 + T2 = Q, we get 3*T1 = Q.\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2_c2)) / (2 * M_c2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2_c2)) / (2 * M_c2)\n\n# Difference in MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV} MeV.\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",

Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n*   `p1 = p`\n*   `p2 = p`\n\nSo, we can write the kinetic energies as:\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2`  =>  `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is the Q-value:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = Q`\n`3 * T1_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is the sum of kinetic energy and rest-mass energy, `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nAs before, conservation of momentum implies `|p1| = |p2| = p`. We can express `(p*c)^2` for each fragment:\n*   For fragment 1: `(p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2`\n*   For fragment 2: `(p*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nExpanding the terms `(a+b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab`, we get:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nEquating the two expressions for `(p*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nSubstitute `T2 = Q - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*(m2*c^2)`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2) - 2*T1*(m2*c^2)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out. We can rearrange the equation to solve for `T1`:\n`2*T1*(m1*c^2) + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*(m2*c^2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2)`\n`T1 * [2*(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) + 2*Q] = Q^2 + 2*Q*(m2*c^2)`\n`T1 * [2 * (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q)] = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n\nRecall that `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q = (Final Rest Energy) + (Total Kinetic Energy) = (Initial Total Energy)`. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, its initial total energy is just its rest energy, `M*c^2`.\n`T1 * (2 * M*c^2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n`T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * M*c^2)`\n\nNow, we plug in the energy values we calculated earlier (all in GeV):\n*   `Q = 3`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99`\n*   `M*c^2 = 300`\n\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * (3 + 2 * 99)) / (2 * 300)`\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * (3 + 198)) / 600`\n`T1_relativistic = (3 * 201) / 600 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe final step is to calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for `T1`.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy `T1` and its classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
