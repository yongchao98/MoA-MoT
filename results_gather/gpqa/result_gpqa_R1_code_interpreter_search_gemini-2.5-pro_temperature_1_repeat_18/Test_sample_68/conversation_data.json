    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution of a detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. In the context of particle detectors, \"observing\" a decay means being able to resolve the decay vertex from the production vertex. This requires the particle to travel a minimum distance, let's call it $d_{res}$, before it decays. Therefore, we need to find the distance $d_{res}$ such that 30% of the particles travel at least this distance before decaying.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. For a collection of $N_0$ particles moving with a velocity $v$, the number of particles that survive after traveling a distance $d$ is given by:\n    $N(d) = N_0 e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Condition:** We want the fraction of particles that are \"observed\" to be at least 30%. An observed particle is one that travels a distance $d \\ge d_{res}$. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $d_{res}$ is $N(d_{res})/N_0$.\n    So, the condition is:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the *minimum* resolution, we use the equality:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Resolution:** We can solve the equation for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The mean decay length depends on the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its velocity ($v$), and relativistic effects.\n    First, we need the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, which is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0 c^2$).\n    $E = 27$ GeV\n    $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n    The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is dilated: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    The mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n    A more direct way to calculate $\\lambda$ is using the particle's momentum ($p$):\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    We can find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$.\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0 c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2$\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:** Now we plug in the numbers to find the final answer. We will use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants\nE = 27  # Energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate pc (momentum * c) in GeV\npc_squared = E**2 - m0c2**2\npc = np.sqrt(pc_squared)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in meters\n# lambda = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\nmean_decay_length = (pc / m0c2) * c * tau0\n\n# Calculate the minimum resolution distance (d_res)\n# We want the fraction of decays observed (d > d_res) to be 0.3.\n# The probability of surviving to distance d_res is P(d > d_res) = exp(-d_res / lambda)\n# So, exp(-d_res / lambda) = 0.3\n# d_res = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nd_res = -mean_decay_length * np.log(0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{d_res:.2e}\")\n```\n2.27e-06\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculation gives a minimum resolution of approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.

    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\nThe problem involves the decay of a relativistic particle. Here are the key concepts we'll use:\n*   **Radioactive Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles remaining after a certain time or, equivalently, after traveling a certain distance, can be calculated using this law.\n*   **Special Relativity:** Since the particle is moving at a high speed (its energy of 27 GeV is much larger than its rest mass energy of 3.41 GeV), we must account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation. The particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame will be longer than its proper lifetime.\n\n### 2. Formulating the Condition\n\n*   We want to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays. In a detector like a bubble chamber, observing a decay means being able to distinguish the decay point from the production point. This requires the particle to travel a minimum distance, which we can call the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$.\n*   The number of particles $N(d)$ that survive after traveling a distance $d$ in the lab frame is given by:\n    $N(d) = N_0 e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   The fraction of particles that are \"observed\" is the fraction that travels a distance *at least* $d_{res}$. This is the same as the fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance $d_{res}$.\n*   So, we set the condition:\n    $\\frac{N(d_{res})}{N_0} = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   Solving for the resolution distance $d_{res}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nThe mean decay length $\\lambda$ depends on the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) and its velocity ($v$).\n*   $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n*   Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy ($E$) to the rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$):\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n*   The velocity is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n*   Putting it all together, $\\lambda = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n*   A more direct way to calculate the term $\\gamma\\beta$ is using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. We also know that momentum $p = \\gamma m_0 v = \\gamma m_0 (\\beta c)$, so $pc = \\gamma\\beta (m_0c^2)$.\n*   From this, we get $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2}$.\n*   So, the full expression for the mean decay length is:\n    $\\lambda = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}}{m_0c^2} \\right) c \\tau_0$\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we can plug in the given values to find the final answer. We'll use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s (The script will use a more precise value).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given constants from the problem\nE_GeV = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2_GeV = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0_s = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc_ms = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate pc (momentum * c) in GeV using the relativistic energy-momentum relation\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0c^2)^2\npc_GeV = np.sqrt(E_GeV**2 - m0c2_GeV**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in meters\n# lambda = (pc / m0) * tau0 = (pc * c / (m0 * c^2)) * tau0\n# In our units: lambda = (pc_GeV / m0c2_GeV) * c_ms * tau0_s\nmean_decay_length_m = (pc_GeV / m0c2_GeV) * c_ms * tau0_s\n\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays. This means the particle must travel\n# a distance d >= d_res. The probability for this is P(d >= d_res) = exp(-d_res / lambda).\n# We set this probability to 0.3.\n# exp(-d_res / lambda) = 0.3\n# Taking the natural log: -d_res / lambda = ln(0.3)\n# d_res = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nmin_resolution_m = -mean_decay_length_m * np.log(0.3)\n\nprint(f\"{min_resolution_m:.2e}\")\n```\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe code executes the calculation based on the derived formula and outputs `2.27e-06`. This means the required minimum resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close in order of magnitude and value to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The small difference (about 9%) is likely due to slight variations in the constants used or rounding in the problem's original design. Given the choices, option C is the only one that is physically plausible and numerically close to the calculated answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Understanding the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. In the context of a particle detector, \"observing a decay\" means that the particle travels a distance greater than or equal to the detector's minimum resolvable distance ($d_{res}$) before it decays.
