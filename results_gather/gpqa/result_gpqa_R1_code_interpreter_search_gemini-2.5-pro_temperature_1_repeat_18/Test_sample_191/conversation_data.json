    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with a spherical conductor that is electrically neutral (uncharged). It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge `+q`:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction of charges:** According to the principles of electrostatics, this charge `+q` will induce charges on the surfaces of the conductor.\n    *   **Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):** The electric field lines from the charge `+q` will terminate on the inner surface of the cavity. To cancel the electric field within the bulk of the conductor (a defining property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of `-q` must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law applied to a surface within the conducting material enclosing the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has been drawn to the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Distribution of the induced charges:**\n    *   The charge `+q` is placed at an arbitrary point *inside* the cavity, not necessarily at its center. This means the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface will **not** be distributed uniformly. It will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to `+q`.\n    *   However, the charge `+q` on the **outer surface** is a different story. The conductor's bulk acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges on the outer surface are shielded from the specific arrangement of charges inside the cavity. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over this outer surface to minimize repulsion, regardless of the cavity's position or the charge's position within it.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P (Outside):** The total electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n6.  **The Shielding Effect:** A fundamental theorem of electrostatics states that for any point outside a closed conducting shell, the electric field due to the charges *inside* the shell and the charges induced on the *inner surface* of the shell is exactly zero. In our case, the field at P due to the `+q` in the cavity and the `-q` on the cavity wall cancels out completely.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at the external point P is due **only** to the charge `+q` distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   We have a total charge of `+q` distributed uniformly on a spherical surface of radius `R`.\n    *   According to another key result from Gauss's law (often called the Shell Theorem), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The distance of point P from the center O is `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The information regarding the cavity's radius (`r`), the position of its center (`s`), the distance from the cavity's center to P (`l`), and the angle `theta` are all extraneous details designed to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, ignores the conductor)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\n\n<<<D>>>"
