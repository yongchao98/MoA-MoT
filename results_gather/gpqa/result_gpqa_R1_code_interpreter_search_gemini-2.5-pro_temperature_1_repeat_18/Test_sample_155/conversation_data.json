    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation.** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It reacts with mCPBA in an epoxidation reaction. This reaction is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is symmetric and achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from either the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top face produces the (4R,5R)-epoxide.\n    *   Attack from the bottom face produces the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Therefore, the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H3O+). This opens the epoxide ring to form a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the protonated epoxide, which occurs from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen. This is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Let's consider the (4R,5R)-epoxide. The incoming water molecule will attack from the \"back side\". Attack at C4 leads to the (4R,5S)-diol. Attack at C5 also leads to the (4R,5S)-diol. This product has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's consider the (4S,5S)-epoxide. An anti-attack by water at either C4 or C5 will also lead to the same (4R,5S)-meso-diol.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Mnemonic:** The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation. A common mnemonic for this is: *trans*-alkene + *anti*-addition → *meso* product. This confirms our result.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation.** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom from mCPBA across the *cis*-double bond creates a *meso* epoxide, (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The meso-epoxide is then opened by aqueous acid via an *anti*-attack mechanism.\n    *   Attack of water at C4 of the protonated meso-epoxide will produce the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Attack of water at C5 will produce the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio. This is a *racemic mixture*.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Mnemonic:** The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation. The mnemonic is: *cis*-alkene + *anti*-addition → *racemic* product. This also confirms our result.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The meso-diol will have a different polarity than the enantiomeric pair and will thus have a different retention time, eluting as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion: The standard HPLC will show 2 peaks.** (Peak 1: meso-diol; Peak 2: racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomers (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso-diol from the other two, as it is a diastereomer.\n    *   **Conclusion: The chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.** (One for each of the three stereoisomers present in the mixture).\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
