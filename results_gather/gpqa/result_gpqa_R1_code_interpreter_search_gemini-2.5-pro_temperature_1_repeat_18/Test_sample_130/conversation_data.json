    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that dehydrates to an anhydride.\n        *   **1H NMR of Anhydride:** A single peak at 7 ppm. This chemical shift is in the vinylic/aromatic region. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n        *   **13C NMR of Anhydride:** Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). The presence of only two peaks also indicates high molecular symmetry.\n        *   The only common structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**, formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent vinylic protons (giving a singlet at ~7.0 ppm) and two sets of equivalent carbons (two vinylic carbons and two carbonyl carbons), consistent with the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The second reactant is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a conjugated diene substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the diene is C9H14, and the anhydride is C4H2O3. The adduct's formula is C13H16O3, which matches the problem statement.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed, which correspond to these two isomers.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry):**\n    *   The *endo* rule states that the kinetically favored (usually major) product is the one where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented under the newly forming ring (syn to the longer bridge).\n    *   **However, this rule is often reversed by significant steric hindrance.** In this case, the diene has methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). In the *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride moiety would clash sterically with these methyl groups.\n    *   In the *exo* approach, the anhydride is oriented away from these methyl groups, resulting in a much less sterically hindered transition state.\n    *   Therefore, due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **major product will be the *exo* isomer**, and the **minor product will be the *endo* isomer**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Predicted NMR Signals:**\n    *   Let's visualize the two products and identify the key proton groups. Both products are highly symmetrical.\n        *   **H-anhydride:** The two protons on the anhydride part of the skeleton (at positions C2 and C3). They are equivalent due to symmetry in both isomers. They are alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring, so a chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable. This would be a **2H singlet**.\n        *   **Me-alkene:** The two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (at C5 and C6). They are equivalent. As vinylic methyl groups, their shift would be around **~1.7 ppm**. This would be a **6H singlet**.\n        *   **Me-bridgehead:** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (at C1 and C4). They are also equivalent. Being on a saturated, quaternary carbon, they would be more shielded, with a shift likely around **~1.0 ppm**. This would be another **6H singlet**.\n        *   (Note: The protons on the C7 bridge are not relevant to the options provided).\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NOESY Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Ã…). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons.\n    *   The problem states: A cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n    *   Since we determined that **Major = *exo*** and **Minor = *endo***, we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* isomer but far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n\n    *   Let's examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   ***Exo* isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C5=C6 double bond. This brings the **H-anhydride protons** (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **Me-alkene groups** (~1.7 ppm). **A strong NOE cross-peak is expected.**\n        *   ***Endo* isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C5=C6 double bond (it is *syn* to the C7 bridge). The H-anhydride protons and the Me-alkene groups are far apart. **No significant NOE is expected.**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The observed NOE cross-peak, which is present only in the major product, must connect the H-anhydride protons and the Me-alkene protons.\n    *   Based on our signal assignments, these correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
