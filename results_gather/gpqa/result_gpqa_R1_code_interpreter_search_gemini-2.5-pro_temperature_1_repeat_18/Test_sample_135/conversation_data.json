    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Volume:**\n    *   The vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as the vector `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume of integration is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:**\n    *   The goal is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f`. This is represented as `∫_V (∇.f) dV`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method:**\n    *   We could try to calculate the divergence `∇.f` directly and then integrate over the volume. However, the field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), which is inside our volume of integration. Direct calculation of the divergence at `r=0` is problematic.\n    *   A more elegant and robust method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that bounds the volume.\n    *   The Divergence Theorem states: `∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`, where `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   In our case, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere (a spherical shell at `r=R`).\n    *   We need to calculate the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n5.  **Define the Terms for the Surface Integral:**\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface `S`, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential area element `dS` is a vector that points radially outward (in the direction of `r̂`). Its magnitude is `R^2 * sinθ dθ dφ`. Therefore, `dS = (R^2 * sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Dot Product (f . dS):**\n    *   `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] . [(R^2 * sinθ dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n    *   Since the dot product of a unit vector with itself is 1 (`r̂ . r̂ = 1`), the expression simplifies:\n    *   `f . dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * (sinθ dθ dφ) * (r̂ . r̂)`\n    *   `f . dS = 1 * sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ`\n    *   Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out, which means the result will be independent of the radius `R` of the sphere.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   Now we integrate `f . dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for a full sphere in spherical coordinates are `φ` from `0` to `2π` and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n    *   `∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π (sinθ dθ dφ)`\n    *   We can separate the integrals:\n    *   `∫_φ=0^(2π) dφ * ∫_θ=0^π sinθ dθ`\n    *   The first integral is: `∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`.\n    *   The second integral is: `∫_0^π sinθ dθ = [-cosθ]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Multiplying the results: `(2π) * (2) = 4π`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    *   `∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`.\n    *   This result corresponds to option A.\n\nAlternative Consideration (Physics Analogy):\nThis problem is mathematically identical to using Gauss's Law in electrostatics to find the flux from a point charge. The field `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` has the same form as the electric field from a point charge at the origin (up to a constant). The integral `∫_V (∇.f) dV` represents the total \"source strength\" within the volume. The Divergence Theorem shows this is equal to the total flux `∮_S (f . dS)` leaving the volume. Since the source is at the origin, any sphere centered at the origin will enclose this source, and the calculated flux `4π` represents this total source strength.\n\n<<<A>>>"
