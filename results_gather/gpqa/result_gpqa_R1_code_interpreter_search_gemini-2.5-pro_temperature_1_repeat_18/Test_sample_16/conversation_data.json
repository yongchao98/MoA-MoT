    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves the equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, dissociates into its constituent ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The reaction for dissociation is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate the formation constant (K_f) to the dissociation constant (K_d):** The problem gives the formation constant, $K_{Ca-EDTA}$ (also known as $K_f$), which corresponds to the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    To analyze the dissociation, we need the dissociation constant, $K_d$, which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    The expression for $K_d$ is:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_d expression:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large and the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small, we can assume that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows us to simplify the denominator:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    Now the equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n    Solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Solve for x:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\n    To make the calculation easier, we can write $4 \\times 10^{-13}$ as $40 \\times 10^{-14}$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\n6.  **Final Answer:** The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    This matches option C.\n\nI will use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\n\n# Calculate the dissociation constant\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# We need to solve the equation: K_d = x^2 / (initial_conc - x)\n# Since K_d is very small, we can approximate initial_conc - x as initial_conc.\n# K_d = x^2 / initial_conc\n# x^2 = K_d * initial_conc\n# x = sqrt(K_d * initial_conc)\n\nx_squared = K_d * initial_complex_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The value of x is the concentration of Ca2+ ions\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution of Ca-EDTA.\n\n**1. Understand the equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. The equilibrium reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n*   **Formation reaction:** $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n*   The formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) is given as $5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n*   **Dissociation reaction:** $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n*   The equilibrium constant for dissociation ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE table**\n\nWe start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n**3. Substitute into the K_d expression**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**4. Solve for x**\n\nBecause $K_d$ is very small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$), the extent of dissociation 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nNow, solve for $x^2$:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x = (\\sqrt{40}) \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**5. Compare with the given options**\nA) 5.0x10^-3 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 6.3x10^-7 M\nD) 1.0x10^-2 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C. The previous python code execution confirmed this result (`6.32e-07`).\n\n<<<C>>>"
