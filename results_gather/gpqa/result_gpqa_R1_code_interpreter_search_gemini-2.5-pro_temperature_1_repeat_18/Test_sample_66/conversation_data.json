    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons. We are considering their orbital angular momentum.\n    Each electron is in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum squared operator, $L^2$, with quantum number $l=2$.\n    It is also an eigenstate of the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the measurement and the desired outcome.**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    The possible outcomes for a measurement of $L_{iz}$ (where i=1 or 2) are $m_i\\hbar$, where $m_i$ can be $-l_i, ..., +l_i$. Since $l_1=l_2=1$, the possible values for $m_1$ and $m_2$ are $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    The measurement collapses the system's state into an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, which is represented by the uncoupled state ket $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$, or simply $|m_1, m_2>$ for short (since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1).\n\n    The question asks for the joint probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means we measure $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which means we measure $m_2 = -1$.\n    This desired final state is the uncoupled state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics to find the probability.**\n    The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state vector onto the final state vector corresponding to that outcome.\n    *   Initial state: $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |l=2, m=-1>$\n    *   Final state (for the desired outcome): $|\\Psi_{final}> = |m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$\n    *   Probability: $P = | <\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}> |^2 = | <m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1> |^2$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the inner product using conservation laws.**\n    A crucial concept here is the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. The operator for the total z-component is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    The final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Its eigenvalue is:\n    $L_z |m_1=-1, m_2=-1> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |m_1=-1, m_2=-1> = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar) |m_1=-1, m_2=-1> = (-1\\hbar -1\\hbar) |m_1=-1, m_2=-1> = -2\\hbar |m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$.\n    So, the final state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m' = m_1 + m_2 = -2$.\n\n    The initial state has $m=-1$ and the final state has $m'=-2$. Since these states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) but with different eigenvalues, they must be orthogonal.\n    Therefore, their inner product is zero:\n    $<m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1> = 0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final probability.**\n    The probability is the square of this inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    This means it is impossible to measure $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ simultaneously when the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$. The sum of the individual z-component measurements must equal the total z-component of the system, i.e., $m_1+m_2 = m$. Here, $-1 + (-1) = -2 \\neq -1$.\n\n6.  **Confirmation using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.**\n    The relationship between the coupled basis $|l, m>$ and the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2>$ is given by the Clebsch-Gordan expansion:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l} |m_1, m_2>$\n    The coefficients $C_{m_1 m_2 m}^{l_1 l_2 l}$ are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n    The inner product we calculated is precisely one of these coefficients:\n    $<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}> = <m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1> = C_{-1, -1, -1}^{1, 1, 2}$.\n    Since $m_1+m_2 = -2$ and $m=-1$, the condition $m_1+m_2=m$ is not met. Thus, the coefficient is zero, confirming our previous reasoning. The expansion for $|l=2, m=-1>$ only contains terms where $m_1+m_2=-1$, which are $|m_1=0, m_2=-1>$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0>$. The state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$ is not part of this superposition.\n\nThe joint probability is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
