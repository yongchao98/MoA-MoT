    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** We can write the luminosity for each star:\n    $L_1 = 4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    The ratio is:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Radius Information:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$).\n    Therefore, the ratio of the radii is $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$.\n    Plugging this into our equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a black body's temperature (T) to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max, em}$), i.e., its peak emitted wavelength. The formula is $\\lambda_{max, em} = b/T$, where 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The problem states that the \"wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest\" are the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$), which can be different from the emitted wavelength due to the star's motion relative to the observer (Doppler effect). The relationship for non-relativistic speeds is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.\n    *   **Applying to Both Stars:**\n        *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_{r1} = 0$. So, its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted peak wavelength:\n            $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 1} = b/T_1$\n        *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Its observed peak wavelength is:\n            $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2} * (1 + v_{r2}/c) = (b/T_2) * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   **Finding the Temperature Ratio:** We are told $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n        $b/T_1 = (b/T_2) * (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n        Dividing both sides by 'b' and rearranging gives:\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** Now we substitute the values for $v_{r2}$ (700 km/s) and c (the speed of light, ~299,792.458 km/s) to find the temperature ratio, and then the final luminosity ratio. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nLet's perform the final calculation using a python script for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given information\n# Ratio of radii\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2 = 700.0\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the temperatures (T1/T2)\n# From Wien's Law and the Doppler effect, we derived: T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\nT1_over_T2 = 1.0 / (1.0 + v2 / c)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the luminosities (L1/L2)\n# The formula is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL1_over_L2 = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\nprint(L1_over_L2)\n```\n2.22912001509652\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe result 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>",
