    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism.\n\n**Understanding Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Stereocenter):** A carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has a chiral axis. A common example is atropisomerism in substituted biphenyls where rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted.\n3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a molecule that has a chiral plane.\n\nA molecule is **achiral** (and does not show optical isomerism) if it has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. Two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** There are four substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') relative to the bond connecting the rings. These substituents are two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The substituents at the ortho positions are large and bulky. This steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single C-C bond that connects them. Because the rotation is locked, the rings are forced to be in different planes (non-coplanar). The molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This condition, known as atropisomerism, results in a chiral axis along the C-C bond. Therefore, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, there is a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It has no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
