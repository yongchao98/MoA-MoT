    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$) into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. The Decay Process**\n\nThe decay is given by:\n$Pi^+ -> mu^+ + nu$\n\nThe initial particle, the positive pion ($Pi^+$), is stationary.\n\n**2. Given Information**\n\n*   Rest mass energy of $Pi^+$ ($m_{pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of $mu^+$ ($m_{mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino ($nu$) is considered massless, so its rest mass energy ($m_{nu}c^2$) is 0 MeV.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** Since the $Pi^+$ is stationary, its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon ($E_{mu}$) and the neutrino ($E_{nu}$). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n    $E_{final} = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n    $E_{mu} = m_{mu}c^2 + KE_{mu}$\n    $E_{nu} = m_{nu}c^2 + KE_{nu} = 0 + KE_{nu} = KE_{nu}$\n\n*   **Equating Energies:**\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $m_{pi}c^2 = (m_{mu}c^2 + KE_{mu}) + KE_{nu}$\n    $139.6 \\text{ MeV} = 105.7 \\text{ MeV} + KE_{mu} + KE_{nu}$\n    $KE_{mu} + KE_{nu} = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9$ MeV\n\nThis value, 33.9 MeV, is the total kinetic energy released in the decay (also known as the Q-value). The sum of the kinetic energies of the products must equal this value.\n\n**4. Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n*   **Initial Momentum ($p_{initial}$):** The $Pi^+$ is stationary, so its momentum is zero.\n    $p_{initial} = 0$\n\n*   **Final Momentum ($p_{final}$):** The final momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the muon ($p_{mu}$) and the neutrino ($p_{nu}$). To conserve momentum, they must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes.\n    $p_{final} = p_{mu} + p_{nu} = 0$\n    This implies that their magnitudes are equal: $|p_{mu}| = |p_{nu}| = p$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Kinetic Energies**\n\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom the conservation laws, we can derive a formula for the total energy of the muon ($E_{mu}$):\n$E_{mu} = \\frac{(m_{pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{pi}c^2)}$\n\nLet's calculate $E_{mu}$ and then find the kinetic energies.\n```python\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon using the derived formula\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# From conservation of energy, the total energy released is shared between the products\n# m_pi_c2 = E_mu + E_nu\n# Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy (E_nu = KE_nu)\nKE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.3f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.3f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.116 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.784 MeV\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that:\n*   The kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{mu}$) is approximately **4.12 MeV**.\n*   The kinetic energy of the neutrino ($KE_{nu}$) is approximately **29.8 MeV**.\n\nThese values match option B.\n\nWe can also check this by seeing which of the options sums to the Q-value of 33.9 MeV:\nA) 7.2 + 32.8 = 40.0 MeV\nB) 4.12 + 29.8 = 33.92 MeV\nC) 2.84 + 26.8 = 29.64 MeV\nD) 3.52 + 20.8 = 24.32 MeV\n\nOnly option B has kinetic energies that sum to the total energy released, confirming it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$) into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we will apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Define the System and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Decay Reaction:** $Pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n*   **Initial State:** The $Pi^+$ is stationary.\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_i$): This is purely the rest mass energy of the pion, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_i$): Since the pion is at rest, $p_i = 0$.\n*   **Final State:** The products are the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$).\n    *   Final Energy ($E_f$): This is the sum of the total energies of the products, $E_f = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Final Momentum ($p_f$): This is the vector sum of the momenta of the products, $\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** $E_i = E_f \\implies m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** $\\vec{p}_i = \\vec{p}_f \\implies 0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$. This means the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes: $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$.\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n\nWe can write this for our product particles:\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu}^2 = (p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   For the neutrino ($\\nu$): We assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$). Thus, its energy-momentum relation simplifies to $E_{\\nu}^2 = (p_{\\nu}c)^2$, or $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu}c$. Since kinetic energy is total energy minus rest energy, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = E_{\\nu}$.\n\n**3. Solving for the Energies**\n\nWe can combine the conservation laws to solve for the energies of the products. A standard formula derived for two-body decay gives the total energy of one of the products (in this case, the muon):\n\n$E_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\nSince we assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$), the formula simplifies to:\n\n$E_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\nOnce we find the total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$), we can find its kinetic energy ($KE_{\\mu}$) and the neutrino's kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu}$).\n*   $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n*   From energy conservation, $E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\mu}$. Since the neutrino is massless, $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n\nLet's use the given values to calculate the result.\n*   Rest mass energy of $Pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$): 105.7 MeV\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon using the derived formula\n# E_mu = ( (m_pi_c2)^2 + (m_mu_c2)^2 ) / ( 2 * m_pi_c2 )\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# From energy conservation, the total energy of the neutrino is the remaining energy\n# E_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n# Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\nKE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to match the options\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nKinetic energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately **4.12 MeV** and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.78).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
