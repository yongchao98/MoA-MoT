    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple geometry like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when considering the radiation in the far-field (radiation zone).\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency of oscillation, the amplitude of the dipole moment, and fundamental physical constants.\n*   `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (which is the z-axis in this problem).\n\nThe function `f` mentioned in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, `A = f_max ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. This fraction is `f(λ, 30°) / A`.\n\nFraction = `(C * sin²(30°)) / (C * sin²(90°))`\nFraction = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `sin(90°) = 1`.\n\nFraction = `(1/2)² / 1²`\nFraction = `1/4`\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nNow, let's determine the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. The constant `C` in the formula above is not truly constant with respect to frequency or wavelength. The full formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle is:\n\n`dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32 π² ε₀ c³) * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `p₀` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe key relationship is the dependence on the angular frequency `ω`. The radiated power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n`f ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is:\n`ω = 2π / T = 2π * (frequency) = 2π * (c / λ)`\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality:\n`f ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴`\n`f ∝ 1 / λ⁴`\n`f ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering (which explains why the sky is blue).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nCombining these two results, we match option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the fraction of maximum power at theta = 30 degrees.\n# The angular dependence of the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta).\n# The maximum power is radiated at theta = 90 degrees, where sin^2(90) = 1.\n\ntheta = 30  # degrees\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta)\n\n# Fraction = (Power at 30 deg) / (Maximum Power)\n# Fraction = sin^2(30) / sin^2(90)\nfraction = (math.sin(theta_rad))**2 / (math.sin(math.radians(90)))**2\n\nprint(f\"The fraction of maximum power at 30 degrees is: {fraction}\")\nprint(\"The wavelength dependence of radiated power for an oscillating dipole is λ^(-4).\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct option combines the fraction 1/4 and the wavelength dependence λ^(-4).\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "An oscillating charge distribution, such as a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when considering the radiation in the far-field (radiation zone).\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is described by the Larmor formula, which has an angular dependence of:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nHere, `θ` is the angle between the axis of oscillation (the z-axis) and the direction of observation. The function `f(λ, θ)` in the question represents this power per unit solid angle.\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). This maximum power is given as `A`.\n\n`A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\nWe need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` as a fraction of this maximum power `A`.\n\nPower at 30° `∝ sin²(30°)`\n\nThe fraction is:\nFraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power `A`) = `sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2` and `sin(90°) = 1`.\n\nFraction = `(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4`\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency, `ω⁴`. Since the power per unit solid angle `f` is just the total power distributed over a sphere with the `sin²(θ)` factor, it also has the same frequency dependence.\n\n`f ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n\n`f ∝ (1/λ)⁴`\n`f ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is a hallmark of dipole radiation and is famously responsible for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two parts:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
