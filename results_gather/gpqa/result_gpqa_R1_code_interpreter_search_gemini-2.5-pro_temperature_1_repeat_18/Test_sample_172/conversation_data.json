    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\n### **1. Identify the Core Principles**\n\nThe problem involves uncertainties in position and energy, which points directly to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**. There are two relevant forms:\n1.  **Position-Momentum Uncertainty:**  Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n2.  **Energy-Time Uncertainty:** ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nHere, Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\nThe problem gives us Δx and asks for ΔE. There is no direct formula linking Δx and ΔE, so we must find a relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) to connect the two principles.\n\n### **2. Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's energy and momentum is a fundamental equation. Since the electron's speed (v = 2 * 10^8 m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 * 10^8 m/s), we must use the **relativistic energy-momentum relation**:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nWhere:\n*   E is the total relativistic energy.\n*   p is the relativistic momentum.\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nTo find the relationship between the uncertainties (small changes), we can differentiate E with respect to p:\nd/dp [E²] = d/dp [(pc)² + (m₀c²)²]\n2E * (dE/dp) = 2p * c² + 0\ndE/dp = (pc²) / E\n\nFor small uncertainties, we can approximate them as differentials:\nΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp\nΔE ≈ (pc²/E) * Δp\n\nA key result from relativistic mechanics is that the derivative dE/dp is equal to the particle's velocity, `v`.\n*   Relativistic Energy: E = γm₀c²\n*   Relativistic Momentum: p = γm₀v\n*   (pc²)/E = ( (γm₀v)c² ) / (γm₀c²) = v\n\nSo, the relationship simplifies beautifully to:\n**ΔE ≈ v * Δp**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nUsing the position-momentum uncertainty principle, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min) from the given uncertainty in position (Δx).\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n### **4. Combine and Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE_min)**\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for Δp_min into our ΔE equation:\n\nΔE_min = v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\nLet's plug in the known values:\n*   v = 2 * 10^8 m/s\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 2 * 10**8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1 * 10**-9  # uncertainty in position in meters\n\n# Constants\nhbar = 1.054571817 * 10**-34  # reduced Planck constant in J.s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.3e} J\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.055e-16 J\n</execute_code>\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation shows that the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy is approximately **1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nOur calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Identify the Relevant Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves the uncertainty in an electron's position (Δx) and asks for the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This points to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**. The two primary forms are:\n\n*   **Position-Momentum Uncertainty:** Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n*   **Energy-Time Uncertainty:** ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWe are given Δx and asked for ΔE. There is no direct formula linking these two in the uncertainty principle itself. We must find a relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) to connect them.\n\n### **2. Relate Energy Uncertainty to Momentum Uncertainty**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy and its momentum depends on its speed. The electron's speed is given as v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s, which is about 2/3 the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s). Because this speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the **relativistic energy-momentum relation**:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nWhere `m₀` is the rest mass of the electron.\n\nTo find the relationship between the uncertainties (which are small changes), we can treat them as differentials and find the derivative of E with respect to p:\n\nd/dp [E²] = d/dp [(pc)² + (m₀c²)²]\n2E (dE/dp) = 2p c²\ndE/dp = pc² / E\n\nIt is a key result of special relativity that for a particle with velocity `v`, the term `pc²/E` is equal to `v`. Therefore:\n\ndE/dp = v\n\nFor small uncertainties, we can approximate this relationship as:\n\n**ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp**\n\nThis crucial step connects the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in momentum via the particle's velocity.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nUsing the position-momentum uncertainty principle, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min) from the given uncertainty in position (Δx = 0.1 nm = 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\nWhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n### **4. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow we combine the equations from steps 2 and 3:\n\nΔE_min = v ⋅ Δp_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Δx = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ ( (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 10⁻¹⁰ m) )\nΔE_min = (10⁸) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ / 10⁻¹⁰) J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁸ × 10⁻²⁴ J\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis result is approximately **10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nComparing our calculated result with the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
