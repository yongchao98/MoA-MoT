    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration that is undergoing significant hydrogen bonding. Such a broad peak is highly characteristic of the hydroxyl group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position is consistent with the C=O group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl functional group:\n        *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n        *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 16 amu\n        *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n        *   Mass of -COOH = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   The presence of a fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is strong evidence for the [COOH]⁺ fragment, confirming that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### **2. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options**\n\nFrom the analysis, we have concluded that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a -COOH group and a C=C group.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This allows us to eliminate the options with only one oxygen:\n    *   A) C6H10O (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C6H12O (Incorrect)\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. We can differentiate between them using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which represents the sum of rings and π-bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The spectroscopic data revealed the presence of:\n        *   One C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n        *   One C=C bond (from the alkene), which accounts for **1 degree of unsaturation**.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n3.  **Calculate DoU for the remaining formulas:** The formula for DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 has a Degree of Unsaturation of 2, which perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond identified from the spectra. The formula C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), contradicting the evidence for a C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula for the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
