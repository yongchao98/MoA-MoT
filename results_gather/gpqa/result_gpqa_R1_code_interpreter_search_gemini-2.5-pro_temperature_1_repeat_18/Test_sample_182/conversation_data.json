    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactant Structure**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex-3-ene`**: This is the parent structure.\n    *   It's a six-membered ring, which contributes **1** to the IHD.\n    *   The `-3-ene` suffix indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, which contributes another **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`-carboxylic acid`**: This is a -COOH group. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`2-formyl`**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde). It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **`5-vinyl`**: This is a -CH=CH₂ group. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n\n**Calculating the IHD of the reactant:**\nTotal IHD = (from ring) + (from C=C in ring) + (from C=O in acid) + (from C=O in formyl) + (from C=C in vinyl)\nTotal IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds down to a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\nSpecifically, the following transformations will occur:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** (aldehyde) group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   All **carbon-carbon double bonds** (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe carbon ring structure itself is not broken by this reagent.\n\n### **3. Predict the Product Structure**\n\nApplying the reaction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the internal C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The `formyl` group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at position 5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) as its C=C bond is saturated.\n\nThe final product is a substituted **cyclohexane**. It is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**. All the C=C and C=O bonds have been converted to single bonds, and all oxygen atoms have been removed.\n\n### **4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the final product can be determined by examining its structure:\n*   It has **one ring** (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   It has **zero pi bonds** (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is simply the contribution from the ring.\nIHD (product) = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula. The reactant's carbon skeleton has 10 carbons (6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl). This C₁₀ skeleton is preserved. Since the product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. Comparing this to the options provided:\nA) 5\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
