    "*   **Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Starting material):** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde.\n        *   The structure is a benzene ring (phenyl group, C6H5) attached to a *trans*-propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO).\n        *   Let's count the carbon atoms in *trans*-cinnamaldehyde:\n            *   Phenyl group: 6 carbons\n            *   Alkene and aldehyde group (-CH=CH-CHO): 3 carbons\n            *   Total carbons in cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 3 = 9 carbons.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr).\n        *   This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH3-).\n    *   **Reaction:** The Grignard reagent will attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. This is a 1,2-addition reaction. The C=O double bond breaks, and after an acidic workup (a standard step after a Grignard reaction), the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 1:** The methyl group from CH3MgBr is added to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   Initial structure: C6H5-CH=CH-CHO (9 carbons)\n        *   A CH3 group (1 carbon) is added.\n        *   The structure of Product 1 is C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3, which is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.\n        *   Number of carbon atoms in Product 1 = 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from methyl group) = 10 carbons.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 1, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, which is a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent. It is specifically used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones without affecting other sensitive functional groups like double bonds.\n    *   **Reaction:** PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 to a ketone group (-C(=O)-). The reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n    *   **Product 2:** The structure is C6H5-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3, which is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (also known as benzalacetone).\n    *   Number of carbon atoms in Product 2 = 10 carbons.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 2, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, [(CH3)2S(O)CH2], also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n    *   **Reaction:** This reagent is a sulfur ylide. When it reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones, it adds a methylene group (–CH2–) across the carbon-carbon double bond (a conjugate addition followed by intramolecular ring closure) to form a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   **Product 3:** A CH2 group (1 carbon) is added to Product 2. The double bond becomes part of a three-membered ring.\n        *   Structure of Product 2: C6H5-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3 (10 carbons)\n        *   A CH2 group (1 carbon) is added across the C=C bond.\n        *   The resulting structure is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n        *   Number of carbon atoms in Product 3 = 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the ylide's methylene group) = 11 carbons.\n\nLet's confirm the carbon count of the final product, 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one:\n*   Phenyl group: 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropyl ring: 3 carbons\n*   Ethanone group (-C(=O)CH3): 2 carbons\n*   Total carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbons. However, the phenyl group and ethanone group are substituents on the cyclopropane ring, so some carbons are shared in this naming convention. A direct count from the structure formed is more reliable:\n    *   C6H5- (6C) + -CH- (1C) + -CH- (1C) + -C(=O)- (1C) + -CH3 (1C) + added -CH2- (1C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
