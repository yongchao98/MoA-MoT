    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two successive electric dipole transitions, which means it's a cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   **First transition:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$. So, for the intermediate state, $l'$ must be $l \\pm 1 = 1$.\n        *   Initial state has $m=0$. So, $m'$ can be $m \\pm 1, 0$, which means $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Since it's a decay, $n'$ must be less than $n=3$. So $n'$ could be 1 or 2.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   The final state has $l_{final}=0$. The intermediate state must have $l'=1$ to satisfy $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with our finding from the first transition.\n        *   The final state has $m_{final}=0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$. This is also consistent.\n        *   Since it's a decay to the $n=1$ state, the intermediate state must have $n' > 1$.\n    *   **Combining the conditions:** We need $l'=1$, $n'<3$, and $n'>1$. The only possibility for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The cascade must proceed through one of these three states.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Branching Ratios:**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step, as the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) is the only significant decay path from the $2p$ state and thus has a probability of ~1.\n\n    The transition rate ($A$) for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $A_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$\n\n    The initial state is $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This state is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). The final states are $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$ for $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n    Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the total transition rate should not depend on the orientation ($m'$) of the final angular momentum state. This implies that the transition rates to each of the degenerate final states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal.\n\n    Let's verify this with a calculation. The rate is proportional to:\n    $A(m') \\propto |\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    Let the radial part of the integral be $I_R = \\int_0^\\infty r^3 R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) dr$, which is a constant factor for all $m'$. The relative rates are determined by the angular part.\n    *   For the transition to $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the matrix element $\\langle 2,1,0 | z | 3,0,0 \\rangle$ is non-zero, while the $x$ and $y$ matrix elements are zero. The rate is $A(m'=0) \\propto (I_R/\\sqrt{3})^2 = I_R^2/3$.\n    *   For the transition to $|2,1,1\\rangle$, the matrix elements for $x$ and $y$ are non-zero, while the $z$ element is zero. The rate is $A(m'=1) \\propto |\\langle x \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle y \\rangle|^2 = I_R^2/6 + I_R^2/6 = I_R^2/3$.\n    *   For the transition to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, similarly, the rate is $A(m'=-1) \\propto |\\langle x \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle y \\rangle|^2 = I_R^2/6 + I_R^2/6 = I_R^2/3$.\n\n    Since the rates $A(m'=-1)$, $A(m'=0)$, and $A(m'=1)$ are all equal, the total transition rate is $A_{total} = A(-1)+A(0)+A(1) \\propto I_R^2$.\n\n    The branching ratio for decaying into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $Br(m') = \\frac{A(m')}{A_{total}} = \\frac{I_R^2/3}{I_R^2} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Determine the Probability of the Full Cascade:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = Br(m') \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    This means each of the three possible routes has a probability of $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability $2/3$. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability $1/4$. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability $1/4$. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with probability $1/3$. (Correct)\n\nThe correct option is D, as it matches our calculated probability for that specific transition path.\n\n<<<D>>>"
