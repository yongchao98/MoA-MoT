    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C6H5-X). The substituent (X) on the ring determines two things:\n*   **Reactivity:** Activating groups (Electron Donating Groups, EDG) speed up the reaction, while deactivating groups (Electron Withdrawing Groups, EWG) slow it down.\n*   **Orientation:** The substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to specific positions.\n    *   **Ortho, para-directors:** These are all activating groups (like -CH3, -C2H5) and the halogens (-Cl). They direct the incoming group to the positions ortho (2,6) and para (4) to the substituent.\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These are all deactivating groups (except halogens), such as -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5. They direct the incoming group to the meta position (3,5).\n\nThe question asks to order the substances by the increasing yield of the **para-isomer**.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect. This allows us to separate the compounds into two groups: those that will produce a high yield of the para-isomer and those that will produce a very low yield.\n\n*   **Substance 1: C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**\n    *   -CH3 (methyl) is an activating group (EDG) and is **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **Substance 2: C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**\n    *   -COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating group (EWG) and is **meta-directing**.\n*   **Substance 3: C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**\n    *   -Cl (chloro) is a deactivating group but is **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **Substance 4: C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**\n    *   -NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating group (EWG) and is **meta-directing**.\n*   **Substance 5: C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**\n    *   -C2H5 (ethyl) is an activating group (EDG) and is **ortho, para-directing**.\n*   **Substance 6: C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**\n    *   -COOH (carboxylic acid) is a deactivating group (EWG) and is **meta-directing**.\n\n**Grouping:**\n*   **Low para yield (meta-directors):** 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), 4 (C6H5-NO2), 6 (C6H5-COOH)\n*   **High para yield (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (C6H5-CH3), 3 (C6H5-Cl), 5 (C6H5-C2H5)\n\nThe final ordered list will have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely small. The amount of para product formed is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. The stronger the deactivating group, the more it suppresses reaction at the ortho and para positions, and thus the lower the para yield.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   -NO2 is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   -COOH is a strong deactivating group.\n*   -COOC2H5 is also a strong deactivating group, but slightly weaker than -COOH because the ethyl group (-C2H5) is more electron-donating than the hydrogen atom in -COOH.\n\nDeactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order.\nIncreasing para-isomer yield: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5\nOrder of substances: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor these substances, a significant amount of the para-isomer is formed. The relative yield of para vs. ortho product depends on both electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Substance 3 (C6H5-Cl):** Halogens are a special case. Despite being deactivating, they are ortho, para-directing. Due to their strong inductive electron-withdrawal (-I effect), which is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions, the ortho positions are significantly deactivated relative to the para position. This leads to a very high preference for para substitution. Chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%). Thus, **3 will have the highest para yield in this group**.\n\n*   **Substances 1 (C6H5-CH3) and 5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Both have activating alkyl groups. The primary factor used to distinguish the para/ortho ratio between them in an introductory context is **steric hindrance**. The ortho positions are adjacent to the substituent, so a bulkier substituent will block access to the ortho positions more effectively, favoring substitution at the less crowded para position.\n    *   Steric bulk: -C2H5 (ethyl) > -CH3 (methyl)\n    *   Because the ethyl group is bulkier, it will lead to a higher percentage of the para-isomer compared to the methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the increasing order of para yield is: C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5.\n    *   Order of substances: **1 < 5**\n\nCombining the o,p-directors, we get the order of increasing para yield: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Groups to Get the Final Order**\n\nNow, we combine the ordered lists of the two groups:\n(meta-directors) < (ortho, para-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of substances in terms of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
