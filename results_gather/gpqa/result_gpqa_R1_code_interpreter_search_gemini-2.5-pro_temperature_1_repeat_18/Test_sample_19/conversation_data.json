    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that a high-energy interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon within that nucleus. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the most fundamental assumption of the impulse approximation. It posits that the probe (e.g., a lepton or photon) interacts with a single nucleon at a time. This is often called the \"one-body current\" assumption. It neglects more complex interactions where the probe interacts with a pair of nucleons simultaneously (two-body currents) or with the meson fields that mediate the nuclear force (meson-exchange currents). Without this assumption, you cannot isolate a single nucleon as the target. Thus, this assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption deals with the dynamics before and after the primary interaction. It means we neglect \"initial state interactions\" (where the incoming probe scatters off other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon) and \"final state interactions\" (where the struck nucleon or other outgoing particles scatter off the remaining nucleons on their way out of the nucleus). If the nucleus were not \"transparent,\" these secondary interactions would complicate the process, and the simple picture of a single, clean interaction would break down. This is crucial for the nucleon to appear \"free\" in the context of the entire scattering process.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, typically described within the framework of the quark model. The impulse approximation, as it's usually applied in nuclear physics, is about the behavior of the *nucleon* as a whole within the *nucleus*. It is largely independent of the specific model used to describe the nucleon's internal structure. For example, the impulse approximation is also used in deep inelastic scattering where the quarks are treated as highly relativistic partons. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation at the nuclear level.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction time is assumed to be so short that the forces binding the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus do not have time to act *during* the interaction. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in its state of motion within the nucleus at the moment of the interaction. While its initial state is that of a bound particle (with a certain momentum distribution dictated by the nuclear potential), its interaction with the probe is treated as if it were a free particle with that instantaneous momentum. This is a central tenet of the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation is built on three key ideas:\n- The interaction happens with only one nucleon (Statement 1).\n- The nucleon is treated as a free particle during the very short interaction time, ignoring its binding potential (Statement 4).\n- The rest of the nucleus is a spectator and does not interfere with the incoming probe or the outgoing particles (Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
