Dissociation Reaction:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻, dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (EDTA⁴⁻) according to the following equilibrium reaction:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**2. Equilibrium Constants:**\nThe problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the complex, which represents the equilibrium for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻).\n*   K_f = 5.0 x 10¹⁰\n\nTo analyze the dissociation, we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n*   K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant is:\n*   K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n**3. Equilibrium Calculation:**\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species        | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nNow, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_d expression:\n*   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n**4. Solving for x:**\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small. This means the complex is very stable and will dissociate very little. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n*   2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺:\n*   x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n*   x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n*   x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n*   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.\n2.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant (K_f) for Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca-EDTA]^2-, which is K_f = 5x10^10. The reaction we are interested in is the dissociation, so we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant: K_d = 1 / K_f.\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that form at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]^2- complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus 'x'.\n    *   [Ca-EDTA]^2- = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca^2+] = x\n    *   [EDTA^4-] = x\n4.  **Write the K_d Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is K_d = ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]. Substituting the terms from the ICE table, we get K_d = (x * x) / (0.02 - x).\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:** Since the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d will be very small. This implies that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. The equation simplifies to K_d ≈ x^2 / 0.02.\n6.  **Calculate 'x':** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for 'x', which represents the concentration of calcium ions.\n7.  **Compare with Options:** Match the calculated value of 'x' with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\ninitial_conc_complex = 0.02  # M\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\n\n# The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n# The equilibrium reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# The equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\nK_d = 1 / K_f\n\n# Let x be the equilibrium concentration of Ca^2+ ions.\n# From the stoichiometry, [EDTA^4-] will also be x.\n# The equilibrium concentration of the complex will be (initial_conc_complex - x).\n# The expression for K_d is: K_d = ([Ca^2+] * [EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]\n# K_d = (x * x) / (initial_conc_complex - x)\n\n# Since K_f is very large, K_d is very small, meaning x will be very small compared to 0.02.\n# We can simplify the equation by approximating (initial_conc_complex - x) ≈ initial_conc_complex.\n# So, K_d ≈ x^2 / initial_conc_complex\n\n# Now, we solve for x:\n# x^2 ≈ K_d * initial_conc_complex\nx_squared = K_d * initial_conc_complex\n\n# x is the square root of x_squared\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of calcium ions is x.\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of calcium ions [Ca^2+] is: {x:.2e} M\")\n\n# The provided options are:\n# A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n# B) 2.0x10^-2 M\n# C) 6.3x10^-7 M\n# D) 5.0x10^-3 M\n# The calculated value 6.32e-07 M matches option C.\nprint(\"The correct option is C.\")\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\n*   The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as CaY²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand).\n*   This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n*   The formation reaction is: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻. The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, Kf, given as KCa-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n*   Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, we need to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\n\n*   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf).\n*   Kd = 1 / Kf\n*   Kd = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 0.2 x 10⁻¹⁰ = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\n\n*   An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table helps track the concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n*   **Reaction:**      CaY²⁻   ⇌   Ca²⁺   +   Y⁴⁻\n*   **Initial (I):**    0.02 M        0 M        0 M\n    *   We start with 0.02 M of the stoichiometric complex and assume no free ions are present initially.\n*   **Change (C):**      -x           +x         +x\n    *   For every mole of CaY²⁻ that dissociates, one mole of Ca²⁺ and one mole of Y⁴⁻ are formed.\n*   **Equilibrium (E):** (0.02 - x) M    x M        x M\n    *   The equilibrium concentrations are the sum of the initial and change rows.\n\n**4.

Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The formation constant (Kf) is very large, which means the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

The complex is formed by the reaction of a calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) with an EDTA anion ($EDTA^{4-}$). The equilibrium for the formation is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given as:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Consider the Dissociation:** We are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex will dissociate slightly to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium.

This means the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction, and the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents the concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n\n    The calculation was performed using the Python script, which yielded:\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for this reaction is given as 5x10¹⁰.\n\nThe problem involves the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), sometimes called the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table (ICE table) to find the concentration of the dissociated ions.

Dissociation Reaction:**\nThe Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻, dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (EDTA⁴⁻) according to the following equilibrium reaction:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**2.

This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. The reaction is: [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.\n2.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant:** We are given the formation constant (K_f) for Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- <=> [Ca-EDTA]^2-, which is K_f = 5x10^10. The reaction we are interested in is the dissociation, so we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant: K_d = 1 / K_f.\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that form at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be 'x', and the concentration of the [Ca-EDTA]^2- complex will be its initial concentration (0.02 M) minus 'x'.\n    *   [Ca-EDTA]^2- = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca^2+] = x\n    *   [EDTA^4-] = x\n4.  **Write the K_d Expression:** The expression for the dissociation constant is K_d = ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]. Substituting the terms from the ICE table, we get K_d = (x * x) / (0.02 - x).\n5.  **Simplify and Solve:** Since the formation constant K_f is very large, the dissociation constant K_d will be very small. This implies that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The formation constant (Kf) is very large, which means the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n*   We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nWe can now solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻²) / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nLet 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex at equilibrium will be its initial concentration minus the amount that has dissociated.\n\nThe setup for the equilibrium concentrations is as follows:\n*   **[Ca²⁺] = x**\n*   **[EDTA⁴⁻] = x**\n*   **[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x**\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and only a very small amount will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows for a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.
