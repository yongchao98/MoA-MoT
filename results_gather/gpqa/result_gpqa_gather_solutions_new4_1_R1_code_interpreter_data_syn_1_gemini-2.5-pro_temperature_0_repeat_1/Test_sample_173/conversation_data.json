A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses).

Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n`m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the total kinetic energy (`T_total`) of the two fragments.\n\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = (M - (m1 + m2)) * c^2`\n`T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nTherefore:\n`T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n`T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we have:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe know that `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** It splits into two fragments with rest masses m₁ and m₂.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   The more massive fragment (m₁) is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we can solve for the masses:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **Energy of fragment 1 (E₁):** E₁ = m₁*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   **Energy of fragment 2 (E₂):** E₂ = m₂*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   **Q = (M*c²) - (m₁*c² + m₂*c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ (Relativistic)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude (p₁ = p₂).\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The kinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - m*c²).\n\nFrom these, we can derive the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum:\n(p*c)² = T * (T + 2*m*c²)\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²:\nT₁ * (T₁ + 2*m₁*c²) = T₂ * (T₂ + 2*m₂*c²)\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 - T₁, m₁*c² = 198 GeV, and m₂*c² = 99 GeV. Substituting these values:\nT₁ * (T₁ + 2 * 198) = (3 - T₁) * ((3 - T₁) + 2 * 99)\nT₁ * (T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁) * (3 - T₁ + 198)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (3 - T₁) * (201 - T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = 603 - 201*T₁ - 3*T₁ + T₁²\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁ + T₁²\n396*T₁ + 204*T₁ = 603\n600*T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\n√(2 * m₁ * T₁_classical) = √(2 * m₂ * T₂_classical)\nm₁ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, it follows that:\n2 * m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical\nT₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (1): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (2): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy ($Mc^2$) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies ($T_1$ and $T_2$). The total kinetic energy released, known as the Q-value, is:\n    $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - E_{final, rest}$\n    $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n    $\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0 \\implies \\vec{p}_1 = -\\vec{p}_2$\n    This means their momentum magnitudes are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n*   $T_1 = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_2 = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nFrom these equations, we see that $T_1 m_1 = T_2 m_2$. Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, it follows that $T_1 (2m_2) = T_2 m_2$, which simplifies to $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n$T_1 + T_2 = Q$\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = Q$\n$3T_1 = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = Q/3 = 3 \\text{ GeV} / 3 = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nRearranging the energy-momentum relation gives:\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince $p_1 = p_2$, we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substitute this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nCancel $T_1^2$ from both sides and group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNote that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 + Q = 297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV} = 300 \\text{ GeV} = Mc^2$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2)] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, plug in the values (in GeV):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is the correct value minus the classical approximation:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\nDifference = $5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial and final states and extract given values.**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   The nucleus splits into nothing else, so energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We designate $m_1$ as the more massive fragment.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the rest masses (and rest energies) of the two fragments.**\n\n1.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n3.  Now find $m_1$:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n4.  Calculate their rest energies using the initial rest energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   Rest energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy.\n*   $Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final total rest energy})$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Conservation of Momentum.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so its momentum was zero.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$) using the classical approximation.**\n\n1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n2.  Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$):\n    *   $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n3.  The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n4.  This gives us the relation $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n5.  Using the total kinetic energy, $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$).**\n\n1.  We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n2.  Rearranging for momentum, and using the total energy $E = T + m_0c^2$, we get:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n3.  Since momentum is conserved ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\n4.  Substitute the known values: $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$, and $T_2 = 3 - T_1$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$.\n5.  Simplify the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n    *   $396T_1 = -204T_1 + 603$.\n    *   $600T_1 = 603$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{correct}} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the difference and convert units.**\n\n1.  The difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n2.  Convert the result from GeV to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The phrase \"2 times more massive\" was interpreted as $m_1 = 2m_2$, which is standard in physics problems and leads to a valid answer choice.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both energy and momentum conservation were correctly applied.\n*   **Formulas:** The distinct formulas for kinetic energy and its relation to momentum in classical vs. relativistic mechanics were used.\n*   **Units:** All calculations were performed consistently in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV as required by the answer options.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Define the System and Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with mass `M`.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    1.  The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of the lighter one `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n        `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`):\n        `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T1 + T2`\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1_cl = p2_cl`).\n\n*   The kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum is also conserved (`p1 = p2`). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore, `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the equation:\n    `(T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Expanding the terms (`(a+b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab`):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe code output `4.999999999999893` is a result of floating-point precision in computation, which is effectively 5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is $P_{initial} = 0$.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the more massive fragment as $m_1$ and the lighter one as $m_2$. So, $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_1 + T_2$).\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T_{cl} = p^2 / (2m)$.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum:\n$Q = T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3T_{1,cl}$\nSolving for the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:\n$T_{1,cl} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest-mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can express the momentum as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n\nAgain, conservation of momentum requires $p_1 = p_2$, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, which means $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. We rearrange the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = Mc^2 - Q$. Substituting this in:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2 - Q) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2Mc^2] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Properties**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A single nucleus at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m2`: `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy**\n\n*   The total energy is conserved. The initial energy (all rest-mass energy) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energy.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy released, `T_total = T1 + T2`, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. The fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n*   `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting gives `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`, so `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formula**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest-mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   We can rearrange this to solve for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Since `E = T + m*c^2`, we can write `(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   From momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`.\n*   Now, substitute the known values: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`. This is the correct value for T1.\n\n**7.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of the initial mass M: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We can set up a system of equations for their rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2.

Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero. This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. Also, total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (T) and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSetting them equal and substituting `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2*m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2*m1) / (p^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5.

Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`):\n    `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`):\n    `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3.

Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero.

Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after. The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   Total kinetic energy (`T_total`): `T_total = T1 + T2 = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.

Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nFor relativistic calculations, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy of a fragment is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   So, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n\nSince the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nEquating the two expressions:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values into the equation:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396 * T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nNow, simplify the equation to solve for `T1`:\n*   `396 * T1 = -204 * T1 + 603`\n*   `600 * T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial nucleus: Mass M, at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Fission process: The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Mass relation of fragments: One is twice as massive as the other.

Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We are given:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The mass of the more massive fragment (m₁) is twice that of the less massive fragment (m₂): m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first relation into the second, we get:\n2 * m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = Initial Energy - Final Energy\n*   Q = (M*c²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we use the conservation of both energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where E is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) and p is the momentum.\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   E₁² = (p₁c)² + (m₁c²)²\n*   E₂² = (p₂c)² + (m₂c²)²\n\nSince |p₁| = |p₂|, we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)². Therefore:\nE₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n\nWe also know the total energy of the system is conserved:\nE₁ + E₂ = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\nE₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (39204 - 9801) GeV²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 29403 GeV²\nE₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\nE₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\nThe kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n*   T₁ (relativistic) = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Approximate (Classical) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m). From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\nm₁T₁ = m₂T₂\n\nUsing the mass relationship m₁ = 2m₂, we get:\n2m₂ * T₁ = m₂ * T₂\n2T₁ = T₂\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\nT₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\nSubstituting 2T₁ for T₂:\nT₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV\n3T₁ = 3 GeV\n*   T₁ (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConverting this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using both classical and relativistic mechanics.\n\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The initial nucleus had a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2m₂. This also means their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: m₁c² = 2(m₂c²).\n*   Substituting this into the sum: 2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV, which gives 3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n    *   m₂c² = 99 GeV (the less massive fragment)\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV (the more massive fragment)\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released:**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy (rest-mass energy of the nucleus) must equal the final energy (sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)\n*   300 GeV = 297 GeV + T₁ + T₂\n*   The total kinetic energy released is Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T₁:**\n\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², which can be rearranged to (pc)² = E² - (mc²)². Since E = T + mc², this becomes (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Applying this to both fragments:\n    *   (pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₁² + 2T₁(198)\n    *   (pc)² = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(99)\n*   Setting the expressions for (pc)² equal: T₁² + 396T₁ = T₂² + 198T₂.\n*   Substitute T₂ = 3 - T₁:\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (3 - T₁)² + 198(3 - T₁)\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    600T₁ = 603\n    T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation:**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n*   From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\n    T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2.\n*   So, T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n*   The total kinetic energy is T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T₂_classical: T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV, which gives 3T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   T₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Find the difference:**\n\n*   The difference is ΔT₁ = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical).\n*   ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   Converting to MeV: 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of a fission fragment using both relativistic and classical physics and then find the difference. My proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the rest masses of the two fragments using the given ratios. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. The final total rest mass is 99% of the initial, and one fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n2.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies (the Q-value).\n3.  Using conservation of momentum and the relativistic energy-momentum relation, set up an equation to solve for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1).\n4.  Repeat the calculation for T1 using the classical relationship between kinetic energy, momentum, and mass.\n5.  Finally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 and convert it to MeV.\n\nThis is a calculation-based problem, so no external search is needed.\n\n**Skeptic:** The proposed path is logical. However, I must raise a few points to ensure accuracy:\n1.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation involves solving a quadratic equation. A simple sign error or mistake in expansion could lead to an incorrect result. The algebraic steps must be double-checked.\n2.  **Formula Integrity:** The core of the relativistic calculation is the relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`. Is this formula correct? Yes, it derives directly from `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` and `E = T + mc^2`.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The application of conservation of energy (to find the total kinetic energy) and conservation of momentum (to relate the two fragments' energies) is fundamental. The assumption that momenta are equal and opposite (`|p1| = |p2|`) is correct for a decay from rest.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The initial data is in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. A final conversion step (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`) is required and must not be forgotten.\n\n**Decision:** The proposer's plan is sound, and the skeptic's concerns are valid checks on the execution rather than flaws in the plan itself.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Extract Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Fragment Properties:**\n    *   Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment. We are given `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, `T₁`, and the value calculated using the classical approximation, `T₁_classical`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses. We can solve this to find their rest-mass energies.\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M  =>  m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2m₂ = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, convert these masses to their corresponding rest-mass energies using `Mc² = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 0.66 × (Mc²) = 0.66 × 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 0.33 × (Mc²) = 0.33 × 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released during the fission is the mass defect, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n`Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us the relation `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `p₁ = p₂ = p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n*   We can express the momentum term `(pc)²` in terms of kinetic energy `T` (where `E = T + mc²`):\n    `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Now, substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation, and convert it to MeV.\n*   `Difference = T₁ - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Converting to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n    `Difference = 0.005 × 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_M = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m1`, and the less massive is `m2`.\n    *   Mass relationship: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments\n\nFrom the given relationships:\n`m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released\n\nThe energy released during the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the total kinetic energy (`T_total`) of the two fragments.\n\n`T_total = T1 + T2 = (M - (m1 + m2)) * c^2`\n`T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nTherefore:\n`T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n`T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of their kinetic energies:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, using the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`.\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we have:\n`(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe know that `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   **Final State:** It splits into two fragments with rest masses m₁ and m₂.\n*   **Given Conditions:**\n    *   The more massive fragment (m₁) is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we can solve for the masses:\n(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **Energy of fragment 1 (E₁):** E₁ = m₁*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   **Energy of fragment 2 (E₂):** E₂ = m₂*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   **Q = (M*c²) - (m₁*c² + m₂*c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ (Relativistic)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude (p₁ = p₂).\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)². The kinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - m*c²).\n\nFrom these, we can derive the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum:\n(p*c)² = T * (T + 2*m*c²)\n\nSince p₁ = p₂, we have (p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²:\nT₁ * (T₁ + 2*m₁*c²) = T₂ * (T₂ + 2*m₂*c²)\n\nWe know T₂ = 3 - T₁, m₁*c² = 198 GeV, and m₂*c² = 99 GeV. Substituting these values:\nT₁ * (T₁ + 2 * 198) = (3 - T₁) * ((3 - T₁) + 2 * 99)\nT₁ * (T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁) * (3 - T₁ + 198)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = (3 - T₁) * (201 - T₁)\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = 603 - 201*T₁ - 3*T₁ + T₁²\nT₁² + 396*T₁ = 603 - 204*T₁ + T₁²\n396*T₁ + 204*T₁ = 603\n600*T₁ = 603\n**T₁ = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\n√(2 * m₁ * T₁_classical) = √(2 * m₂ * T₂_classical)\nm₁ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical\n\nSince m₁ = 2 * m₂, it follows that:\n2 * m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical\nT₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\nT₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV\nT₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV\n**T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV:\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (1): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (2): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy ($Mc^2$) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies ($T_1$ and $T_2$). The total kinetic energy released, known as the Q-value, is:\n    $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - E_{final, rest}$\n    $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n    $\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0 \\implies \\vec{p}_1 = -\\vec{p}_2$\n    This means their momentum magnitudes are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n*   $T_1 = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_2 = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nFrom these equations, we see that $T_1 m_1 = T_2 m_2$. Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, it follows that $T_1 (2m_2) = T_2 m_2$, which simplifies to $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n$T_1 + T_2 = Q$\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = Q$\n$3T_1 = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = Q/3 = 3 \\text{ GeV} / 3 = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nRearranging the energy-momentum relation gives:\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince $p_1 = p_2$, we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substitute this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nCancel $T_1^2$ from both sides and group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNote that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 + Q = 297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV} = 300 \\text{ GeV} = Mc^2$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2)] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, plug in the values (in GeV):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is the correct value minus the classical approximation:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\nDifference = $5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the initial and final states and extract given values.**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   **Final State (after fission):**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   The nucleus splits into nothing else, so energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   One fragment is 2 times more massive than the other: $m_1 = 2m_2$. We designate $m_1$ as the more massive fragment.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the rest masses (and rest energies) of the two fragments.**\n\n1.  We have a system of two equations:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\n3.  Now find $m_1$:\n    *   $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n4.  Calculate their rest energies using the initial rest energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   Rest energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The Q-value is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass into kinetic energy.\n*   $Q = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final total rest energy})$\n*   $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n*   $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   This total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Conservation of Momentum.**\n\n*   The initial nucleus was at rest, so its momentum was zero.\n*   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$) using the classical approximation.**\n\n1.  In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n2.  Since the momenta are equal ($p_1 = p_2 = p$):\n    *   $T_1 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_1}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m_2}$.\n3.  The ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n    *   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{p^2/2m_1}{p^2/2m_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n4.  This gives us the relation $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n5.  Using the total kinetic energy, $T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$:\n    *   $T_1 + 2T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_1 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($T_1$).**\n\n1.  We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n2.  Rearranging for momentum, and using the total energy $E = T + m_0c^2$, we get:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n3.  Since momentum is conserved ($p_1 = p_2$), we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\n4.  Substitute the known values: $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$, $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$, and $T_2 = 3 - T_1$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$.\n    *   $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = T_1^2 - 204T_1 + 603$.\n5.  Simplify the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n    *   $396T_1 = -204T_1 + 603$.\n    *   $600T_1 = 603$.\n    *   $T_{1, \\text{correct}} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the difference and convert units.**\n\n1.  The difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$.\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n2.  Convert the result from GeV to MeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$):\n    *   $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The phrase \"2 times more massive\" was interpreted as $m_1 = 2m_2$, which is standard in physics problems and leads to a valid answer choice.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** Both energy and momentum conservation were correctly applied.\n*   **Formulas:** The distinct formulas for kinetic energy and its relation to momentum in classical vs. relativistic mechanics were used.\n*   **Units:** All calculations were performed consistently in GeV, with a final conversion to MeV as required by the answer options.\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### **1. Define the System and Given Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus at rest with mass `M`.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Conditions:**\n    1.  The more massive fragment `m1` is twice the mass of the lighter one `m2`: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations. We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\n\n1.  Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n2.  Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  Now, we can find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`):\n        `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment (`m2`):\n        `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T1 + T2`\n*   `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (`p1_cl = p2_cl`).\n\n*   The kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n    `T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_cl^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   `T1_cl / T2_cl = 99 / 198 = 1/2`, which means `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy:\n    `T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum is also conserved (`p1 = p2`). We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n*   Since the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   Therefore, `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the equation:\n    `(T1 + m1*c^2)^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (T2 + m2*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n*   Expanding the terms (`(a+b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab`):\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   Combine the `T1` terms:\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_cl`).\n\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_cl`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe code output `4.999999999999893` is a result of floating-point precision in computation, which is effectively 5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus with rest-mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_{initial} = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is $P_{initial} = 0$.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the more massive fragment as $m_1$ and the lighter one as $m_2$. So, $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can now find their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy $Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment ($m_2$): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_1 + T_2$).\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T_{cl} = p^2 / (2m)$.\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n$\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{0.33M}{0.66M} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSo, $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum:\n$Q = T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3T_{1,cl}$\nSolving for the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment:\n$T_{1,cl} = \\frac{Q}{3} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV}}{3} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T1:**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy E, momentum p, and rest-mass m is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nFrom this, we can express the momentum as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n\nAgain, conservation of momentum requires $p_1 = p_2$, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, which means $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. We rearrange the equation to solve for $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nWe know that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = Mc^2 - Q$. Substituting this in:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2 - Q) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2Mc^2] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values:\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_1 = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = $T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define Initial and Final State Properties**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A single nucleus at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which simplifies to `3*m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m2`: `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Solve for `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M`.\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy to Find Total Kinetic Energy**\n\n*   The total energy is conserved. The initial energy (all rest-mass energy) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energy.\n*   `E_initial = E_final`\n*   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n*   The total kinetic energy released, `T_total = T1 + T2`, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. The fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction.\n*   `|p1| = |p2|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses: `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting gives `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`, so `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**6.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of the initial mass M: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We can set up a system of equations for their rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero. This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c²) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. Also, total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (T) and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSetting them equal and substituting `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2*m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2*m1) / (p^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1.

Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nWe can determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments:\n\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`):\n    `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`):\n    `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3.

This energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy (T_total) = (M * c^2) - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero.

Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after. The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n    *   Total kinetic energy (`T_total`): `T_total = T1 + T2 = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.

Calculate the Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = Initial Energy - Final Energy\n*   Q = (M*c²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we use the conservation of both energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where E is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) and p is the momentum.\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   E₁² = (p₁c)² + (m₁c²)²\n*   E₂² = (p₂c)² + (m₂c²)²\n\nSince |p₁| = |p₂|, we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)². Therefore:\nE₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n\nWe also know the total energy of the system is conserved:\nE₁ + E₂ = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\nE₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (39204 - 9801) GeV²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 29403 GeV²\nE₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\nE₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\nThe kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n*   T₁ (relativistic) = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Approximate (Classical) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m). From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\nm₁T₁ = m₂T₂\n\nUsing the mass relationship m₁ = 2m₂, we get:\n2m₂ * T₁ = m₂ * T₂\n2T₁ = T₂\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\nT₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\nSubstituting 2T₁ for T₂:\nT₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV\n3T₁ = 3 GeV\n*   T₁ (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConverting this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully calculated the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using both classical and relativistic mechanics.\n\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The initial nucleus had a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. The two fragments had rest-mass energies of 198 GeV (massive fragment, m1) and 99 GeV (lighter fragment, m2). The total kinetic energy released was 3 GeV.\n*   **Classical Calculation:** The classical kinetic energy for the massive fragment (T1_classical) was calculated to be 1.0 GeV.\n*   **Relativistic Calculation:** The correct relativistic kinetic energy for the massive fragment (T1_relativistic) was calculated to be 1.005 GeV.\n*   **Final Result:** The difference between the relativistic and classical values is 1.005 GeV - 1.0 GeV = 0.005 GeV. Converting this to MeV (by multiplying by 1000) yields 5 MeV.\n\nThis result corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2m₂. This also means their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: m₁c² = 2(m₂c²).\n*   Substituting this into the sum: 2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV, which gives 3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n    *   m₂c² = 99 GeV (the less massive fragment)\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV (the more massive fragment)\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released:**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy (rest-mass energy of the nucleus) must equal the final energy (sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)\n*   300 GeV = 297 GeV + T₁ + T₂\n*   The total kinetic energy released is Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T₁:**\n\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², which can be rearranged to (pc)² = E² - (mc²)². Since E = T + mc², this becomes (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Applying this to both fragments:\n    *   (pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₁² + 2T₁(198)\n    *   (pc)² = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(99)\n*   Setting the expressions for (pc)² equal: T₁² + 396T₁ = T₂² + 198T₂.\n*   Substitute T₂ = 3 - T₁:\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (3 - T₁)² + 198(3 - T₁)\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    600T₁ = 603\n    T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation:**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n*   From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\n    T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2.\n*   So, T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n*   The total kinetic energy is T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T₂_classical: T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV, which gives 3T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   T₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Find the difference:**\n\n*   The difference is ΔT₁ = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical).\n*   ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   Converting to MeV: 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of a fission fragment using both relativistic and classical physics and then find the difference. My proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the rest masses of the two fragments using the given ratios. The initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. The final total rest mass is 99% of the initial, and one fragment is twice as massive as the other.\n2.  Calculate the total kinetic energy released in the fission, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies (the Q-value).\n3.  Using conservation of momentum and the relativistic energy-momentum relation, set up an equation to solve for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1).\n4.  Repeat the calculation for T1 using the classical relationship between kinetic energy, momentum, and mass.\n5.  Finally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 and convert it to MeV.\n\nThis is a calculation-based problem, so no external search is needed.\n\n**Skeptic:** The proposed path is logical. However, I must raise a few points to ensure accuracy:\n1.  **Algebraic Precision:** The relativistic calculation involves solving a quadratic equation. A simple sign error or mistake in expansion could lead to an incorrect result. The algebraic steps must be double-checked.\n2.  **Formula Integrity:** The core of the relativistic calculation is the relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`. Is this formula correct? Yes, it derives directly from `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2` and `E = T + mc^2`.\n3.  **Conservation Laws:** The application of conservation of energy (to find the total kinetic energy) and conservation of momentum (to relate the two fragments' energies) is fundamental. The assumption that momenta are equal and opposite (`|p1| = |p2|`) is correct for a decay from rest.\n4.  **Unit Conversion:** The initial data is in GeV, but the final answer options are in MeV. A final conversion step (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`) is required and must not be forgotten.\n\n**Decision:** The proposer's plan is sound, and the skeptic's concerns are valid checks on the execution rather than flaws in the plan itself. The next and only action is to perform the detailed calculation.\n\n***\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Determine Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Let the rest-mass energies of the fragments be `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n    *   We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Substituting `m1 = 2*m2`: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`.\n    *   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   The more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of 198 GeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n    *   The energy released is the loss in rest mass: `Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1_rel):**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`.\n    *   Using the relativistic relation `(pc)^2 = T(T + 2mc^2)`:\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)`\n    *   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198`, and `m2*c^2 = 99` (all in GeV):\n        `T1 * (T1 + 2*198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2*99)`\n        `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n        `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2`\n        `600*T1 = 603`\n        `T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_class):**\n    *   In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n    *   Since `p1 = p2`, the ratio of kinetic energies is `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n    *   `T1 / T2 = 99 GeV / 198 GeV = 1/2`, which means `T2 = 2*T1`.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV` => `3*T1 = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T1_class = 1 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   Difference = `T1_rel - T1_class = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n    *   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
