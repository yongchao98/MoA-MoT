  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe search results confirm the key assumptions made in the logical deduction.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2):** It decomposes into nitrogen gas (N2) and water (H2O). The reaction is NH4NO2 → N2 + 2H2O.\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3):** At temperatures around 200-260°C, it primarily decomposes into nitrous oxide (N2O) and water (H2O). The reaction is NH4NO3 → N2O + 2H2O.\n*   **Reaction with Hot Copper:** Nitrous oxide (N2O) reacts with red-hot copper, where the copper is oxidized to copper oxide (CuO) and N2O is reduced to nitrogen gas (N2). The reaction is Cu + N2O → CuO + N2.\n\nThe initial analysis was correct. The mixture consists of ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. The decomposition produced N2 and H2O from the ammonium nitrite, and N2O and H2O from the ammonium nitrate. The N2O then reacted with the hot copper, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of the oxygen atom and producing more N2.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation based on this chemical model was:\n1.  Calculate moles of products from experimental data: 0.2 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n2.  Hypothesize the salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3.\n3.  Set up the decomposition equations for an equimolar mixture (x moles of each):\n    *   x NH4NO2 → x N2 + 2x H2O\n    *   x NH4NO3 → x N2O + 2x H2O\n4.  Compare the predicted products (x mol N2, x mol N2O, 4x mol H2O) with the calculated products.\n    *   x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This fits all product quantities.\n5.  Verify the total mass with x = 0.05 mol for each salt.\n    *   Mass = 0.05 * M(NH4NO2) + 0.05 * M(NH4NO3) = 7.20 g. This was also correct.\n6.  The final step is to count the atoms in the two salt formulas.\n    *   Salt A: NH4NO2 -> N(2) + H(4) + O(2) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B: NH4NO3 -> N(2) + H(4) + O(3) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe entire logical chain is sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal Answer is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g is due to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This indicates the absence of carbonate or oxalate groups in the original salts.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed. The weight increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a gas that did not react with any of the previous substances were collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given the starting materials are likely nitrogen-containing salts (a common theme in such chemistry problems) and the gas is inert to the reagents, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Formulate a hypothesis for the salts and their reactions:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen in the products strongly suggests that the original salts are ammonium salts. The presence of nitrogen and oxygen suggests nitrate (NO₃⁻) or nitrite (NO₂⁻) anions.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**. Their thermal decomposition reactions can produce the observed gases:\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** A known decomposition pathway at temperatures around 200-260°C is:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** This salt is unstable and readily decomposes upon heating:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n**3. Test the hypothesis with the experimental data:**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of Salt A and Salt B.\n\n*   From the decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   Moles of N₂ = x\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.5x\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2x\n*   From the decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = x\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2x\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5x\n*   **Total Moles of N₂ (Gas C):** x + x = 2x\n\nWe can now solve for 'x' using the moles calculated from the experimental results:\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 0.2 mol  =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol => **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: 2x = 0.1 mol   =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n\nAll three calculations yield a consistent value for x, which strongly supports our hypothesis.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass:**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 moles of each salt equals the given 7.20 g.\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n*   Mass of Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Mass of Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   **Total Mass** = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the given total weight of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8**\n\n**Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of Gas C and the Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial mixture of salts (7.20 g) completely decomposed into gases. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass.\n\n*   Total mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nThe gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g sample:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe original mixture contained H, N, and O. The problem states it's a mixture of salts. This suggests ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids (like nitrate or nitrite).\n\nLet's find the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in the entire sample:\n*   N : H : O\n*   0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nDivide by the smallest number (0.20):\n*   1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\n*   4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe overall empirical formula for the combined salts is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the formula N₄H₈O₅ represents the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n(Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nLet's try to split this into two common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃, which has the formula N₂H₄O₃.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂, which has the formula N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's check if these two salts add up to our overall formula:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B was heated, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases. This gaseous mixture was then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing anions like carbonate (CO₃²⁻).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Red-hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. In this context, it reacts with oxygen (O₂). The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that the products include H₂O and O₂, the original salts likely contained H, O, and N. Therefore, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\nWe know the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. The combined empirical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is H₈N₄O₅. Since the salts are composed of H, N, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\nLet's test common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's sum the formulas of these two salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio we derived. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification with stoichiometry and mass.**\nThe mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  (or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n\nLet's calculate the expected moles of products from 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   Total H₂O = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 2 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 2 = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 1 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 1 = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n(from NH₄NO₃) × 0.5 = 0.5n\n\nUsing our experimental values:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our hypothesis.\n\nFinally, let's check the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user wants me to solve a chemistry problem. I have already performed the reasoning and generated a Python script to verify the calculations. The script's output confirms my manual reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Products and Moles:**\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g in the hot copper tube corresponds to 0.80 g of O₂. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP is an inert gas, identified as N₂. Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The absence of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube means no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n\n2.  **Verify with Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂)\n    *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming the products and their quantities are correct.\n\n3.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Mixture:**\n    *   Moles of H = 2 * moles(H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 * moles(N₂) = 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O = 1 * moles(H₂O) + 2 * moles(O₂) = 0.20 + 2 * 0.025 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 gives an integer ratio of 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n4.  **Deduce Salt Formulas:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so it contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The elements (N, H, O) suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), one for each salt, account for N₂H₈.\n    *   The remaining atoms for the two anions are (N₄H₈O₅) - (N₂H₈) = N₂O₅.\n    *   The two anions that sum to N₂O₅ are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the salts are A = NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) and B = NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate).\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe code output confirms these calculations, showing a total of 17 atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the products based on the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases by removing oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   The gas responsible is likely nitrous oxide (N₂O), via the reaction: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This means 0.05 mol of N₂O was present.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at STP remains. This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the original salts:**\n    *   The products are H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. This points to the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts.\n    *   The relevant decomposition reactions are:\n        *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Let's assume the equimolar mixture consists of 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃ (Salt A) and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ (Salt B).\n    *   From the decomposition, we would get:\n        *   n moles of N₂O (from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   n moles of N₂ (from NH₄NO₂)\n        *   2n + 2n = 4n moles of H₂O (from both)\n\n3.  **Verify the hypothesis with the data:**\n    *   **N₂O:** The 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with Cu came from 0.05 mol of N₂O. So, n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **H₂O:** The total water produced is 4n. Using n=0.05, we get 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol of H₂O. This matches our calculation from the mass increase of tube №1.\n    *   **N₂:** The final gas C is N₂. It consists of the N₂ produced directly from NH₄NO₂ (n moles) and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with Cu (n moles). Total N₂ = n + n = 2n. Using n=0.05, we get 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol of N₂. This matches our calculation for Gas C.\n    *   The hypothesis is correct.

Deduce the identities of the two equimolar salts, A and B, that would decompose to form this specific mixture of gases.\n    4.  Count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the moles of water (H₂O) absorbed, the moles of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper, and the moles of the final gas C.\n\n```python\n# Molar mass of H2O = 18.015 g/mol\n# Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n# Molar volume of a gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 22.4 L/mol\n\n# Given data from the problem\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g, corresponds to mass of H2O\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80    # g, corresponds to mass of O in CuO\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n# Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / 18.015\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_increase_tube3 / 15.999\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C / 22.4\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O = {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O atoms = {moles_O_atoms:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of gas C = {moles_gas_C:.4f} mol\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 0.1998 mol (approx. 0.20 mol)\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.0500 mol\n    *   Moles of gas C = 0.1000 mol\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  The products are ~0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The inert gas C is likely N₂.\n    2.  The oxidizing gas reacted with hot copper (`Cu + [O] -> CuO`). A common nitrogen-based oxidizing gas from decomposition is N₂O. The reaction `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO` shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been 0.05 mol.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of this produced N₂ and any N₂ present in the initial gas mixture. Therefore, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.  The initial gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂. Let's verify this by checking if the total mass equals the starting 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the deduced gas mixture (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂).\n\n```python\n# Moles of each gas component (using rounded values for clarity)\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\nmoles_N2 = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_N2O = 44.013  # 2*14.007 + 15.999\nM_N2 = 28.014   # 2*14.007\n\n# Calculate the mass of each component and the total mass\nmass_H2O = moles_H2O * M_H2O\nmass_N2O = moles_N2O * M_N2O\nmass_N2 = moles_N2 * M_N2\ntotal_mass = mass_H2O + mass_N2O + mass_N2\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Calculated total mass = 7.20 g\n    *   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n    *   The mass balance is correct, confirming the identity and amounts of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to yield 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    2.  The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`) and ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`) fit these products.\n    3.  If we have an equimolar mixture of `n` moles each, the products are `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1:4.\n    4.  Our experimental results (0.05 mol N₂O : 0.05 mol N₂ : 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match the 1:1:4 ratio, with `n = 0.05` mol.\n    5.  Thus, the salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂. The final step is to count the atoms in their formulas.\n\n*   **Action:** Count the total number of atoms in the formulas NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate: NH4NO3\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite: NH4NO2\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms in both salt formulas\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3 = {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2 = {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 9\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 8\n    *   Total atoms = 17\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The logical deduction confirmed that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).

Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\n*   The mixture of gases from the decomposition is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ to form a precipitate (calcium carbonate), which would increase the tube's weight. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form black copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, measuring 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), is inert to the previous reagents. This volume corresponds to a specific number of moles.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product**\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   Mass = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Given that the original salts are nitrogen-based (a common feature of salts that decompose into gases), Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Identify the Salts Based on Decomposition Products**\n\nWe need to find two nitrogen-containing salts that, when decomposed in an equimolar ratio, produce 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's consider common ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   Reaction: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it typically produces N₂O and H₂O. However, a different decomposition pathway can occur, especially under certain conditions, that yields nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   Reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n**4. Verify the Molar Ratios and Mass**\n\nLet's assume the mixture contains 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃). Based on the stoichiometry of their decomposition reactions:\n\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₂**: Produces **x mol of N₂** and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₃**: Produces **x mol of N₂**, **(x/2) mol of O₂**, and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total N₂:** x + x = 2x\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** x/2\n\nFrom our initial calculations, we know:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol\n\nLet's solve for 'x' using the products:\n*   2x = 0.1 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n*   4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol (This matches the H₂O produced)\n*   x/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (This matches the O₂ produced)\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nLet's check if the total mass matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17 atoms**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### **1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nFirst, we identify the gaseous products and their quantities based on the experimental results.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ or NO₂ were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) did not react with any of the previous substances. This indicates an inert gas.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given that the original substances are salts likely containing nitrogen, the inert gas C is most probably nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition produced water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and nitrogen (N₂). This means the original salts must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Since they are salts, a logical assumption is that they are ammonium salts with nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\nThe two most common salts fitting this description are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nLet's examine their thermal decomposition reactions:\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can vary with temperature. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, under strong heating, it can decompose according to the reaction: **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)**. This reaction pathway fits the observed products (N₂, O₂, and H₂O).\n\n### **3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles for both salt A (NH₄NO₂) and salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   The total mass is 7.20 g.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\nx * (64.04 g/mol) + x * (80.04 g/mol) = 7.20 g\nx * (144.08) = 7.20\nx = 7.20 / 144.08 ≈ 0.05 mol\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected amount of products:\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = (2/2) * 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = (1/2) * 0.05 = 0.025 mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = (4/2) * 0.05 = 0.1 mol\n\n**Total products:**\n*   **Total N₂:** 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Matches the 2.24 L of Gas C).\n*   **Total H₂O:** 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol (Mass = 0.2 mol * 18.02 g/mol ≈ 3.60 g. Matches the result from tube №1).\n*   **Total O₂:** 0.025 mol (Mass = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g. Matches the result from tube №3).\n\nThe calculations confirm that salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### **4. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure - STP) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This inert gas, in the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the initial salts based on the products:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based acids. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At high temperatures (the problem states 200°C), one of its decomposition pathways produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis set of reactions produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O, matching the experimental results.\n\n**3. Use stoichiometry to verify the salt identities:**\n\nLet's assume the initial equimolar mixture contained `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ (from the 2:2 ratio), `0.5x` moles of O₂ (from the 2:1 ratio), and `2x` moles of H₂O (from the 2:4 ratio).\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\n**Now, let's use the moles calculated from the experimental data:**\n*   From O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: `4x` = 0.2 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: `2x` = 0.1 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of `x` = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming that the mixture was 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass:**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol = 4.0025 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the decomposition products based on the experimental data.**\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B (7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂, NO₂) were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, meaning the gas contained oxygen atoms.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not H₂O (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (no reaction in tube 2). A common product from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the gases and deduce the decomposition reactions.**\nLet's verify the identity of the gases by checking the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the initial gas mixture must be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   The gas that reacted with copper was N₂O. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g.\n*   The remaining gas C is N₂. Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(N₂O) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 2.80 g = 8.60 g. This does not match the initial 7.20 g.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the composition of Gas C.\nThe total mass of the initial gas mixture is 7.20 g.\nThe mass of H₂O absorbed is 3.60 g.\nThe mass of O absorbed by Cu is 0.80 g.\nThe mass of the remaining gas C must be the initial mass minus the mass of the components removed:\nMass of Gas C = 7.20 g - (Mass of H₂O + Mass of the gas that reacted with Cu).\nThe gas that reacted with Cu was N₂O. The mass of N₂O is not just the mass of oxygen. Mass N₂O = Moles N₂O * Molar Mass N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44 g/mol = 2.20 g.\nSo, the mass of the gas mixture before Tube 3 was 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) = 3.60 g.\nThis 3.60 g mixture contained N₂O and the gas that would become Gas C.\nAfter Tube 3, 2.20 g of N₂O reacted, leaving 3.60 g - 2.20 g = 1.40 g of gas.\nThis remaining gas is Gas C. So, Mass of Gas C = 1.40 g.\nWe know Moles of Gas C = 0.10 mol.\nMolar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 1.40 g / 0.10 mol = 14.0 g/mol. This is not a stable molecule.\n\nLet's reconsider the source of Gas C. Gas C is the final gas remaining. It is composed of any inert gas from the initial decomposition PLUS any inert gas formed in the tubes.\n*   Reaction in Tube 3: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n*   We determined that 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted. This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final volume of Gas C is 0.10 mol. This final gas is N₂.\n*   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction)\n*   0.10 mol = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + 0.05 mol\n*   Therefore, N₂ (from initial decomposition) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the initial decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\nThe salts must contain N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions are oxides of nitrogen (NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's look at their decomposition reactions at ~200°C.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume we have 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₂, we get n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₃, we get n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThese values match perfectly. So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (Salt A) and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (Salt B).\n\n**Step 4: Verify the initial mass.**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem is solved by identifying the products of the thermal decomposition and using them to deduce the composition of the original salts.\n\n1.  **Identify the Decomposition Products:**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) shows no weight change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n    *   Tube №3 (red-hot copper) absorbs oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP, which is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition:**\n    *   From the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol\n        *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol\n    *   The presence of only N, H, and O suggests the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts (A and B):**\n    *   The salts are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume the mixture contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The likely candidates that decompose to N₂, H₂O, and O₂ are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis with their decomposition reactions:\n        *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or simplified: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n    *   From 'n' moles of each salt, the total moles of products would be:\n        *   Total N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5n (from B) = 0.5n\n    *   Using the moles of products calculated in step 1:\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n      => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n    => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   The consistent value of n = 0.05 mol confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n4.  **Count the Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₂. The number of atoms is 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₃. The number of atoms is 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts, weighing 7.20 g, was heated and decomposed completely into a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition. This indicates the absence of carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products (Water + Oxygen + Gas C) must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). Therefore, the decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n### 2. Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe elements present in the products are Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). This means the original salts A and B must be composed of these elements. Given they are salts, a likely cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions would be nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions). The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture consists of Salt A = Ammonium Nitrite and Salt B = Ammonium Nitrate.\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\nFrom the decomposition of 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃)\n\nUsing the moles calculated from the experimental data:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Checking with N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental result.\n*   Checking with H₂O: 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This also matches the experimental result.\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent across all products, confirming that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit.\n*   Total Atoms = Atoms in Salt A + Atoms in Salt B = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe python code successfully identified the gaseous products and their molar quantities from the experimental data. The products are 0.200 mol of water (H₂O), 0.025 mol of oxygen (O₂), and 0.100 mol of nitrogen (N₂). The total mass of these products is 7.20 g, confirming the law of conservation of mass.\n\nBased on these products, the code correctly deduced that the two salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The decomposition reactions are:\nSalt A: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\nSalt B: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe code correctly determined that the initial equimolar mixture contained 0.05 mol of each salt. A minor typo (`predicted_mles_n2` instead of `predicted_moles_n2`) caused a `NameError`, but all the necessary calculations to identify the salts and their quantities were completed successfully before this point.\n\nThe final step is to count the atoms in one formula unit of each salt:\n-   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n-   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by understanding the function of each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) in the gas mixture. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas)**\n    *   The gas that remains after passing through all three tubes does not react with water absorbers, acidic gas detectors, or hot copper. It is an inert gas.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the identified gaseous products (H₂O and O₂) and see what the mass of Gas C must be.\n*   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of approximately 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This fits perfectly.\n\nSo, the decomposition of salts A and B produced:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Salt Mixture**\n\nThe original salts must contain the elements that make up the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's find the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ * (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O * 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 2 mol O/mol O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply all by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture of (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\nLet's try to split the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\nThe presence of 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggests two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\nIf we use two NH₄⁺ cations, the remaining atoms are N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\nThe total charge of two NH₄⁺ ions is +2. Therefore, the N₂O₅ portion must form anions with a total charge of -2.\nThe most common nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\nLet's see if they fit:\n*   Anion 1: NO₃⁻\n*   Anion 2: NO₂⁻\nThe combination of these two anions is (NO₃ + NO₂) = N₂O₅, and their total charge is (-1) + (-1) = -2. This perfectly balances the two NH₄⁺ cations.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n\nLet's verify this with the known decomposition reactions around 200-250°C:\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂, n/2 moles of O₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow, we match this with our findings from step 1:\n*   Moles of O₂ = n/2 = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Using this n, we check the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\nThe value n=0.05 mol is consistent.\n\nFinally, let's check the initial mass:\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.04 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.04 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g (Matches)\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify two salts, A and B, based on their decomposition products. The first step is to analyze the information from the three tubes and the remaining gas to determine the chemical composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. However, we must be careful with our assumptions. The identity of gas C is not explicitly given, and the decomposition reactions of the initial salts can be complex and temperature-dependent. We need to ensure our deductions are consistent across all given data points (mass changes, gas volume, etc.).\n\nProposer: I will start by calculating the moles of the substances absorbed or reacted in each tube and the moles of the final gas C. This is a direct calculation from the data provided and involves no assumptions yet.\n\nProposer:\nBased on the search results and chemical principles, I can now determine the products of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube's weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The gas passing through would be molecular oxygen (O₂). The molar mass of an oxygen atom is ~16.00 g/mol, so the molar mass of O₂ is ~32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Gas C:** This is the remaining gas. Its volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\nNow, I will determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass. The total initial mass was 7.20 g. By conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this series of reactions is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\nMy next step is to determine the empirical formula of the initial salt mixture from these products and then deduce the formulas of salts A and B.\n\nSkeptic:\nYour analysis of the products seems sound. The identification of Gas C as N₂ is well-supported. The crucial step is now identifying the two initial salts. You have the total elemental composition of the mixture (N, H, O), but you need to partition it into two distinct, equimolar salts that are chemically plausible. The decomposition reactions you will need to assume must also be plausible for the given conditions.\n\nProposer:\nI will now determine the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original mixture. From there, I will deduce the formulas of the two equimolar salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O -> 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ -> 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O + 0.025 mol O₂ -> (0.20 * 1) + (0.025 * 2) = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe initial mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture, let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total moles of N are 0.20, so 2n * (average N atoms per salt) = 0.20.\n\nLet's consider the simplest case where the total moles of salts are 0.10 mol (0.05 mol A + 0.05 mol B).\nThis would mean the total formula of the mixture (A+B) contains:\n*   N: 0.20 mol / 0.05 = 4\n*   H: 0.40 mol / 0.05 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 mol / 0.05 = 5\nSo, the combined formula is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salts. Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts. The NH₄⁺ ion accounts for NH₄.\n*   If we have two ammonium salts, we use 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   The two most common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅.\n\nThis fits perfectly. So, the salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)\n*   **Salt B:** NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe molar ratio of products from these reactions (N₂ : O₂ : H₂O) is (1+1) : (1/2) : (2+2) for every 1 mole of B and 1 mole of A (in the 2NH4NO3 form), which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nOur experimental molar ratio is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20, which also simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. The hypothesis is consistent.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nSkeptic:\nThe logic is consistent and all data points are accounted for.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas provided oxygen atoms. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The most likely oxidizing gas produced from the decomposition of a nitrogen-containing salt at 200°C is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O in the gas mixture was 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all previous reagents. The reaction in Tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produced 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C is this N₂ plus any N₂ produced in the initial decomposition.\n    *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ (initial) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (initial) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**Summary of Initial Decomposition Products:**\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**2. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) indicate the original salts contained N, H, and O. The most common salts that produce these specific gases upon heating are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite Decomposition:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate Decomposition (at ~200°C):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contained 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we expect 'n' moles of N₂ and '2n' moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we expect 'n' moles of N₂O and '2n' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles of N₂O = n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n. Let's check: 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe results match perfectly. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's confirm that the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the initial mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe search results confirm the key assumptions made in the logical deduction.\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2):** It decomposes into nitrogen gas (N2) and water (H2O). The reaction is NH4NO2 → N2 + 2H2O.\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3):** At temperatures around 200-260°C, it primarily decomposes into nitrous oxide (N2O) and water (H2O). The reaction is NH4NO3 → N2O + 2H2O.\n*   **Reaction with Hot Copper:** Nitrous oxide (N2O) reacts with red-hot copper, where the copper is oxidized to copper oxide (CuO) and N2O is reduced to nitrogen gas (N2). The reaction is Cu + N2O → CuO + N2.\n\nThe initial analysis was correct. The mixture consists of ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. The decomposition produced N2 and H2O from the ammonium nitrite, and N2O and H2O from the ammonium nitrate. The N2O then reacted with the hot copper, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of the oxygen atom and producing more N2.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation based on this chemical model was:\n1.  Calculate moles of products from experimental data: 0.2 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n2.  Hypothesize the salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3.\n3.  Set up the decomposition equations for an equimolar mixture (x moles of each):\n    *   x NH4NO2 → x N2 + 2x H2O\n    *   x NH4NO3 → x N2O + 2x H2O\n4.  Compare the predicted products (x mol N2, x mol N2O, 4x mol H2O) with the calculated products.\n    *   x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This fits all product quantities.\n5.  Verify the total mass with x = 0.05 mol for each salt.\n    *   Mass = 0.05 * M(NH4NO2) + 0.05 * M(NH4NO3) = 7.20 g. This was also correct.\n6.  The final step is to count the atoms in the two salt formulas.\n    *   Salt A: NH4NO2 -> N(2) + H(4) + O(2) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B: NH4NO3 -> N(2) + H(4) + O(3) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe entire logical chain is sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal Answer is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g is due to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no CO₂ was produced. This indicates the absence of carbonate or oxalate groups in the original salts.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO is formed. The weight increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a gas that did not react with any of the previous substances were collected at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given the starting materials are likely nitrogen-containing salts (a common theme in such chemistry problems) and the gas is inert to the reagents, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Formulate a hypothesis for the salts and their reactions:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen in the products strongly suggests that the original salts are ammonium salts. The presence of nitrogen and oxygen suggests nitrate (NO₃⁻) or nitrite (NO₂⁻) anions.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**. Their thermal decomposition reactions can produce the observed gases:\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** A known decomposition pathway at temperatures around 200-260°C is:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** This salt is unstable and readily decomposes upon heating:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\n**3. Test the hypothesis with the experimental data:**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles of Salt A and Salt B.\n\n*   From the decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   Moles of N₂ = x\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.5x\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2x\n*   From the decomposition of 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = x\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2x\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5x\n*   **Total Moles of N₂ (Gas C):** x + x = 2x\n\nWe can now solve for 'x' using the moles calculated from the experimental results:\n*   From H₂O: 4x = 0.2 mol  =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   From O₂: 0.5x = 0.025 mol => **x = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: 2x = 0.1 mol   =>  **x = 0.05 mol**\n\nAll three calculations yield a consistent value for x, which strongly supports our hypothesis.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass:**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 moles of each salt equals the given 7.20 g.\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol\n*   Mass of Salt A (NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol = 4.003 g\n*   Mass of Salt B (NH₄NO₂) = 0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol = 3.203 g\n*   **Total Mass** = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g\n\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the given total weight of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8**\n\n**Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of Gas C and the Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial mixture of salts (7.20 g) completely decomposed into gases. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass.\n\n*   Total mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nThe gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g sample:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe original mixture contained H, N, and O. The problem states it's a mixture of salts. This suggests ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids (like nitrate or nitrite).\n\nLet's find the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in the entire sample:\n*   N : H : O\n*   0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nDivide by the smallest number (0.20):\n*   1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\n*   4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe overall empirical formula for the combined salts is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the formula N₄H₈O₅ represents the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n(Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nLet's try to split this into two common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃, which has the formula N₂H₄O₃.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂, which has the formula N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's check if these two salts add up to our overall formula:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B was heated, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases. This gaseous mixture was then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing anions like carbonate (CO₃²⁻).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Red-hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. In this context, it reacts with oxygen (O₂). The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that the products include H₂O and O₂, the original salts likely contained H, O, and N. Therefore, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\nWe know the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. The combined empirical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is H₈N₄O₅. Since the salts are composed of H, N, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\nLet's test common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's sum the formulas of these two salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio we derived. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification with stoichiometry and mass.**\nThe mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  (or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n\nLet's calculate the expected moles of products from 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   Total H₂O = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 2 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 2 = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 1 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 1 = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n(from NH₄NO₃) × 0.5 = 0.5n\n\nUsing our experimental values:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our hypothesis.\n\nFinally, let's check the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe user wants me to solve a chemistry problem. I have already performed the reasoning and generated a Python script to verify the calculations. The script's output confirms my manual reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Products and Moles:**\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g in the hot copper tube corresponds to 0.80 g of O₂. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP is an inert gas, identified as N₂. Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The absence of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube means no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n\n2.  **Verify with Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂)\n    *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming the products and their quantities are correct.\n\n3.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Mixture:**\n    *   Moles of H = 2 * moles(H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 * moles(N₂) = 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O = 1 * moles(H₂O) + 2 * moles(O₂) = 0.20 + 2 * 0.025 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 gives an integer ratio of 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n4.  **Deduce Salt Formulas:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so it contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The elements (N, H, O) suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), one for each salt, account for N₂H₈.\n    *   The remaining atoms for the two anions are (N₄H₈O₅) - (N₂H₈) = N₂O₅.\n    *   The two anions that sum to N₂O₅ are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the salts are A = NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) and B = NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate).\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe code output confirms these calculations, showing a total of 17 atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAn equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 15\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 17\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the products based on the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases by removing oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   The gas responsible is likely nitrous oxide (N₂O), via the reaction: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This means 0.05 mol of N₂O was present.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at STP remains. This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the original salts:**\n    *   The products are H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. This points to the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts.\n    *   The relevant decomposition reactions are:\n        *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Let's assume the equimolar mixture consists of 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃ (Salt A) and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ (Salt B).\n    *   From the decomposition, we would get:\n        *   n moles of N₂O (from NH₄NO₃)\n        *   n moles of N₂ (from NH₄NO₂)\n        *   2n + 2n = 4n moles of H₂O (from both)\n\n3.  **Verify the hypothesis with the data:**\n    *   **N₂O:** The 0.05 mol of O atoms that reacted with Cu came from 0.05 mol of N₂O. So, n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **H₂O:** The total water produced is 4n. Using n=0.05, we get 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol of H₂O. This matches our calculation from the mass increase of tube №1.\n    *   **N₂:** The final gas C is N₂. It consists of the N₂ produced directly from NH₄NO₂ (n moles) and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with Cu (n moles). Total N₂ = n + n = 2n. Using n=0.05, we get 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol of N₂. This matches our calculation for Gas C.\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. The salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

The products are ~0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The inert gas C is likely N₂.\n    2.  The oxidizing gas reacted with hot copper (`Cu + [O] -> CuO`). A common nitrogen-based oxidizing gas from decomposition is N₂O. The reaction `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO` shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been 0.05 mol.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of this produced N₂ and any N₂ present in the initial gas mixture. Therefore, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.  The initial gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂. Let's verify this by checking if the total mass equals the starting 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the deduced gas mixture (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂).\n\n```python\n# Moles of each gas component (using rounded values for clarity)\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\nmoles_N2 = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_N2O = 44.013  # 2*14.007 + 15.999\nM_N2 = 28.014   # 2*14.007\n\n# Calculate the mass of each component and the total mass\nmass_H2O = moles_H2O * M_H2O\nmass_N2O = moles_N2O * M_N2O\nmass_N2 = moles_N2 * M_N2\ntotal_mass = mass_H2O + mass_N2O + mass_N2\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Calculated total mass = 7.20 g\n    *   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n    *   The mass balance is correct, confirming the identity and amounts of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to yield 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    2.  The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`) and ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`) fit these products.\n    3.  If we have an equimolar mixture of `n` moles each, the products are `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1:4.\n    4.  Our experimental results (0.05 mol N₂O : 0.05 mol N₂ : 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match the 1:1:4 ratio, with `n = 0.05` mol.\n    5.  Thus, the salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂. The final step is to count the atoms in their formulas.\n\n*   **Action:** Count the total number of atoms in the formulas NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate: NH4NO3\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite: NH4NO2\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms in both salt formulas\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3 = {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2 = {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 9\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 8\n    *   Total atoms = 17\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The logical deduction confirmed that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).

Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\n*   The mixture of gases from the decomposition is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ to form a precipitate (calcium carbonate), which would increase the tube's weight. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form black copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, measuring 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), is inert to the previous reagents. This volume corresponds to a specific number of moles.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product**\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   Mass = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Given that the original salts are nitrogen-based (a common feature of salts that decompose into gases), Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Identify the Salts Based on Decomposition Products**\n\nWe need to find two nitrogen-containing salts that, when decomposed in an equimolar ratio, produce 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's consider common ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   Reaction: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it typically produces N₂O and H₂O. However, a different decomposition pathway can occur, especially under certain conditions, that yields nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   Reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n**4. Verify the Molar Ratios and Mass**\n\nLet's assume the mixture contains 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃). Based on the stoichiometry of their decomposition reactions:\n\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₂**: Produces **x mol of N₂** and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₃**: Produces **x mol of N₂**, **(x/2) mol of O₂**, and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total N₂:** x + x = 2x\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** x/2\n\nFrom our initial calculations, we know:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol\n\nLet's solve for 'x' using the products:\n*   2x = 0.1 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n*   4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol (This matches the H₂O produced)\n*   x/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (This matches the O₂ produced)\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nLet's check if the total mass matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture.\n\n**5.

Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\nFirst, we identify the gaseous products and their quantities based on the experimental results.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases like CO₂ or NO₂ were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) did not react with any of the previous substances. This indicates an inert gas.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given that the original substances are salts likely containing nitrogen, the inert gas C is most probably nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe decomposition produced water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and nitrogen (N₂). This means the original salts must be composed of Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Since they are salts, a logical assumption is that they are ammonium salts with nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\nThe two most common salts fitting this description are:\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n\nLet's examine their thermal decomposition reactions:\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrite is: **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can vary with temperature. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, under strong heating, it can decompose according to the reaction: **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)**. This reaction pathway fits the observed products (N₂, O₂, and H₂O).\n\n### **3. Stoichiometric Verification**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was equimolar. Let 'x' be the number of moles for both salt A (NH₄NO₂) and salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   The total mass is 7.20 g.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\nx * (64.04 g/mol) + x * (80.04 g/mol) = 7.20 g\nx * (144.08) = 7.20\nx = 7.20 / 144.08 ≈ 0.05 mol\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected amount of products:\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol\n*   **From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = (2/2) * 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = (1/2) * 0.05 = 0.025 mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = (4/2) * 0.05 = 0.1 mol\n\n**Total products:**\n*   **Total N₂:** 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Matches the 2.24 L of Gas C).\n*   **Total H₂O:** 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol (Mass = 0.2 mol * 18.02 g/mol ≈ 3.60 g. Matches the result from tube №1).\n*   **Total O₂:** 0.025 mol (Mass = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g. Matches the result from tube №3).\n\nThe calculations confirm that salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### **4. Calculation of Total Atoms**\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure - STP) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This inert gas, in the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the initial salts based on the products:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based acids. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At high temperatures (the problem states 200°C), one of its decomposition pathways produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis set of reactions produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O, matching the experimental results.\n\n**3. Use stoichiometry to verify the salt identities:**\n\nLet's assume the initial equimolar mixture contained `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ (from the 2:2 ratio), `0.5x` moles of O₂ (from the 2:1 ratio), and `2x` moles of H₂O (from the 2:4 ratio).\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\n**Now, let's use the moles calculated from the experimental data:**\n*   From O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: `4x` = 0.2 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: `2x` = 0.1 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of `x` = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming that the mixture was 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass:**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol = 4.0025 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the decomposition products based on the experimental data.**\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B (7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a strong dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no CO₂ or other acidic gases (like SO₂, NO₂) were present in the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, meaning the gas contained oxygen atoms.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that reacted must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not H₂O (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (no reaction in tube 2). A common product from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction would be N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the gases and deduce the decomposition reactions.**\nLet's verify the identity of the gases by checking the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the initial gas mixture must be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   The gas that reacted with copper was N₂O. Moles of N₂O = 0.05 mol. Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g.\n*   The remaining gas C is N₂. Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(N₂O) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 2.80 g = 8.60 g. This does not match the initial 7.20 g.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the composition of Gas C.\nThe total mass of the initial gas mixture is 7.20 g.\nThe mass of H₂O absorbed is 3.60 g.\nThe mass of O absorbed by Cu is 0.80 g.\nThe mass of the remaining gas C must be the initial mass minus the mass of the components removed:\nMass of Gas C = 7.20 g - (Mass of H₂O + Mass of the gas that reacted with Cu).\nThe gas that reacted with Cu was N₂O. The mass of N₂O is not just the mass of oxygen. Mass N₂O = Moles N₂O * Molar Mass N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44 g/mol = 2.20 g.\nSo, the mass of the gas mixture before Tube 3 was 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) = 3.60 g.\nThis 3.60 g mixture contained N₂O and the gas that would become Gas C.\nAfter Tube 3, 2.20 g of N₂O reacted, leaving 3.60 g - 2.20 g = 1.40 g of gas.\nThis remaining gas is Gas C. So, Mass of Gas C = 1.40 g.\nWe know Moles of Gas C = 0.10 mol.\nMolar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 1.40 g / 0.10 mol = 14.0 g/mol. This is not a stable molecule.\n\nLet's reconsider the source of Gas C. Gas C is the final gas remaining. It is composed of any inert gas from the initial decomposition PLUS any inert gas formed in the tubes.\n*   Reaction in Tube 3: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n*   We determined that 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted. This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final volume of Gas C is 0.10 mol. This final gas is N₂.\n*   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction)\n*   0.10 mol = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + 0.05 mol\n*   Therefore, N₂ (from initial decomposition) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the initial decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**Step 3: Identify salts A and B.**\nThe salts must contain N, H, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions are oxides of nitrogen (NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻). Let's look at their decomposition reactions at ~200°C.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume we have 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₂, we get n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From n moles of NH₄NO₃, we get n moles of N₂O and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of N₂O = n = 0.05 mol\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThese values match perfectly. So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ (Salt A) and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ (Salt B).\n\n**Step 4: Verify the initial mass.**\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formula units of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A: NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B: NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe problem is solved by identifying the products of the thermal decomposition and using them to deduce the composition of the original salts.\n\n1.  **Identify the Decomposition Products:**\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂) absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) shows no weight change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n    *   Tube №3 (red-hot copper) absorbs oxygen. The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP, which is 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the Elemental Composition:**\n    *   From the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 = 0.40 mol\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 = 0.20 mol\n        *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol\n    *   The presence of only N, H, and O suggests the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen-oxygen anions.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts (A and B):**\n    *   The salts are in an equimolar mixture. Let's assume the mixture contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The likely candidates that decompose to N₂, H₂O, and O₂ are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis with their decomposition reactions:\n        *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or simplified: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n    *   From 'n' moles of each salt, the total moles of products would be:\n        *   Total N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n        *   Total H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n\n        *   Total O₂ = 0 (from A) + 0.5n (from B) = 0.5n\n    *   Using the moles of products calculated in step 1:\n        *   From O₂: 0.025 mol = 0.5n  => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From N₂: 0.10 mol = 2n      => n = 0.05 mol\n        *   From H₂O: 0.20 mol = 4n    => n = 0.05 mol\n    *   The consistent value of n = 0.05 mol confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n4.  **Count the Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₂. The number of atoms is 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₃. The number of atoms is 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts, weighing 7.20 g, was heated and decomposed completely into a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition. This indicates the absence of carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products (Water + Oxygen + Gas C) must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). Therefore, the decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n### 2. Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe elements present in the products are Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). This means the original salts A and B must be composed of these elements. Given they are salts, a likely cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions would be nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions). The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture consists of Salt A = Ammonium Nitrite and Salt B = Ammonium Nitrate.\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\nFrom the decomposition of 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃)\n\nUsing the moles calculated from the experimental data:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Checking with N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental result.\n*   Checking with H₂O: 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This also matches the experimental result.\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent across all products, confirming that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit.\n*   Total Atoms = Atoms in Salt A + Atoms in Salt B = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe python code successfully identified the gaseous products and their molar quantities from the experimental data. The products are 0.200 mol of water (H₂O), 0.025 mol of oxygen (O₂), and 0.100 mol of nitrogen (N₂). The total mass of these products is 7.20 g, confirming the law of conservation of mass.\n\nBased on these products, the code correctly deduced that the two salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The decomposition reactions are:\nSalt A: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\nSalt B: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nThe code correctly determined that the initial equimolar mixture contained 0.05 mol of each salt. A minor typo (`predicted_mles_n2` instead of `predicted_moles_n2`) caused a `NameError`, but all the necessary calculations to identify the salts and their quantities were completed successfully before this point.\n\nThe final step is to count the atoms in one formula unit of each salt:\n-   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms\n-   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by understanding the function of each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) in the gas mixture. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas)**\n    *   The gas that remains after passing through all three tubes does not react with water absorbers, acidic gas detectors, or hot copper. It is an inert gas.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the identified gaseous products (H₂O and O₂) and see what the mass of Gas C must be.\n*   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of approximately 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This fits perfectly.\n\nSo, the decomposition of salts A and B produced:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Salt Mixture**\n\nThe original salts must contain the elements that make up the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's find the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ * (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O * 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 2 mol O/mol O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply all by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture of (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\nLet's try to split the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\nThe presence of 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggests two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\nIf we use two NH₄⁺ cations, the remaining atoms are N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\nThe total charge of two NH₄⁺ ions is +2. Therefore, the N₂O₅ portion must form anions with a total charge of -2.\nThe most common nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\nLet's see if they fit:\n*   Anion 1: NO₃⁻\n*   Anion 2: NO₂⁻\nThe combination of these two anions is (NO₃ + NO₂) = N₂O₅, and their total charge is (-1) + (-1) = -2. This perfectly balances the two NH₄⁺ cations.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n\nLet's verify this with the known decomposition reactions around 200-250°C:\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂, n/2 moles of O₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow, we match this with our findings from step 1:\n*   Moles of O₂ = n/2 = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Using this n, we check the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\nThe value n=0.05 mol is consistent.\n\nFinally, let's check the initial mass:\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.04 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.04 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g (Matches)\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify two salts, A and B, based on their decomposition products. The first step is to analyze the information from the three tubes and the remaining gas to determine the chemical composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. However, we must be careful with our assumptions. The identity of gas C is not explicitly given, and the decomposition reactions of the initial salts can be complex and temperature-dependent. We need to ensure our deductions are consistent across all given data points (mass changes, gas volume, etc.).\n\nProposer: I will start by calculating the moles of the substances absorbed or reacted in each tube and the moles of the final gas C. This is a direct calculation from the data provided and involves no assumptions yet.\n\nProposer:\nBased on the search results and chemical principles, I can now determine the products of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube's weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The gas passing through would be molecular oxygen (O₂). The molar mass of an oxygen atom is ~16.00 g/mol, so the molar mass of O₂ is ~32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Gas C:** This is the remaining gas. Its volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\nNow, I will determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass. The total initial mass was 7.20 g. By conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this series of reactions is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\nMy next step is to determine the empirical formula of the initial salt mixture from these products and then deduce the formulas of salts A and B.\n\nSkeptic:\nYour analysis of the products seems sound. The identification of Gas C as N₂ is well-supported. The crucial step is now identifying the two initial salts. You have the total elemental composition of the mixture (N, H, O), but you need to partition it into two distinct, equimolar salts that are chemically plausible. The decomposition reactions you will need to assume must also be plausible for the given conditions.\n\nProposer:\nI will now determine the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original mixture. From there, I will deduce the formulas of the two equimolar salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O -> 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ -> 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O + 0.025 mol O₂ -> (0.20 * 1) + (0.025 * 2) = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe initial mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture, let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total moles of N are 0.20, so 2n * (average N atoms per salt) = 0.20.\n\nLet's consider the simplest case where the total moles of salts are 0.10 mol (0.05 mol A + 0.05 mol B).\nThis would mean the total formula of the mixture (A+B) contains:\n*   N: 0.20 mol / 0.05 = 4\n*   H: 0.40 mol / 0.05 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 mol / 0.05 = 5\nSo, the combined formula is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salts. Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts. The NH₄⁺ ion accounts for NH₄.\n*   If we have two ammonium salts, we use 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   The two most common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅.\n\nThis fits perfectly. So, the salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)\n*   **Salt B:** NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe molar ratio of products from these reactions (N₂ : O₂ : H₂O) is (1+1) : (1/2) : (2+2) for every 1 mole of B and 1 mole of A (in the 2NH4NO3 form), which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nOur experimental molar ratio is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20, which also simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. The hypothesis is consistent.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nSkeptic:\nThe logic is consistent and all data points are accounted for. The assumed decomposition of ammonium nitrate to N₂, O₂, and H₂O is non-standard at 200°C, but within the context of a stoichiometry problem where the products are clearly defined by the analytical tests, this is a required inference. The conclusion seems solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
