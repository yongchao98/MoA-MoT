Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Understand the Premise:** The question posits a hypothetical universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist. We need to determine how this would change Maxwell's equations, which are the fundamental laws of electromagnetism in our universe.

2.  **Recall the Standard Maxwell's Equations:** In their differential form, the four equations are:
    *   **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀
        *   This relates the *divergence* of the electric field (**E**) to the density of electric charge (ρ). It means electric field lines originate from and terminate on electric charges.
    *   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0
        *   This states that the *divergence* of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero. This is the precise mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.
    *   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t
        *   This relates the *curl* (or circulation) of the electric field (**E**) to a time-varying magnetic field (**B**).
    *   **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t)
        *   This relates the *curl* (or circulation) of the magnetic field (**B**) to electric currents (**J**) and a time-varying electric field (**E**).

3.  **Analyze the Impact of Magnetic Monopoles:**
    *   **Change 1: Sources for the Magnetic Field.** If magnetic monopoles exist, they would act as sources (North poles) and sinks (South poles) for the magnetic field, just as electric charges do for the electric field. This means magnetic field lines could start and end on these "magnetic charges." Therefore, the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero.
        *   The equation **∇ ⋅ B = 0** must be modified. It would become something like ∇ ⋅ **B** = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.
        *   This affects the equation related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.

    *   **Change 2: Magnetic Currents.** If magnetic monopoles exist, their movement would constitute a "magnetic current" (let's call it **J**_m). Maxwell's equations in our universe are slightly asymmetric because we have electric currents but no magnetic currents. To restore symmetry, a magnetic current should create a circulating electric field, just as an electric current (**J**) creates a circulating magnetic field.
        *   This requires adding a magnetic current term to **Faraday's Law of Induction**. The equation **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t** would be modified to something like ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - **J**_m.
        *   This affects the equation related to the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.

4.  **Evaluate the Unchanged Equations:**
    *   Gauss's Law for Electricity deals with electric charges, which are unaffected by the existence of magnetic monopoles.
    *   The Ampère-Maxwell Law deals with electric currents and changing electric fields as sources for the magnetic field. These phenomena are also unaffected.
    *   Therefore, these two equations would remain the same.

5.  **Conclusion and Option Matching:**
    *   The two equations that would change are:
        1.  Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**).
        2.  Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the **circulation of the electric field**).
    *   Now, let's match this conclusion with the given options:
        *   A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. (Incomplete, as two equations change).
        *   B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. (This perfectly matches our analysis).
        *   C) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. (Incorrect, the curl of the magnetic field, from the Ampère-Maxwell law, does not change).
        *   D) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. (Incorrect, neither of these change).

The analysis clearly shows that the existence of magnetic monopoles would modify the equations for the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.
