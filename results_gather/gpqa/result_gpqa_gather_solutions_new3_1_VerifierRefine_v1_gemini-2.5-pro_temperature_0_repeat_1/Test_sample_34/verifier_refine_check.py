    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the quantum mechanics question.

    The question asks to identify the correct statement about the operator Ay, its eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
    Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4*pi) and S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

    The provided answer is 'A'.

    The statements from the question are:
    A) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.
    B) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.
    C) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.
    D) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1.
