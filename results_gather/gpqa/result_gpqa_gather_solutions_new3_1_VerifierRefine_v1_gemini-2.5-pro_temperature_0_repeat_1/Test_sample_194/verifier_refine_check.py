def check_exoplanet_period():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the exoplanet period question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Define the known parameters for Planet 1 (P1, b1).
    2.  Establish the limiting condition for Planet 2. The maximum orbital period corresponds
        to the maximum semi-major axis, which in turn corresponds to the maximum impact
        parameter for which a transit can occur. The standard definition for a transit
        (where the planet's center crosses the star's disk) has a limiting impact
        parameter of b_max = 1.
    3.  Relate the semi-major axes of the two planets. The impact parameter 'b' is given by
        b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s. Since the inclination 'i' and stellar radius 'R_s' are
        the same for both planets, the ratio of their semi-major axes is equal to the
        ratio of their impact parameters: a2/a1 = b2/b1.
    4.  Apply Kepler's Third Law, which states (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3, to find the
        maximum period for Planet 2.
    5.  Compare the calculated result with the provided answer's value and chosen option.
