    # 1. Verify Reagent A
    # The reaction is an enamine synthesis from a secondary amine (3-methylpyrrolidine).
    # This requires a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone).
    # Retrosynthesis of the product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine,
    # reveals the required carbonyl compound is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
