def check_luminosity_ratio():
    """
    Calculates the luminosity ratio of two stars based on the given physical parameters.

    The function verifies the final answer by following these steps:
    1.  Uses the Stefan-Boltzmann law to establish the relationship between luminosity, radius, and temperature.
    2.  Uses the given radius ratio (R1/R2 = 1.5).
    3.  Calculates the temperature ratio (T1/T2) by considering:
        a. Wien's Displacement Law (T is inversely proportional to the intrinsic peak wavelength).
        b. The Doppler effect, which shifts the wavelength for the moving star (Star_2).
    4.  Combines these ratios to find the final luminosity ratio.

    # --- Given information ---
    # Radius ratio of Star_1 to Star_2
    R1_over_R2 = 1.5
    # Radial velocity of Star_1 (km/s)
    v1 = 0.0
    # Radial velocity of Star_2 (km/s)
    v2 = 700.0
    # Speed of light (km/s)
    c = 299792.458

    # --- Step 1: Formulate the luminosity ratio ---
    # From the Stefan-Boltzmann Law (L ∝ R²T⁴), the luminosity ratio is:
    # L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the radius term ---
    radius_term = R1_over_R2 ** 2
    # Expected value is 1.5² = 2.25

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2) ---
    # From Wien's Law, T ∝ 1/λ_emitted, so T1/T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1.
    # We need to find the ratio of the intrinsic (emitted) wavelengths.

    # The problem states the observed wavelengths are the same: λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.
    # We relate observed and emitted wavelengths using the Doppler effect:
    # λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c)

    # For Star_1 (v1 = 0): λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_emitted_1
    # For Star_2 (v2 = 700): λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)

    # Since λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2, we have:
    # λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)

    # Rearranging to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:
    # λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)

    # Therefore, the temperature ratio is:
    T1_over_T2 = 1 / (1 + v2 / c)

    # The temperature term in the luminosity equation is (T1/T2)⁴
    temperature_term = T1_over_T2 ** 4

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the final luminosity ratio ---
    luminosity_ratio = radius_term * temperature_term

    # The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.23, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.32
