Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final product.

**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**

*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.
*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE is calculated as C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (likely a carbonyl C=O).
*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**
    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group). This confirms a -CH₂-CHO fragment.
    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal is for a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet (d) splitting confirms it is coupled to a single proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This reinforces the presence of the -CH₂-CHO fragment.
    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.
    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH₂). The amine is an electron-donating group, which explains the upfield chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.
*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling the fragments (a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂CHO group) leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.

**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**

The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.

*   **1. NaNO₂ + HCl:** This is a **diazotization** reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate is 2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride.
*   **2. H₂O:** This step is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.
*   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (on the -CH₂- group).
    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) facilitates the reaction between two molecules of the aldehyde to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The initial product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (which is option A).
    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The key condition here is **"Heat"**. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is favorable as it forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

**Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**

The dehydration of the intermediate, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, results in the elimination of the -OH group from carbon-3 and a proton from carbon-2. This forms a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.

**Step 4: Matching with the Given Options**

*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. It is not the final product under heating conditions.
*   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: This is incorrect. The substituents are hydroxyphenyl, not phenyl, and the double bond position is wrong.
*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This structure correctly represents the final, dehydrated product of the self-aldol condensation.
*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This is not a product of a self-condensation reaction.

The final product of the entire sequence is the aldol condensation product.
