    # Fact 1: The core reason for the milder phenotype in Klinefelter's (XXY) vs. Down's (Trisomy 21)
    # is X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a dosage compensation mechanism.
    # Fact 2: XCI is an epigenetic process that occurs post-zygotically (after fertilization).
    # Fact 3: Key molecular events in XCI include histone modifications, such as methylation by histone methyltransferases.
    # Fact 4: There is no equivalent inactivation mechanism for autosomes like chromosome 21.
    # Fact 5: Processes like spindle attachment or chiasmata resolution are part of meiosis; errors here *cause* aneuploidy
    # but do not explain the *consequences* or severity of the resulting syndrome.
    # Fact 6: DNA polymerase alpha is involved in general DNA replication, not specific dosage compensation.
