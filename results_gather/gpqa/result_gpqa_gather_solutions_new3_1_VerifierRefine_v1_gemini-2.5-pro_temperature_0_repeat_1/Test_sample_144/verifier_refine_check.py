def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the number of stereoisomers
    of the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

    The verification process follows these steps:
    1.  Analyze the molecule's structure to identify all potential stereocenters.
    2.  Count the number of chiral carbons (asymmetric carbons).
    3.  Count the number of stereogenic double bonds (capable of E/Z isomerism).
    4.  Sum these counts to get the total number of stereocenters (n).
    5.  Check for molecular symmetry to determine if meso compounds are possible.
    6.  Calculate the total number of stereoisomers using the formula 2^n.
    7.  Compare the calculated result with the provided answer (16).
