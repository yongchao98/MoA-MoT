### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question

1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Setup:**
    *   **Technique:** ChIP-seq, a method to find DNA binding sites for a specific protein.
    *   **Protein:** IKAROS, a key transcription factor in B cell development. Transcription factors often work in large protein complexes.
    *   **Variable:** The chemical fixation method used to cross-link proteins to DNA.
    *   **Condition 1 (Peaks Present):** PFA (paraformaldehyde) only. PFA is a short-range cross-linker, excellent for capturing proteins in direct or very close contact with DNA. This is the standard, "lighter" fixation method.
    *   **Condition 2 (Peaks Disappear):** PFA + DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate). DSG is a longer-range, protein-to-protein cross-linker. It is used before PFA to first stabilize large protein complexes, and then PFA is used to attach the whole complex to DNA. This is a "stronger," more extensive fixation method.

2.  **Analyze the Core Observation:**
    The central puzzle is that peaks detected with the standard PFA method *disappear* when using the supposedly more robust PFA+DSG method. Intuitively, a stronger fixation should capture more interactions or strengthen existing ones, not cause them to vanish. This counter-intuitive result points to a specific biochemical or technical reason.

3.  **Evaluate the Competing Hypotheses:**
    There are two primary explanations for this phenomenon, which lead to different answers:

    *   **Hypothesis A: Epitope Masking at Functional Sites.**
        *   **Mechanism:** IKAROS functions at active promoters and enhancers by assembling large, dense multi-protein complexes. The addition of the protein-protein cross-linker DSG creates a dense, covalently linked web of proteins around IKAROS. This web can physically block the antibody from accessing its binding site (epitope) on IKAROS. If the antibody cannot bind, the complex is not immunoprecipitated, and the peak "disappears."
        *   **Implication:** This would mean the disappearing peaks are at the most important functional sites: **C) At active promoters and enhancers**.

    *   **Hypothesis B: Artifact Removal or Insolubility at Problematic Regions.**
        *   **Mechanism 1 (Artifact Removal):** The peaks seen with PFA-only were not true, stable binding events but rather artifacts from weak or non-specific interactions. Repetitive DNA regions are known to be "sticky" and can cause such artifacts. The more stringent PFA+DSG fixation stabilizes the true binding sites (at promoters/enhancers), increasing their signal-to-noise ratio and causing the weaker, artifactual peaks to fall below the detection threshold.
        *   **Mechanism 2 (Insolubility):** IKAROS is known to bind to pericentromeric heterochromatin, which is dense and composed of highly repetitive DNA. These regions are already difficult to break apart (sonicate) and solubilize. The heavy PFA+DSG cross-linking could make these regions completely insoluble. Insoluble chromatin is pelleted and discarded early in the ChIP protocol, meaning these regions are never even subjected to immunoprecipitation, causing the peaks to disappear.
        *   **Implication:** Both mechanisms in this hypothesis point to the disappearing peaks being located at **A) At repeats**.

4.  **Compare the Hypotheses:**
    *   The epitope masking hypothesis (A) is plausible but suggests that the "better" technique fails at the most important sites, which is possible but perhaps less likely than the alternative.
    *   The artifact/insolubility hypothesis (B) is very compelling because it combines a known, specific biological role of IKAROS (binding to heterochromatin/repeats) with a well-known technical challenge in ChIP-seq (artifacts and poor solubility associated with repetitive DNA). The complete disappearance of a class of peaks is explained well by their either being artifacts or becoming experimentally intractable (insoluble) with the stronger fixation. This provides a more specific and robust explanation for the observation.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    The most likely explanation is that the disappearing peaks are located in regions that are either prone to artifacts with lighter fixation or become insoluble with heavier fixation. Given IKAROS's known association with pericentromeric heterochromatin, which is composed of repetitive DNA, this is the most probable location for such disappearing peaks.
