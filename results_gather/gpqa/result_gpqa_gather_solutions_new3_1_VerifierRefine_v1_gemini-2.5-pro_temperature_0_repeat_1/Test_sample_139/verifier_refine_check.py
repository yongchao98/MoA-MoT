def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by logically solving the chemical puzzle step-by-step and performing the required calculation.

    # Step 1: Identify the substances based on the clues provided in the question.
    # - Clue: "The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K."
    #   - 277 K is 3.85 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D2O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong match.
    #   - Therefore, Substance B is D2O.
    
    # - Clue: "...a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons..."
    #   - A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.
    #   - A molecule of deuterium gas (D2) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the clue perfectly.
    #   - Therefore, Gas W is D2.

    # - Clue: "Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...", "...its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.",
    #   "The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen."
    #   - A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A product with 2 oxygens implies reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohols (a diol, e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH2OH).
    #   - This requires a strong reducing agent. A very common one is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4).
    #   - Its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4), fits all clues for Substance X.
    substance_x_formula = "LiAlD4"

    # - The full reaction sequence confirms these identities:
    #   LiAlD4(X) + 4D2O(Y) -> 4D2(W) + Al(OD)3(G) + LiOD.
    #   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)3) yields D2O (B). All clues are consistent.

    # Step 2: Perform the calculation as requested by the question.
    # "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X..."
    
    # The elements in LiAlD4 are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).
    # The lightest element is Hydrogen.
    # The heaviest element is Aluminum.
    
    # We use integer mass numbers for the calculation, as implied by the integer options.
    # Mass number of Deuterium (D, or ²H) is 2.
    # Mass number of the stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.
    
    # The formula LiAlD4 contains:
    # - 4 atoms of the lightest element's isotope (Deuterium).
    # - 1 atom of the heaviest element (Aluminum).
    
    mass_from_lightest_element = 4 * 2  # 4 atoms * mass of Deuterium
    mass_from_heaviest_element = 1 * 27  # 1 atom * mass of Aluminum
    
    correct_calculated_value = mass_from_lightest_element + mass_from_heaviest_element
    
    # Step 3: Check the provided LLM's answer against the correct calculation.
    # The LLM's final answer is <<<A>>>.
    # The options given in the question are A) 35, B) 31, C) 25, D) 29.
    llm_answer_choice = 'A'
    options = {'A': 35, 'B': 31, 'C': 25, 'D': 29}
    llm_answer_value = options[llm_answer_choice]
    
    if llm_answer_value == correct_calculated_value:
        return "Correct"
    else:
        return (f"Reason: The final answer is incorrect. "
                f"The provided answer is {llm_answer_value} (Option {llm_answer_choice}), but the correct calculated value is {correct_calculated_value}. "
                f"The calculation for Substance X (LiAlD4) is: "
                f"(4 * mass of Deuterium) + (1 * mass of Aluminum) = (4 * 2) + (1 * 27) = 8 + 27 = 35.")
