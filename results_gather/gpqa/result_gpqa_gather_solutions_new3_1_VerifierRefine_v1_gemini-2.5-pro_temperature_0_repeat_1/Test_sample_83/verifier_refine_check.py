    Checks the correctness of the answer to the question about parallelizing heat equation solvers.

    The question asks for the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one
    when using a fractional approximation for the matrix exponential.

    The core requirements for the correct answer are:
    1. It must be a property or technique related to the "fractional approximation".
    2. It must be the direct mechanism that "splits" a single large task into multiple,
       independent, and concurrent sub-tasks.
