    # --- Analysis of Reaction A ---
    # Reactant: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Structure: CH3-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2-CH3
    # Step 1: Carbocation Stability
    # - Carbocation at C3: Tertiary.
    # - Carbocation at C4: Tertiary and Benzylic (stabilized by Phenyl group).
    # Conclusion: Carbocation forms at C4 (more stable).
    # Step 2: Migratory Aptitude
    # - Groups on adjacent C3: Methyl and Ethyl.
    # - Aptitude: Ethyl > Methyl.
    # Conclusion: Ethyl group migrates from C3 to C4.
    # Step 3: Product Formation
    # - Ketone forms at C3. The resulting structure is CH3-C(=O)-C(Ph)(Et)2.

    # --- Analysis of Reaction B ---
    # Reactant: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Structure: CH3-C(OH)(Ph)-C(OH)(p-OH-Ph)-CH2-CH3
    # Step 1: Carbocation Stability
    # - Carbocation at C2: Tertiary, Benzylic (stabilized by Phenyl).
    # - Carbocation at C3: Tertiary, Benzylic (stabilized by 4-hydroxyphenyl).
    # - The -OH on the 4-hydroxyphenyl is strongly electron-donating, making it a better stabilizer.
    # Conclusion: Carbocation forms at C3 (more stable).
    # Step 2: Migratory Aptitude
    # - Groups on adjacent C2: Phenyl and Methyl.
    # - Aptitude: Phenyl (Aryl) > Methyl (Alkyl).
    # Conclusion: Phenyl group migrates from C2 to C3.
    # Step 3: Product Formation
    # - Ketone forms at C2. The resulting structure is CH3-C(=O)-C(Ph)(p-OH-Ph)(Et).

    # --- Analysis of Reaction C ---
    # Reactant: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # Let An = 4-methoxyphenyl (Anisyl)
    # Structure: (An)2-C(OH)-C(OH)(An)(Ph)
    # Step 1: Carbocation Stability
    # - Carbocation at C1: Stabilized by two Anisyl groups.
    # - Carbocation at C2: Stabilized by one Anisyl and one Phenyl group.
    # - Anisyl is a much stronger electron-donating group than Phenyl.
    # Conclusion: Carbocation forms at C1 (more stable).
    # Step 2: Migratory Aptitude
    # - Groups on adjacent C2: Anisyl and Phenyl.
    # - Aptitude: Anisyl > Phenyl (due to electron-donating -OCH3).
    # Conclusion: Anisyl group migrates from C2 to C1.
    # Step 3: Product Formation
    # - Ketone forms at C2. The resulting structure is (An)3-C-C(=O)-Ph.
