    Checks the correctness of the answer to the CERN Bubble Chamber problem.
    
    The steps are:
    1. Define constants and given values.
    2. Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) of the particle in the lab frame.
    3. Calculate the maximum allowed resolution to observe at least 30% of decays.
    4. Check if the provided answer satisfies this condition and is plausibly the intended answer.
