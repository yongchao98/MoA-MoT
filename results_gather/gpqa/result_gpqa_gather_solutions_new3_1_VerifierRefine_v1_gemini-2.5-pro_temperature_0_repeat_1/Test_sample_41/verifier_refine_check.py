    # 1. Relate Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) to Orbital Distance (a).
    # T_eq is proportional to 1 / sqrt(a).
    # This means a is proportional to 1 / T_eq^2.
    # Therefore, a_j / a_i = (T_i / T_j)^2.

    # 2. Calculate the ratio of orbital distances.
    # Ratio for Planet 1 and 2
    a2_a1_ratio = t1_t2_ratio ** 2
    
    # Ratio for Planet 2 and 3
    a3_a2_ratio = t2_t3_ratio ** 2
    
    # Overall ratio for Planet 1 and 3
    a3_a1_ratio = a2_a1_ratio * a3_a2_ratio
    
    # 3. Relate Orbital Distance (a) to Orbital Period (P) using Kepler's Third Law.
    # P^2 is proportional to a^3.
    # This means P is proportional to a^(3/2).
    # Therefore, P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2).

    # 4. Calculate the final ratio of orbital periods (P3 / P1).
    p3_p1_ratio = a3_a1_ratio ** 1.5
