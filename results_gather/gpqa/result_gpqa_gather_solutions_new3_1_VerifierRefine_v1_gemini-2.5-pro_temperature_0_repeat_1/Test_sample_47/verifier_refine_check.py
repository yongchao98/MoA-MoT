def check_chemistry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the organic chemistry synthesis problem.

    The verification process involves:
    1.  Confirming the reaction pathway to identify the final product.
    2.  Analyzing the symmetry of the final product to determine the correct number of distinct hydrogens.
    3.  Comparing this correct number with the number derived from the provided answer's reasoning.
    4.  Verifying that the final answer tag (e.g., 'C') corresponds to the correct number based on the question's options.

    # --- Step 1: Define the correct chemical pathway and final product ---
    # The reaction sequence is:
    # 1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 -> 2-bromocyclohexanone (alpha-bromination)
    # 2. 2-bromocyclohexanone + NaOH -> Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Favorskii rearrangement)
    # 3. Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl2 -> Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (acid chloride formation)
    # 4. Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAlH(OtBu)3 -> Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (selective reduction)

    # The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the aldehyde group and C1.
    # - 1 type: The aldehyde proton.
    # - 1 type: The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde).
    # - 2 types: The four protons on C2 and C5 (these carbons are equivalent, but the two geminal protons on each are diastereotopic).
    # - 2 types: The four protons on C3 and C4 (these carbons are equivalent, but the two geminal protons on each are also diastereotopic).
