    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the astronomy problem.

    The problem involves two scenarios causing a dip in a star's brightness:
    1. Rotational modulation due to a hemisphere covered in cool spots.
    2. A hypothetical exoplanet transit in front of an unspotted star.

    The goal is to find the exoplanet-to-star radius ratio (R_pl/R_star) that
    produces the same brightness dip (amplitude) as the starspots.
