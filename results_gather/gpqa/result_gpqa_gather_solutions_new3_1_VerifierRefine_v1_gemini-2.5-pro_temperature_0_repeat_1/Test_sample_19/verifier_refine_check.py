    #    problem to a sum of one-body problems. This is a necessary assumption.
    # 2. Nucleus is transparent: This means neglecting initial and final state interactions.
    #    For the nucleon to behave as if it were truly "free", it must not interact with
    #    other nucleons on its way in or out. This is a necessary assumption.
    # 3. Quarks are non-relativistic: This concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself,
    #    not the nucleon's behavior within the nucleus, which is the domain of the impulse
    #    approximation. This is NOT a necessary assumption.
    # 4. No binding forces: This is the "impulse" part of the name. The interaction is so fast
    #    that the binding potential is negligible during the event. This is a necessary assumption.
