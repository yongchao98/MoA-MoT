    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the drug discovery question.

    The question asks for the MOST crucial step BEFORE extensive in silico docking
    for a complex molecule with multiple chiral centers and tautomers.

    - A) Focus on ADME/pharmacokinetics. (Incorrect - premature step)
    - B) Analyze and prioritize all forms computationally. (Good, but less robust than D)
    - C) Use only the most stable form. (Incorrect - flawed assumption)
    - D) Combine in silico predictions with preliminary in vitro assays. (Correct - most robust strategy)

This integration minimizes risk and maximizes the efficient use of resources."
