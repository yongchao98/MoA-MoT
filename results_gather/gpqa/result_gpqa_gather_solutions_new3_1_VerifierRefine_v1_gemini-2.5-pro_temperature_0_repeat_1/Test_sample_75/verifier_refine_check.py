    Checks the correctness of the answer based on biological principles.

    The question asks for the "first thing you notice" in a chimera experiment.

    1. The literal observation at the earliest time point (12h).
    2. The first significant scientific finding related to the research goal.

    # --- Define Experimental Principles ---
    # Principle 1: The red signal (mRaspberry) is controlled by a lineage-specific promoter.
    # This means it's OFF in undifferentiated iPSCs and only turns ON after differentiation, which takes time.
    red_signal_requires_differentiation = True
    differentiation_takes_time = True

    # Principle 2: The green signal (TUNEL) marks apoptosis.
    # Apoptosis is expected due to normal development and rejection of injected cells.
    green_signal_is_expected = True

    # Principle 3: The mRaspberry protein is cytoplasmic by default.
    protein_localization = "cytoplasmic"

    # The provided answer from the LLM

    # --- Evaluate Options ---
    options = {
        "A": "there is no green signal",
        "B": "green signal colocalizes with the red signal",
        "C": "cell line-specific red signals label different organelles",
        "D": "cytoplasmic localization of the red signal"

    # --- Check Flaws in Incorrect Options ---
    # Check A:
    if not green_signal_is_expected:
        # This condition is never met, but it shows the logic.

    else:
        # A is incorrect because apoptosis is expected.
        if llm_answer == "A":
            return "Incorrect. Option A is biologically implausible. Apoptosis (green signal) is a normal part of embryogenesis and a common fate for injected cells that fail to integrate."

    # Check C:
    if "organelles" in options["C"]:
        # C is incorrect because the promoter doesn't determine localization, and mRaspberry is cytoplasmic.
        if llm_answer == "C":
            return "Incorrect. Option C is factually wrong. A promoter controls WHEN a gene is expressed, not WHERE the protein goes. The mRaspberry protein is cytoplasmic, it does not label specific organelles unless engineered to do so."

    # Check D:
    # D is a true but trivial statement about the reporter protein. It's not a significant finding about cell fate.
    if llm_answer == "D":
        return "Incorrect. Option D describes a basic property of the reporter protein, not a significant biological finding. The question asks what you would 'notice,' implying a key event. The fate of the cells (Option B) is a more significant finding than the subcellular location of a protein."

        # Under a literal interpretation at t=12h, B would be wrong because no red signal is expected yet.

        # asks for the first *significant finding*.
        # The elimination of aberrantly differentiating cells (which would be both red and green) is a key,
        # common, and early finding in these experiments. It directly addresses the research question.
