Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.

**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**
*   **Starting Material:** The initial reactant is *trans*-cinnamaldehyde. Its chemical structure is a phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a *trans*-propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO).
*   **Carbon Count of Starting Material:** We count the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring + 3 in the propenal chain = **9 carbon atoms**.
*   **Reaction 1:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent. The methyl group (CH₃⁻) from the Grignard reagent acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. This is a 1,2-addition reaction.
*   **Product 1:** The reaction adds one carbon atom from the methyl group. The aldehyde is converted into a secondary alcohol. The structure of Product 1 is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.
*   **Carbon Count of Product 1:** 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from the methyl group) = **10 carbon atoms**.

**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**
*   **Starting Material for Step 2:** Product 1, which is a secondary alcohol with 10 carbons.
*   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent.
*   **Reaction 2:** PCC oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone. This reaction changes the functional group but does not add or remove any carbon atoms from the molecule's skeleton.
*   **Product 2:** The secondary alcohol group is oxidized to a ketone group, forming (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, also known as benzalacetone.
*   **Carbon Count of Product 2:** The number of carbons remains unchanged. Product 2 has **10 carbon atoms**.

**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**
*   **Starting Material for Step 3:** Product 2, which is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with 10 carbons. (Note: The prompt has a typo stating "3 was treated...". It is logically assumed that "Product 2 was treated..." to form Product 3).
*   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the systematic name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)]CH₂. This is a sulfur ylide known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.
*   **Reaction 3:** When the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with an α,β-unsaturated ketone, it performs a conjugate addition (1,4-addition). The methylene group (CH₂) from the ylide adds across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.
*   **Product 3:** The reaction adds one carbon atom (from the CH₂ group of the ylide) to the structure of Product 2.
*   **Carbon Count of Product 3:** 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the ylide's methylene group) = **11 carbon atoms**.

**Final Conclusion:**
The number of carbon atoms is tracked through the synthesis:
*   trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 C
*   Product 1: 9 + 1 = 10 C
*   Product 2: 10 + 0 = 10 C
*   Product 3: 10 + 1 = 11 C

The final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms. Comparing this result with the given options:
A) 10
B) 12
C) 11
D) 14

The correct option is C.
