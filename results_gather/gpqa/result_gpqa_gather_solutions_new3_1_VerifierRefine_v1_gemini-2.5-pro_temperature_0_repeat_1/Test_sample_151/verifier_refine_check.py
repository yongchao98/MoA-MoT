    # Define the biological context based on the question.
    # 1. Yeast shmoo formation implies cell cycle arrest in G1 phase.
    # 2. G1 arrest for mating involves high transcriptional activity of mating-related genes.
    # 3. G1 arrest for mating involves the inhibition of progression into S phase (DNA replication).
    # 4. The experiment (ChIP-MS) targets 'active chromatin', which is enriched for proteins
    #    involved in active transcription.

    # Define the properties of each protein complex.
    # 'relevance_score' represents the expected abundance in an 'active chromatin' pulldown.
    # Higher score = more abundant.
    # 3: Core structural component or directly driving the primary cellular activity (transcription).
    # 2: Essential for the primary cellular activity (transcription).
    # 1: Associated with a secondary or inhibited cellular process (replication).
