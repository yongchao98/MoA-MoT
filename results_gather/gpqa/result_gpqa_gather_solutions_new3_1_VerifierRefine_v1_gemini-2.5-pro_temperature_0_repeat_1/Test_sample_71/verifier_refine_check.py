Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**

*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative) and 2 equivalents of a diene precursor, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, with sodium iodide (NaI).
*   **Reaction Analysis:** The name of the diene precursor is unusual. However, the reaction of 1,2-bis(halomethyl)arenes with NaI is a standard method for generating highly reactive *o*-quinodimethanes (*o*-xylylenes) *in situ*. It is highly probable that the intended precursor is 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene, which generates *o*-quinodimethane. This reactive diene is then trapped by the dienophile, the norbornadiene derivative.
*   Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Two molecules of *o*-quinodimethane add across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene.
*   **Product 1** is the resulting large, symmetric bis-adduct.

**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**

*   **Reactant:** Product 1.
*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).
*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) at the C7 bridge position is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).
*   **Product 2** is the corresponding alcohol, maintaining the large polycyclic skeleton.

**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**

*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (a secondary alcohol).
*   **Reagents:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).
*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a mild oxidation that converts the secondary alcohol at C7 into a ketone (C=O).
*   **Product 3** is the corresponding ketone.

**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**

*   **Reactant:** Product 3.
*   **Condition:** Heating at 150°C.
*   **Reaction Analysis:** Heating a Diels-Alder adduct often induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. In this case, the double adduct (Product 3) fragments, reversing the initial cycloadditions.
    *   This fragmentation releases two molecules of the diene, **o-quinodimethane**.
    *   It also releases the central dienophile core, which is now **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.
*   **Fate of the Fragments:** Both fragments are unstable and react further under the thermal conditions.
    *   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.
    *   The two molecules of *o*-quinodimethane are highly reactive and are generated in close proximity. They will rapidly react, primarily by dimerizing. The major thermal dimerization product of *o*-quinodimethane is **dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene**, formed via a [4+4] cycloaddition.
*   **Identification of Product 4:** The question asks for the analysis of the "final product 4". This phrasing implies a single, stable, major organic product derived from the main reaction pathway. While benzene is also formed, the product derived from the diene precursor is the molecule of interest. Therefore, **Product 4 is dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene**.

**Step 5: Analysis of Product 4**

*   **Structure:** Product 4 is dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctadiene (C₁₆H₁₆).
*   **Symmetry:** This molecule is not planar. It adopts a stable, chiral, puckered "tub" conformation that belongs to the **C₂ point group**. The C₂ axis of symmetry passes through the center of the molecule, relating the two benzene rings and the aliphatic portions of the central eight-membered ring.
*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** We use the C₂ symmetry to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments.
    1.  **Aromatic Hydrogens:** There are 8 aromatic protons in total. The C₂ axis makes the two benzene rings equivalent. However, within a single benzene ring, none of the four protons are related by symmetry. Therefore, there are **4 distinct types of aromatic hydrogens**.
    2.  **Aliphatic (Benzylic) Hydrogens:** There are 8 aliphatic protons in the four -CH₂- groups of the central ring. The C₂ axis relates the CH₂ groups in pairs, so there are two non-equivalent types of CH₂ groups. Within each CH₂ group, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic (not interchangeable by symmetry) because the molecule is chiral. This results in **4 distinct types of aliphatic hydrogens**.
*   **Total Count:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of the unique aromatic and aliphatic types: 4 (aromatic) + 4 (aliphatic) = **8**.
