    # T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)
    # This derivation assumes:
    # 1. T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a) (where 'a' is the semi-major axis)
    # 2. K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a) (where K is the RV semi-amplitude)
    # 3. K ∝ Δλ (where Δλ is the Doppler shift)

    mass_ratio = m_p2 / m_p1

    # Calculate the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ1 / Δλ2)
