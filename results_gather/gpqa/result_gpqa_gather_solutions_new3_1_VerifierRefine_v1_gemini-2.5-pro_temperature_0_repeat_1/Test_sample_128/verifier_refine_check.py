    # --- Step 1: Verify the structure of Compound A ---
    # Hint (a): Retro-Wittig analysis
    # The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
    # The ylide part is =C(CH3)2. The ketone part is the rest.
    # Replacing =C(CH3)2 at position 4 with =O gives a ketone.
    # IUPAC naming requires the carbonyl to be C1. If C=O is C1, the methyls are at C3 and C4.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence (Tiffeneau-Demjanov Rearrangement) ---
    # The sequence is:
    # Ketone -> Cyanohydrin -> 1-aminomethyl-cycloalkanol -> Diazonium salt -> Ring-expanded ketone
    # This is a classic Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement.
    # The key transformation is the one-carbon ring expansion.
    # Starting ring: cyclopentane (5-membered) from Compound A.
    # Final ring: cyclohexane (6-membered) for Compound E.
    
    # --- Step 3: Deduce the structure of Compound E ---
    # The starting ketone is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one.
    # The rearrangement expands the 5-membered ring to a 6-membered ring.
    # The methyl groups at positions 3 and 4 are retained relative to the carbonyl group.
    # Therefore, the product is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.

    # --- Step 4: Verify Compound E with hints and options ---
