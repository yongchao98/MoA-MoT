    # The goal is to find the ratio R = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.
    # The calculation proceeds by finding the logarithmic ratio first.
    # log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2

    # Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Star 1.
    # The property [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C] is used.
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    si_h_1 = si_fe_1 + fe_h_1

    # Step 2: Calculate [Si/H] for Star 2.
    # The property is rearranged: [A/C] = [B/C] - [B/A] or [Si/H] = [Mg/H] - [Mg/Si].
    # [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    si_h_2 = mg_h_2 - mg_si_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of the final ratio.
    # log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2
    log_ratio = si_h_1 - si_h_2

    # Step 4: Calculate the final ratio by taking the antilogarithm.
    # R = 10 ^ log_ratio
    calculated_ratio = 10**log_ratio
