    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.

    **Part A: Tautomerism**

    The question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

    1.  **Principle of Tautomerism:** Keto-enol tautomerism, the most common type, requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen (α-hydrogen), and the carbon it's attached to is an alpha-carbon (α-carbon). Typically, this α-carbon is sp³ hybridized.

    2.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**
        *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two C=C double bonds.
        *   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the ketone groups are part of the ring's double bonds. They are sp² hybridized.
        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These sp² hybridized carbons do not have the type of α-hydrogens on a saturated carbon that readily participate in keto-enol tautomerism. The conversion of benzoquinone to its corresponding diol (hydroquinone) is a reduction reaction, not an isomerization, as the molecular formula changes.
        *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does **not** show tautomerism.

    3.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**
        *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.
        *   **Alpha-Carbons:** These CH₂ groups are α-carbons. They are sp³ hybridized.
        *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** These carbons have α-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.
        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to readily undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is highly stable due to its aromaticity. Therefore, it **does** show tautomerism.

    **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

    ---

    **Part B: Optical Isomerism**

    The question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

    1.  **Principle of Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

    2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**
        *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
        *   **Chiral Center:** The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:
            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)
            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)
            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)
            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)
        *   **Conclusion:** Since C2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.

    3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**
        *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate.
        *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It has no chiral centers.
        *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it will **not** show optical isomerism.

    **Result for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    ---

    **Final Conclusion**

    *   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
    *   Compound (B) that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    Matching this result with the given options:
    A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
    B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
    C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate
    D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

    The correct option is B.
