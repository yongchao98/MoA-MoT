def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by performing the quantum mechanics calculations.
    
    The steps are:
    1. Define the initial state and operators from the problem description.
    2. Normalize the initial state vector.
    3. Calculate the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for operator P.
        a. Find the normalized eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue 0.
        b. Project the normalized initial state onto this eigenvector and square the magnitude.
    4. Determine the new state of the system after it collapses to the eigenvector from the first measurement.
    5. Calculate the probability of measuring the eigenvalue -1 for operator Q on the new state.
        a. Find the normalized eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue -1.
        b. Project the collapsed state onto this eigenvector and square the magnitude.
    6. Calculate the total probability by multiplying the probabilities from steps 3 and 5.
    7. Compare the calculated total probability with the expected answer (1/6).
