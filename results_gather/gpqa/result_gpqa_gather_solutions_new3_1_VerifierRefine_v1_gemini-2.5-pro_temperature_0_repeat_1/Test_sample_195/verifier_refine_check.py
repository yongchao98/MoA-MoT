    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Derives the expression for v_max from the principle of conservation of relativistic energy.
    2. Compares the derived expression with the given options (A, B, C, D).
    3. Checks if the LLM's chosen answer (B) matches the correct derivation.
    4. Verifies that the correct relativistic formula correctly reduces to the classical formula in the non-relativistic limit (c -> infinity).
    5. Checks the dimensional consistency of the options.
