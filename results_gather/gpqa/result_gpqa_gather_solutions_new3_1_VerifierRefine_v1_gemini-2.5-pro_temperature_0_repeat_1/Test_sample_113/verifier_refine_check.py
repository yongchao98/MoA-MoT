Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:

**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**
*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
*   **Identify the transformation:** A ketone (butan-2-one) is converted into a cyanohydrin. This involves adding a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydrogen atom across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction known as cyanohydrin formation.
*   **Determine the mechanism and the role of reagent A:**
    1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.
    2.  This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate, which is negatively charged: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃`.
    3.  This intermediate must be protonated to form the final, stable product which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.
    4.  Reagent A must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺).
*   **Evaluate the options for A:**
    *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents an aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and is an excellent source of protons for the protonation step. This is a suitable choice.
    *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is a reagent used for a different type of carbonyl addition reaction (bisulfite addition), not for completing cyanohydrin formation.
*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options B and D.

**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**
*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
*   **Identify the transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.
*   **Determine the mechanism and the role of reagent B:**
    1.  The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, typically heating with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water.
    2.  Reagent B acts as the catalyst for this hydrolysis.
*   **Evaluate the options for B (from the remaining choices A and C):**
    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong mineral acid. Strong acids are standard and effective catalysts for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The reaction would be extremely slow or incomplete.
*   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B must be HCl**.

**Step 3: Combine the results and select the final answer.**
*   From Step 1, we determined that **A = H₃O⁺**.
*   From Step 2, we determined that **B = HCl**.
*   The option that matches this combination is A.

**Final Answer:** The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
