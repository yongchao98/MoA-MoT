    Checks the derivation for the star distribution problem using symbolic math.

    The problem asks for the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) given that
    the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx)) is proportional to 1/plx^5.

    The key relationships are:
    1. dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5
    2. plx ∝ 1/r
    3. The transformation rule (from chain rule): dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|
