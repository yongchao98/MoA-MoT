    The core chemical principle is that the reaction (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) converts
    a ketone with an alpha-methylene group into an alpha-diketone.
    Therefore, the starting materials must be ketones.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:

**Step 1: Understand the Chemical Reaction**
The reagents provided are sodium nitrite (NaNO₂), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water (H₂O). When NaNO₂ and HCl are mixed, they react in situ to form nitrous acid (HONO). This set of reagents is used for a specific organic transformation known as α-nitrosation of ketones. The overall process converts a methylene group (`-CH₂-`) located adjacent (in the α-position) to a carbonyl group (`C=O`) into a new carbonyl group. This results in the formation of an α-diketone (also called a 1,2-diketone).

The net transformation is:
`R-CO-CH₂-R'  ---(NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O)--->  R-CO-CO-R'`

**Careful Point 1:** The starting material for this reaction must be a ketone that possesses at least one hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (an α-hydrogen). Alcohols, diols, or ethers will not undergo this specific transformation to yield an α-diketone.

**Step 2: Analyze the Formation of the First Product (from Compound A)**
*   **Product:** 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione.
*   **Analysis:** This is an α-diketone. The two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) of a cyclohexane ring. To form this product via the described reaction, the starting material (A) must have been a ketone with one of these carbonyl groups already present, and an adjacent methylene group.
*   **Deduction:** The only logical precursor is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. In this molecule, the carbonyl group is at C1. The adjacent carbon at C2 is a methylene group (`-CH₂-`). The reaction oxidizes this C2 position to form the second carbonyl group, yielding the desired 1,2-dione.
*   **Conclusion for A:** Compound A must be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one.

**Step 3: Analyze the Formation of the Second Product (from Compound B)**
*   **Product:** 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.
*   **Analysis:** This is an acyclic α-diketone with carbonyl groups at C2 and C3.
*   **Deduction:** Following the same logic, the starting material (B) must have been a ketone with a carbonyl group at either C2 or C3. Let's consider the most likely candidate, **5-methylhexan-2-one**. Its structure is `CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`. The carbonyl group is at C2. The adjacent carbons are C1 (a methyl group) and C3 (a methylene group). The reaction preferentially occurs at the methylene group (C3). The oxidation of the C3 methylene group results in the formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.
*   **Conclusion for B:** Compound B must be 5-methylhexan-2-one.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Options and Select the Final Answer**
Based on our analysis:
*   Compound A is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**.
*   Compound B is **5-methylhexan-2-one**.

Now, let's examine the given options:
*   A) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. (Incorrect, these are not ketones).
*   B) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol. (Incorrect, B is a diol, not a ketone).
*   C) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one. (Incorrect, A is an alcohol/ether, not a ketone).
*   D) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one. (Correct, this option matches both of our deduced starting materials).

The only option that provides the correct ketone precursors for both reactions is D.
