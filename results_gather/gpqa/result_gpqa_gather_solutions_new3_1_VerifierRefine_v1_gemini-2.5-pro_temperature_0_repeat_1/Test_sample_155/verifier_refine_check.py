Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### **Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reactions**

The core reaction sequence is a two-step process:
1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.
2.  **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (H₃O⁺):** This is an Sₙ2-like ring-opening of the epoxide by water, which is an *anti*-addition.

The overall transformation from alkene to diol is an **anti-dihydroxylation**. We can use stereochemical rules to predict the products for cis and trans starting materials.

**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**
*   **Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a **meso compound**.
*   **Detailed Path:**
    *   (E)-oct-4-ene (achiral) + mCPBA → Racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane (trans-epoxides).
    *   Hydrolysis of this racemic mixture leads to a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. (Both enantiomeric epoxides yield the same meso-diol upon anti-opening).
*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.

**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**
*   **Rule:** The *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.
*   **Detailed Path:**
    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene (achiral) + mCPBA → A single meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane (a cis-epoxide).
    *   Anti-opening of this meso-epoxide by water results in two different products: attack at one carbon gives (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.
*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic (1:1) mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

### **Step 2: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**

The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)
2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)
3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)

The stereochemical relationships are:
*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers**.
*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.

### **Step 3: Predict the Chromatographic Results**

**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**
*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity).
*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3).
*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).
*   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **two peaks**:
    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol
    *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol

**Chiral HPLC:**
*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.
*   It will separate the enantiomers (2 and 3) into two distinct peaks.
*   It will also separate the diastereomer (1) from the other two compounds.
*   **Result:** The chromatogram will resolve all three distinct stereoisomers, showing **three peaks**:
    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol
    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol
    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol

### **Conclusion**

The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.
