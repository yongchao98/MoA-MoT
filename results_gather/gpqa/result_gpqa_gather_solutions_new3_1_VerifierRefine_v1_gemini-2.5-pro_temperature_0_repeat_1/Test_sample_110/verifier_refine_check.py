    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two chemical reactions to determine the major products.

    ### **Analysis of Reaction A**

    **Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A

    1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. We have a ketone (which can form an enolate, the Michael donor), an α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor), and a strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK).

    2.  **Determine the Nucleophile (Enolate Formation):**
        *   The base, t-BuOK, will abstract an acidic proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) to form a nucleophilic enolate.
        *   The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.
        *   **At C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.
        *   **At C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.
        *   **Conclusion:** Deprotonation can only occur at the C6 position. The base removes this single proton to form a specific enolate.

    3.  **Predict the Addition Product:**
        *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).
        *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation (workup), a `-CH₂CH₂COOEt` group is attached to C6.

    4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of Product A:**
        *   The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate, which is appropriate since the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone.
        *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.
        *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent attached to the C3 position of the propanoate chain.
        *   To name the cyclic substituent, we number its carbons starting from the point of attachment. The original C6 of the ketone is now C1 of the substituent.
        *   The substituents on the ring are located as follows:
            *   At C1 (original C6): a **methyl** group.
            *   At C2 (original C1): the carbonyl group, named as **oxo**.
            *   At C3 (original C2): an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.
        *   Assembling the name of the substituent gives: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.
        *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.

    ### **Analysis of Reaction B**

    **Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B

    1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nitroalkane provides the nucleophile.

    2.  **Determine the Nucleophile:**
        *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).
        *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate), `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`, which acts as the nucleophile.

    3.  **Predict the Addition Product:**
        *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).
        *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.

    4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of Product B:**
        *   The resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.
        *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.
        *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile carbon is six carbons long. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.
        *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile end:
            `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`
        *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.
        *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

    ### **Conclusion**

    *   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.
    *   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.

    *   A) Incorrect A, Incorrect B
    *   B) Correct A, Incorrect B
    *   C) **Correct A, Correct B**
    *   D) Incorrect A, Correct B

    The correct option is C.
