def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the textile dye question.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from its energy.
    2.  Identify the color of the emitted light.
    3.  Apply the Stokes Shift principle: The absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted light.
    4.  Filter the options based on this principle.
    5.  Among the valid options, select the most plausible one (the adjacent color with higher energy, representing a typical Stokes Shift).
    6.  Compare this result with the provided answer.
