    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer based on the physics of mean free path.

    This function codifies the physical principles to derive the correct relationship
    between λ₁ (gas-gas MFP) and λ₂ (electron-gas MFP) and then compares it
    against the provided answer options.

    Args:
        llm_answer: The letter ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'D') corresponding to the
                    LLM's chosen answer.

        "Correct" if the answer is correct, or a string explaining the error if not.

    # --- Step 1: Define the physical relationships from first principles ---

    # The mean free path (λ) is given by λ = 1 / (n * σ), where n is the number
    # density and σ is the collision cross-section.

    # For λ₁ (gas-gas collisions), kinetic theory includes a √2 factor to account
    # for the relative motion of all gas molecules.
    # λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)

    # For λ₂ (high-energy electron-gas collisions), the gas molecules are effectively
    # stationary targets, so the √2 factor is absent.
    # λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)

    # The ratio of the two mean free paths is therefore:
    # λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]
    # λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the collision cross-sections ---

    # σ_gg is the kinetic cross-section for two molecules. It's related to the
    # physical size of the molecule.
    # σ_eg is the scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron.
    # To such a tiny, fast, penetrating particle, an atom is mostly empty space.
    # The interaction is brief, and the probability of a significant scattering event
    # is low. Therefore, the effective target area is small.
    # Conclusion: σ_gg is significantly larger than σ_eg.
    # This means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a value greater than 1.
    
    # Let's represent this ratio symbolically.
    cross_section_ratio = "a value > 1"  # Represents (σ_gg / σ_eg)

    # --- Step 3: Derive the final relationship ---

    # λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a value > 1)
    # Since √2 ≈ 1.414, the ratio λ₂ / λ₁ must be greater than 1.414.
    derived_ratio_lower_bound = math.sqrt(2)

    # A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁  => 1 < (λ₂/λ₁) < 1.22

    # C) λ₂ < λ₁             => (λ₂/λ₁) < 1
