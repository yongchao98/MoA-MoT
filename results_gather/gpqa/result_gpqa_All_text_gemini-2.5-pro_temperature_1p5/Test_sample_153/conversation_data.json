    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the most abundant isotopic version of the molecule is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The presence of a peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32% (compared to the M+ peak at 100%) is highly characteristic of a compound containing one chlorine (Cl) atom. The natural abundances of chlorine isotopes are approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl, which gives an expected M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1 (or 100%:33%). The observed ratio of 100%:32% is a perfect match.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch around 1720 cm⁻¹ in conjunction with the broad O-H stretch is definitive for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, a region characteristic of highly acidic protons. The chemical shift, singlet multiplicity (no adjacent protons), and integration (1H) are all perfectly consistent with the proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** Both of these signals are in the chemical shift range for aromatic protons (protons on a benzene ring).\n*   **Splitting Pattern and Integration (8.02 ppm, doublet, 2H; 7.72 ppm, doublet, 2H):**\n    *   The total integration in this region is 2H + 2H = 4H. This indicates a disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic fingerprint of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para arrangement leads to two sets of chemically equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by its neighbor.\n    *   The downfield shift (to 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm) indicates both substituents on the ring are electron-withdrawing. A carboxylic acid group is strongly electron-withdrawing, and a chlorine atom is also electron-withdrawing.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound has a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring, a carboxylic acid group, and four aromatic protons.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize All Data and Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **Summary:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid containing a single chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring in a *para* (1,4) arrangement relative to the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Proposed Structure:** This leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the options provided:\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, and the aromatic proton pattern would be different (1,2,3-trisubstituted).\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. The 4 aromatic protons would have a more complex splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid (lacks the acidic -OH group) and would have different IR and NMR signals.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data:\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ gives a molecular weight of ~156.5 g/mol (156 for ³⁵Cl isotope).\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Has a carboxylic acid proton (~11 ppm) and a *para*-disubstituted ring (two doublets, 2H each).\n\nThe unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
