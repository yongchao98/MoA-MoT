    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid - a strong acid):**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely in water: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻.\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Therefore, moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide - a strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely in water: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻, moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to remember that Ba(OH)₂ is a diprotic base, providing two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of the compound.\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with the acids present. The reaction with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) happens first and goes to completion, followed by the reaction with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Base vs. Strong Acid**\n    *   Reaction: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   H⁺ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    *   Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available (from previous step) = 0.100 mol\n    *   CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**Careful Point:** The order of reaction is important. The strongest acid always reacts with the strongest base first.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the composition of the final solution and calculate the pH.**\n\nAfter all the reactions are complete, the solution contains an excess of strong base (OH⁻). The presence of a strong base will be the primary factor determining the final pH. The other major species in the solution is the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻, but its contribution to the hydroxide concentration is negligible compared to the excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the final solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = (Moles of excess OH⁻) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for the pH, not the pOH. Don't stop after calculating the pOH.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
