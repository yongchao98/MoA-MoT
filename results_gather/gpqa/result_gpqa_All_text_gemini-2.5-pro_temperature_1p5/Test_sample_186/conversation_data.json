    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of detectable stars.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Detection Criteria\n\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if the ESPRESSO spectrograph, coupled with one 8m VLT telescope, can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure. There are two main conditions for a star to be detectable:\n\n1.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to meet the S/N requirement.\n2.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from the location of the VLT, which is the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Limiting Magnitude for ESPRESSO\n\nBy consulting the official ESPRESSO overview page provided, we can find its performance specifications. The page states:\n*\"In 1-UT mode [using one 8m telescope], ESPRESSO is expected to obtain S/N~10 in 1h for G2V stars down to V~16.5 mag.\"*\n\nThis gives us a clear brightness threshold:\n*   **Limiting Apparent Magnitude (V):** A star is bright enough if its apparent visual magnitude `V` is less than or equal to **16.5**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\n*   **Location:** Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately **-24.6 degrees**.\n*   **Visibility Window:** An object is only visible if it rises above the horizon. For good astronomical observations, it should rise to a reasonable altitude. An object at a declination (DEC) equal to the latitude of the North Pole (+90°) will always be at or below the horizon in the Southern Hemisphere.\n*   **Conclusion:** Stars with a very high positive declination will not be visible from Paranal. We must check the declination of each star.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will now evaluate each star against the two criteria: visibility from Paranal and having an apparent magnitude V ≤ 16.5.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately **-52° 42'**. This is well within the observable range for Paranal's southern latitude (-24.6°). It is easily visible.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the sky with an apparent magnitude **V ≈ -0.74**.\n*   **Verdict:** Since -0.74 ≤ 16.5 and it is visible, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of approximately **+89° 16'**. From Paranal's latitude of -24.6°, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and is **never visible**.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is V ≈ +1.98.\n*   **Verdict:** Because it is not visible from Paranal, **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute V mag M=15, d=10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of **0°** (on the celestial equator) is easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude (m) from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m - M = 5 * log10(d/10 pc)` or `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * (1) - 5\n    *   m = 15\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude is **V = 15**. Since 15 ≤ 16.5 and it is visible, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute V mag M=15, d=200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination of **0°** is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 11.5 - 5\n    *   m ≈ 21.5\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude is **V ≈ 21.5**. Since 21.5 > 16.5, this star is too faint. **This star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute V mag M=15, d=5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination of **0°** is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 3.5 - 5\n    *   m ≈ 13.5\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude is **V ≈ 13.5**. Since 13.5 ≤ 16.5 and it is visible, **this star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute V mag M=15, d=50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination of **0°** is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\n    *   m ≈ 15 + 8.5 - 5\n    *   m ≈ 18.5\n*   **Verdict:** The apparent magnitude is **V ≈ 18.5**. Since 18.5 > 16.5, this star is too faint. **This star is not detectable.**\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nLet's tally the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: Not detectable\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: Not detectable\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: Not detectable\n\nIn total, there are **3** detectable stars.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Visibility is a critical constraint.** An instrument cannot observe a target that never rises above its horizon. This immediately rules out Polaris for any observatory in the mid-southern hemisphere.\n2.  **Apparent vs. Absolute Magnitude.** The detection limit is based on the apparent magnitude (how bright the star appears from Earth), not its intrinsic brightness (absolute magnitude).\n3.  **Distance Modulus Formula.** Correctly applying the formula `m = M + 5*log10(d) - 5` is essential for converting between absolute and apparent magnitudes.\n4.  **Instrument-Specific Limits.** The limiting magnitude of V ≈ 16.5 is specific to ESPRESSO in the described configuration (1-UT, 1h exposure, S/N=10). Different instruments or observing modes would have different limits.\n\nThe analysis confirms that 3 out of the 6 listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
