    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the statement:** \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** Thermodynamics in electrochemistry is related to the standard reduction potential (E°). The strength of an oxidizing agent is directly proportional to its E° value. A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to compare the E° for the reduction of oxygen in basic solution to its reduction in acidic solution.\n        *   In **acidic solution**, the half-reaction is:\n            O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ ⇌ 2H₂O(l) ;  E° = +1.23 V\n        *   In **basic solution**, the half-reaction is:\n            O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ ⇌ 4OH⁻(aq) ; E° = +0.40 V\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the standard reduction potential in basic solution (+0.40 V) is significantly lower than in acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the statement:** \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** Kinetics is about the rate of a reaction, which depends on factors like activation energy and reaction mechanism, not just the thermodynamic favorability (E°). A reaction can be thermodynamically favorable (high E°) but kinetically slow if it has a high activation energy.\n    *   **Analysis:** The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is a famously sluggish or slow process. This is because:\n        *   It requires the breaking of a strong O=O double bond.\n        *   It is a multi-electron transfer process (four electrons), which rarely occurs in a single concerted step. The reaction proceeds through intermediates, and some of these steps have high activation barriers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the high activation energy associated with its reduction, oxygen reacts **slower** kinetically. This is observed as a large overpotential required to drive the reaction at a practical rate, even in acidic solutions where it is a strong oxidant thermodynamically.\n\n3.  **Combine the results.**\n    *   From Step 1, the first blank is **weaker**.\n    *   From Step 2, the second blank is **slower**.\n    *   Therefore, the correct combination of words is \"weaker – slower\".\n\n4.  **Match with the options.**\n    *   A) stronger – slower\n    *   B) weaker – faster\n    *   C) weaker - slower\n    *   D) stronger – faster\n    *   The combination \"weaker - slower\" corresponds to option C.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<C>>>"
