    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand C3h Symmetry\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis**: A three-fold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n2.  A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n\nThe presence of both a C3 axis and a σh plane implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis. The complete set of symmetry operations for the C3h point group is {E, C3, C3², σh, S3, S3⁵}.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Molecule\n\nLet's examine the 3D structure and symmetry of each molecule.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane formed by the three oxygen atoms.\n    *   However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are bulky. To minimize steric repulsion between them, they will twist out of the B(O)3 plane into a \"propeller-like\" conformation.\n    *   This propeller arrangement maintains the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). A plane containing the B and O atoms cannot be a mirror plane because the twisted isopropyl groups are not reflected onto themselves.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of the most stable conformer of triisopropyl borate is C3, not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, disc-shaped molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core to which three anhydride-like rings are fused. The entire molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the structure, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   Since the molecule is perfectly planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Now, we check for higher symmetry (like D3h). A D3h point group would require three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. The fused anhydride units (-CO-O-CO-) are asymmetric in the plane, meaning a 180° rotation around an axis in the molecular plane would not superimpose the molecule on itself. The placement of the oxygen atom in each anhydride ring breaks this C2 symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but lacks the additional symmetry elements (C2 axes perpendicular to C3, or σv planes) needed for a higher symmetry group. Therefore, its point group is exactly **C3h**.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (also known as mellitic trianhydride)**\n\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has a central benzene ring with three anhydride rings fused to it. It is also a planar molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center, perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   Being planar, it has a σh plane (the molecular plane). So, it does possess the symmetry elements of the C3h group.\n    *   Let's check for higher symmetry. Unlike molecule B, this molecule is more symmetric. It possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and passing through the center of the molecule. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane means the molecule's point group is D3h. While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h (C3h is a subgroup of D3h), it is a higher order point group. Typically, such questions ask for the molecule whose highest-order point group is the one specified.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n\n*   **Structure:** A cage-like bicyclic amine with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. A plane halfway between the N and C bridgeheads would cut through the C-C bonds of the ethylene bridges and would not reflect the top half of the molecule onto the bottom half.\n    *   The molecule does possess three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group of quinuclidine is C3v. It lacks the required σh plane for C3h symmetry.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   A) triisopropyl borate: **C3**\n*   B) triphenyleno[...]trifuran[...]hexaone: **C3h**\n*   C) benzo[...]trifuran[...]hexaone: **D3h**\n*   D) quinuclidine: **C3v**\n\nThe only molecule whose point group is precisely C3h is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
