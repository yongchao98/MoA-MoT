    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is equivalent to finding the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n*   Goal: Calculate `M_total_1 / M_total_2`\n*   `M_total_1 = M_1a + M_1b` (sum of masses in system 1)\n*   `M_total_2 = M_2a + M_2b` (sum of masses in system 2)\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1a (K_1a) = 10 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 1b (K_1b) = 5 km/s\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2a (K_2a) = 15 km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star 2b (K_2b) = 10 km/s\n\n**3. Identify Key Physics Principles and Formulas**\n\nThe problem involves a spectroscopic eclipsing binary system. The total mass of such a system can be determined from the orbital period and the radial velocities of its component stars.\n\nThe relevant formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, relates the total mass (M1 + M2) to the period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) of the relative orbit:\n`M1 + M2 = (4 * π² * a³) / (G * P²)`\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe do not know the semi-major axis `a` directly, but we can relate it to the observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2). For circular orbits, the orbital speeds (v1, v2) are given by:\n`v1 = 2π * a1 / P` and `v2 = 2π * a2 / P`\nwhere `a = a1 + a2`.\n\nThe observed radial velocity amplitudes (K1, K2) are the orbital speeds projected onto our line of sight:\n`K1 = v1 * sin(i)` and `K2 = v2 * sin(i)`\nwhere `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n`a = a1 + a2 = (P / (2π)) * (v1 + v2) = (P / (2π * sin(i))) * (K1 + K2)`\n\nSubstituting this expression for `a` into Kepler's law for the total mass:\n`M1 + M2 = (1 / (2πG)) * (P * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i))`\n\n**4. List All Careful Points (Assumptions)**\n\n*   **Eclipsing System:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. Eclipses can only occur when the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly.\n*   **Sinusoidal Variations:** The problem mentions that the radial velocities show \"sinusoidal variations.\" This implies that the orbits of the stars are approximately circular. The formulas used here are for circular orbits.\n*   **Units:** We are asked for a ratio of masses. As long as we use consistent units for both systems (years for period, km/s for velocity), the constants (like `2πG`) and unit conversion factors will cancel out.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nBased on the simplified formula (`sin(i)=1`), the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its radial velocity amplitudes:\n`M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³`\n\n*   **For System 1:**\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   K_sum_1 = K_1a + K_1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   `M_total_1 ∝ P1 * (K_sum_1)³ = 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750` (in proportional units)\n\n*   **For System 2:**\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_sum_2 = K_2a + K_2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   `M_total_2 ∝ P2 * (K_sum_2)³ = 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625` (in proportional units)\n\n*   **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = `M_total_1 / M_total_2`\n    *   Ratio = `(2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³)`\n    *   Ratio = `6750 / 15625`\n    *   To simplify, we can write it as: `2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³ = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125`\n    *   Ratio = `54 / 125 = 0.432`\n\n**6. Final Answer Determination**\nThe calculated factor is `0.432`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
