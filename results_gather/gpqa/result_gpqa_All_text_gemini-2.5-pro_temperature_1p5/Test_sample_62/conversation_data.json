    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Model and Energy Levels\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy `E` of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational energy and rotational energy. The energy levels are quantized and described by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy formula for a state `(v, J)` is:\n`E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J+1)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.054 x 10^-34 J·s`).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Initial and Final States\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state\". This is the state with the absolute lowest energy, which corresponds to the ground vibrational and rotational levels: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". To find this state, we must consider the possible transitions from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)`. For a photon to be absorbed, its energy must exactly match the energy difference `ΔE` between the initial and final states.\n    There are two main types of transitions to consider:\n    1.  **Pure Rotational Transition:** The vibrational state does not change (`Δv=0`), but the rotational state does (`ΔJ=+1`). The final state would be `(v=0, J=1)`.\n    2.  **Ro-Vibrational Transition:** Both vibrational and rotational states change. The selection rules for photon absorption are `Δv=+1` and `ΔJ=±1`. Starting from `J=0`, the only possibility is `ΔJ=+1`. The final state would be `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Change (ΔE) for Each Possible Transition\n\nTo determine which transition corresponds to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\", we need to compare the energy of the two potential final states.\n\n*   **Case 1: Pure Rotational Transition `(v=0, J=0) -> (v=0, J=1)`**\n    `E_final = E(0, 1) = (1/2)ħω + B*1(1+1) = (1/2)ħω + 2B`\n    `ΔE_rot = E(0, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(1/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = 2B`\n\n*   **Case 2: Ro-Vibrational Transition `(v=0, J=0) -> (v=1, J=1)`**\n    `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n    `ΔE_rovib = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0) = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B`\n\nTypically, the rotational energy spacing (`2B`) is much smaller than the vibrational energy spacing (`ħω`). This means the pure rotational transition requires significantly less energy. Therefore, the true \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is `(v=0, J=1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Necessary Values and Photon Momentum\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values to confirm our assumption and find the photon momentum `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n**Constants and Given Values:**\n*   `Mx = 20 amu`, `My = 2 amu`. (1 amu ≈ 1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg)\n*   `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n*   `ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s`\n*   `ħ = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n*   `c = 3 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Reduced Mass (`μ`):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 amu = (20/11) amu`\n    `μ ≈ (1.818) * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n2.  **Moment of Inertia (`I`):**\n    `I = μR² = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n    `I = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) = 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n3.  **Rotational Energy Term (`2B`):**\n    `2B = 2 * (ħ² / 2I) = ħ² / I`\n    `2B = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.2 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n4.  **Vibrational Energy Term (`ħω`):**\n    `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\n**Momentum Calculation for Both Cases:**\n*   **Photon for Rotational Transition:** `p_rot = ΔE_rot / c = (2B) / c ≈ (9.2 x 10⁻²³ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 3.1 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`\n*   **Photon for Ro-Vibrational Transition:** `p_rovib = ΔE_rovib / c = (ħω + 2B) / c ≈ (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\n### Step 5: Final Analysis and Answer Selection\n\nComparing our calculated momenta with the given options:\nA) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nD) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated momentum for the pure rotational transition (`~3.1 x 10⁻³¹ N·s`) does not match any option. However, the momentum for the ro-vibrational transition (`~1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`) is a perfect match for option A.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the wording \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" strictly implies the pure rotational transition, the numerical options provided force us to conclude that the question is asking for the momentum required for the lowest-energy *ro-vibrational* transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0` to `v=1, J=1`). The energy for this transition is `ΔE = ħω + 2B`, which is dominated by the `ħω` term.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n`p = ΔE / c ≈ ħω / c`\n`p = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) = 1.405 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
