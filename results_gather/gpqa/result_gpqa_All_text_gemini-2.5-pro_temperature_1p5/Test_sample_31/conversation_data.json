    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the energy of the nucleus.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Nucleus and its Mass Number**\nThe problem specifies the nucleus as \"X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons\".\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it contains 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons).\n*   A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\nSo, the nucleus in question is Lithium-6 (⁶Li), which has 6 nucleons.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe total relativistic energy (E) is given by the formula E = γm₀c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, and m₀c² is the rest energy.\n*   The speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c.\n*   The Lorentz factor γ is calculated as:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Substituting the value of v:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n*   Now, we calculate the values:\n    0.96² = 0.9216\n    1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\n    √0.0784 = 0.28\n*   Therefore, the Lorentz factor is:\n    γ = 1 / 0.28\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\nThe rest energy is E₀ = m₀c². We need to find the rest mass m₀ of the ⁶Li nucleus. For physics problems of this type, a common and effective approximation is to calculate the mass of the nucleus by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon. We have to decide whether to use the proton mass or the neutron mass. Let's test the approximation using the neutron mass (m_n), as this often provides a good estimate and is a common convention in such problems.\n*   The mass of a neutron is approximately m_n ≈ 939.57 MeV/c².\n*   The rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus is approximated as: m₀ ≈ 6 * m_n.\n*   The rest energy E₀ is then:\n    E₀ ≈ 6 * (m_n * c²) = 6 * 939.57 MeV = 5637.42 MeV\n*   Since the answer choices are in GeV (Giga-electron-volts), we convert MeV to GeV:\n    E₀ ≈ 5637.42 MeV / 1000 = 5.63742 GeV\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nNow we combine the Lorentz factor and the rest energy to find the total energy.\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E = (1 / 0.28) * 5.63742 GeV\n*   E ≈ 3.571428 * 5.63742 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.1336 GeV\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Given Options**\nThe calculated total energy is approximately 20.1336 GeV. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nOur calculated value of 20.1336 GeV is extremely close to option C (20.132 GeV). The tiny difference is due to the rounding of physical constants. This confirms that the chosen method of approximation is the one intended for this question.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Nucleus Identification:** Correctly determining the mass number (A=6) is the first critical step.\n*   **Lorentz Factor:** The calculation for γ is straightforward but requires precision. The value v=0.96c conveniently leads to γ = 1/0.28.\n*   **Rest Mass Approximation:** The most critical part is choosing the correct model for the rest mass. While the true mass involves binding energy, for multiple-choice questions, it's common to use a simpler approximation (like A * m_n). Comparing the result with the options confirms the correct approach.\n*   **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent. The final answer is required in GeV, so the rest energy must be converted from MeV to GeV before the final calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
