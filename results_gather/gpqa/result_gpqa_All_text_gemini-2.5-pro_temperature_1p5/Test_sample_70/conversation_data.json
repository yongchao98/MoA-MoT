    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq,4 / T_eq,2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Assumptions\n*   **System:** Five exoplanets orbiting the same star. This is a crucial point because it means the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all planets.\n*   **Orbital Periods (T):** The periods are in a ratio T₁:T₂:T₃:T₄:T₅ = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n*   **Albedo (A):** All planets have the same albedo. This means the factor (1-A), which represents the fraction of absorbed stellar energy, is constant for all planets.\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** This is the theoretical temperature a planet would have when the energy it absorbs from its star is perfectly balanced by the energy it radiates back into space.\n\n### Step 3: The Physics - Relating Temperature to Orbital Radius\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between absorbed and radiated energy. The formula is:\n`T_eq = [ L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * r²) ]^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n*   `L` is the star's luminosity.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   `r` is the orbital radius (distance from the star).\n\nSince `L`, `A`, and all the physical constants (`16, π, σ`) are the same for both planets, we can see the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital radius:\n`T_eq ∝ (1 / r²)^(1/4)`\n`T_eq ∝ r^(-2/4)`\n`T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2)`\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.\n\n### Step 4: The Physics - Relating Orbital Radius to Orbital Period\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`T`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`r` for a circular orbit).\n`T² ∝ r³`\nTo find how `r` depends on `T`, we can rearrange this relationship:\n`r³ ∝ T²`\n`r ∝ T^(2/3)`\n\nThis means the orbital radius is proportional to the orbital period raised to the power of 2/3.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Relationships\nNow we can combine the results from Step 3 and Step 4 to find a direct relationship between equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) and orbital period (`T`).\nWe know `T_eq ∝ r^(-1/2)` and `r ∝ T^(2/3)`.\nSubstitute the expression for `r` into the temperature relation:\n`T_eq ∝ (T^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n`T_eq ∝ T^((2/3) * (-1/2))`\n`T_eq ∝ T^(-1/3)`\n\nSo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Ratio\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq,4 / T_eq,2`. Using the relationship from Step 5:\n`T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (T₄ / T₂)^(-1/3)`\nThis is the same as:\n`T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (T₂ / T₄)^(1/3)`\n\nFrom the given period ratios, we have:\n*   `T₂` corresponds to the ratio value of `2`.\n*   `T₄` corresponds to the ratio value of `3.5`.\n\nSo, the ratio of the periods `T₂ / T₄` is `2 / 3.5`.\nNow, we plug this into our equation:\n`T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = (1 / 1.75)^(1/3)`\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n`1 / 1.75 ≈ 0.5714`\nSo, we need to find the cube root of `0.5714`:\n`(0.5714)^(1/3)`\n\nWe can test the options:\nA) `0.75³ ≈ 0.42`\nB) `0.83³ ≈ 0.57`\nC) `0.69³ ≈ 0.33`\nD) `0.57³ ≈ 0.19`\n\nThe value of `0.83³` is approximately `0.57`, which matches our required calculation.\nTherefore, `T_eq,4 / T_eq,2 ≈ 0.83`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
