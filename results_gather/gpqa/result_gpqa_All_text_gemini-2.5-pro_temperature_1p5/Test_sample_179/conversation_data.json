    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum energy of the system.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles.\n*   Charge of each particle: `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge.\n*   Mass: Negligible (this implies we only need to consider electrostatic potential energy, not kinetic or gravitational energy).\n*   Configuration:\n    *   One particle (the 13th) is fixed at a point P.\n    *   The other 12 particles are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n*   Goal: Find the *minimum total potential energy* of this isolated system.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Total Potential Energy\nThe total electrostatic potential energy (`U_total`) of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can split the total energy into two components:\n1.  **`U_center-sphere`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_sphere-sphere`**: The potential energy from the mutual interaction among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nSo, `U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate `U_center-sphere`\nThe central charge `q` is at a fixed distance `R` from each of the 12 charges `q` on the sphere. The potential energy of one such pair is `k * q^2 / R`. Since there are 12 such pairs, this component of the energy is:\n`U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\nThis value is constant because the positions are fixed relative to the center.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Minimum `U_sphere-sphere`\nThe 12 charges on the sphere will arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion. This is a well-known problem (the Thomson problem for N=12). The minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere.\n\nThe potential energy `U_sphere-sphere` is the sum over all pairs of these 12 charges:\n`U_sphere-sphere = Σ (1 ≤ i < j ≤ 12) k * q^2 / r_ij`, where `r_ij` is the distance between charge `i` and charge `j`.\n\nThis can be written as: `U_sphere-sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * S'`, where `S'` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of all `R/r_ij` for the icosahedron configuration.\n\nIn an icosahedron, from any given vertex, there are:\n*   5 nearest neighbors at a distance `a` (the edge length of the icosahedron).\n*   5 next-nearest neighbors at a distance `b`.\n*   1 diametrically opposite vertex at a distance `d = 2R`.\n\nThe total number of pairs is `12 * 11 / 2 = 66`. These pairs are distributed as:\n*   `30` pairs at distance `a`.\n*   `30` pairs at distance `b`.\n*   `6` pairs at distance `d = 2R`.\n\nSo, the sum `S'` can be written as:\n`S' = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R/b) + 6 * (R/(2R)) = 30 * (R/a) + 30 * (R/b) + 3`\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Geometric Ratios `R/a` and `R/b`\nFor a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R:\n*   The ratio of the radius to the edge length `a` is `R/a = sqrt( (5-sqrt(5))/8 )`.\n*   The ratio of the radius to the next-neighbor distance `b` is `R/b = sqrt( (5+sqrt(5))/8 )`.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for `S'`:\n`S' = 30 * [sqrt((5-sqrt(5))/8) + sqrt((5+sqrt(5))/8)] + 3`\nThis expression can be simplified algebraically to `S' = 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3`.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Total Minimum Energy\nNow we combine the energy components:\n`U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 / R) * S'`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + S')`\nSubstituting the derived expression for `S'`:\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3)`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (15 + 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)))`\n\n### Step 7: Substitute Numerical Values\nThe constants are:\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602177 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q = 2e ≈ 3.204354 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236068`\n\nFirst, calculate the energy factor `(k * q^2 / R)`:\n`q^2 = (2e)^2 = 4e^2 ≈ 4 * (1.602177 × 10^-19)^2 ≈ 1.02679 × 10^-37 C²`\n`(k * q^2 / R) ≈ (8.98755 × 10^9 * 1.02679 × 10^-37) / 2`\n`≈ 4.61425 × 10^-28 J`\n\nNext, calculate the dimensionless sum `(15 + 15 * sqrt(5 + 2*sqrt(5)))`:\n`5 + 2*sqrt(5) ≈ 5 + 2 * 2.236068 = 9.472136`\n`sqrt(9.472136) ≈ 3.07768`\n`Dimensionless sum ≈ 15 + 15 * 3.07768 = 15 + 46.1652 = 61.1652`\n\nFinally, multiply the two parts:\n`U_total ≈ (4.61425 × 10^-28 J) * 61.1652`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8220 × 10^-26 J`\n\nThis value, when rounded to three decimals, is `2.822 x 10^-26 J`.\n\n### Step 8: Final Answer Selection\nComparing our calculated result with the given options:\nA) 2.822 x 10^-26\nB) 5.645 x 10^-26\nC) 122.330\nD) 7.056 x 10^-27\n\nThe calculated value `2.822 x 10^-26 J` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
