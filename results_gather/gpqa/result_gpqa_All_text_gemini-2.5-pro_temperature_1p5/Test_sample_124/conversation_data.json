    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Identify the Physical System and Potential**\nThe system is a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential given by:\n$V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\nIn Cartesian coordinates, this potential can be written as $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This shows that the potential is separable into three independent 1D harmonic oscillators, one for each coordinate axis.\n\n**2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues**\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system separates into three identical equations, one for each dimension (x, y, z).\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is:\n$E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies from the three independent dimensions:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nTo simplify, we define a principal quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_N = (N + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $N = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$\n\n**3. Identify the Third Excited State**\nThe energy levels are ordered by the value of $N$.\n*   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $N=0$.\n    *   $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $N=1$.\n    *   $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=2$.\n    *   $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $N=3$.\n    *   $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_N$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = N$. We need to find the degeneracy for the third excited state, which means we need to find the number of combinations for $N=3$.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   **Type 1: One quantum number is 3, others are 0.**\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)\n    *   This gives **3** possible states.\n*   **Type 2: One quantum number is 2, another is 1, and the last is 0.**\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)\n    *   These are all the permutations of (2,1,0), which is $3! = 6$. This gives **6** possible states.\n*   **Type 3: All three quantum numbers are 1.**\n    *   (1, 1, 1)\n    *   This gives **1** possible state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for the third excited state is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = **10**.\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\nWe have found that the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and its degeneracy is 10. Let's check the options:\nA) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ - Incorrect energy expression (this is for a particle in a box).\nB) $11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ - Incorrect energy expression.\nC) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3$ - Correct energy, but incorrect degeneracy. (Degeneracy of 3 corresponds to the first excited state, N=1).\nD) $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10$ - Correct energy and correct degeneracy.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<D>>>"
