    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Provided Information**\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two isomers with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum of this mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The integration ratios (1:1 for aromatic, 2:1:1 for aliphatic) refer to the total protons from *both* compounds in the mixture contributing to those signals.\n**Careful Point 2:** The splitting pattern is crucial. The presence of only singlets in the aliphatic region is a major clue.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four given options.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, giving a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons, giving a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound gives a quartet and a triplet. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds**. This eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. They will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry (C2v).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Although they are adjacent, coupled equivalent protons appear as a singlet. So, they give **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   Total aliphatic signals: Two singlets in a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry (Cs).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are not equivalent. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in **two singlets (each 1H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. It gives **one singlet (3H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. It gives **one singlet (3H)**.\n        *   Total aliphatic signals: Three singlets in a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1:1 Mixtures based on the Individual Spectra**\n\nNow, let's test the remaining options (A, C, and D) by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio (assuming no overlap). This contradicts the data of \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio (assuming no overlap). This contradicts the data of \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**.\n        *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture, each singlet represents 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives two separate singlets, each for 6 methyl protons.\n        *   In total, the mixture will show **three singlets**.\n        *   The integrations will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that produces the 1H NMR spectrum described in the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>"
