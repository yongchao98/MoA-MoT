    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2**\n    *   **λ1**: This is the mean free path of the *gas molecules themselves*. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the *electrons from the beam*. It represents the average distance an electron travels before it scatters off a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the General Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general form is:\n    `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n\n3.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n    *   In a gas, all particles are moving. To account for the relative motion between the projectile molecule and the target molecules, the standard kinetic theory of gases introduces a factor of `√2` into the denominator.\n    *   The formula for λ1 is: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` = the collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n4.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule MFP)**\n    *   In this scenario, the projectiles are electrons accelerated to an extremely high energy (1000 kV). Their speed approaches the speed of light and is vastly greater than the thermal speed of the gas molecules.\n    *   Because the electrons are so much faster than the gas molecules, the gas molecules can be treated as stationary targets.\n    *   When the targets are stationary, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is: `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as for λ1).\n        *   `σ_eg` = the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    `λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]`\n    `λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)`\n    `λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)`\n\n6.  **Analyze the Critical Factors in the Ratio**\n    There are two key factors that determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1:\n\n    *   **Factor 1: Relative Motion (`√2`)**\n        Even if the collision cross-sections were identical (i.e., `σ_gg = σ_eg`), the fact that the gas molecules are stationary targets for the fast electrons removes the `√2` from the denominator. This alone would make `λ2 = √2 * λ1`. Since `√2 ≈ 1.414`, this factor makes λ2 significantly larger than λ1.\n\n    *   **Factor 2: Collision Cross-Section (`σ_gg / σ_eg`)**\n        *   `σ_gg` represents the kinetic cross-section between two molecules. It's determined by their physical size (diameter `d`), roughly `σ_gg ≈ πd²`.\n        *   `σ_eg` represents the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. An electron is a point-like particle. An atom is mostly empty space. A high-energy (1000 kV) electron will only be significantly scattered if it passes very close to the atomic nucleus or an inner-shell electron. It can easily pass through the outer electron cloud without significant interaction. Therefore, the effective target area an atom presents to a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is much *smaller* than the kinetic area it presents to another molecule (`σ_gg`).\n        *   This means the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number greater than 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**\n    Combining both factors, the ratio `λ2 / λ1` is the product of `√2` (which is ~1.414) and a factor `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` (which is > 1).\n    Therefore, `λ2 / λ1 > √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n    This means `λ2` must be significantly larger than `1.414 * λ1`. Now we check the given options:\n    A) λ2 < λ1 -> False.\n    B) λ2 = λ1 -> False.\n    C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> False, because our result `λ2 > 1.414*λ1` is outside this range.\n    D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **True**. Since we concluded that `λ2 > 1.414*λ1`, it is certainly true that `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The primary difference arises from the nature of the projectiles: a molecule of comparable mass and speed versus a tiny, extremely high-velocity electron.\n*   The high energy (1000 kV) of the electron is crucial. For low-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section could be much larger, but for highly penetrating radiation like a 1 MeV electron beam, the target atoms are mostly transparent.\n*   The problem relies on understanding the two physical effects: the statistical effect of relative motion (the `√2` factor) and the physical effect of different interaction cross-sections. Both effects contribute to making λ2 larger than λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
