    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle: The Memoryless Property of Radioactive Decay**\n    *   Radioactive decay is a random process governed by exponential decay. A fundamental concept of this process is that it is \"memoryless\".\n    *   This means the probability that an unstable nucleus will decay in a given time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. An atom that has survived for 50 minutes has the exact same probability of decaying in the next minute as a brand-new atom of the same type.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The information \"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is crucial because it establishes that we are still observing the same atom, but it does *not* alter its future decay probability. We can essentially reset our clock to zero at the 50-minute mark and ask: what is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes?\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model**\n    *   Let $P_d(t)$ be the probability that the atom decays within a time interval of duration $t$.\n    *   Let $P_s(t)$ be the probability that the atom survives (does not decay) for a duration of $t$.\n    *   These are related by $P_d(t) + P_s(t) = 1$.\n    *   The survival probability follows the exponential law: $P_s(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $\\lambda$ is the decay constant.\n    *   Therefore, the decay probability is $P_d(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Find the Survival Rate**\n    *   We are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   So, $P_d(100) = 0.32$.\n    *   This allows us to find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n        $P_s(100) = 1 - P_d(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68$.\n    *   From our formula, this means: $e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We don't need to calculate the decay constant $\\lambda$ itself. We can work directly with the value of $e^{-100\\lambda}$, which is the probability of surviving 100 minutes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability**\n    *   Because of the memoryless property discussed in Step 1, the probability that the atom (which has already survived 50 minutes) will decay in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom will decay within a 150-minute period.\n    *   We need to calculate $P_d(150) = 1 - P_s(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}$.\n    *   We can find the value of $e^{-150\\lambda}$ using the value we found in Step 3. We use the properties of exponents:\n        $e^{-150\\lambda} = e^{-100\\lambda \\cdot (150/100)} = (e^{-100\\lambda})^{1.5}$\n    *   Now substitute the known value:\n        $P_s(150) = (0.68)^{1.5}$\n    *   Let's calculate this:\n        $P_s(150) = (0.68)^{1.5} = 0.68 \\times \\sqrt{0.68}$\n        $\\sqrt{0.68} \\approx 0.8246$\n        $P_s(150) \\approx 0.68 \\times 0.8246 \\approx 0.5607$\n    *   This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. The question asks for the probability of it *decaying*.\n        $P_d(150) = 1 - P_s(150) \\approx 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393$.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   The calculated probability is 0.4393, which corresponds to 43.93%.\n    *   Looking at the choices:\n        A) 40%\n        B) 52%\n        C) 48%\n        D) 44%\n    *   The value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
