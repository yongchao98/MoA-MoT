    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a powerful reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new stereocenter (C3). Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, the products will be a pair of diastereomers.\n    *   Product 1A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   Product 1B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** The reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomeric alcohols.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of the two).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions. In total, we have **five** distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n*   **Structurally different compounds** (like those from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different properties and will be separated.\n\nLet's group the products based on how they will behave:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction II are the meso-diol and the racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the racemic pair. The two enantiomers in the racemic pair will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the number of unique stereoisomers in our mixture: five.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Peak 2 - diastereomer of 1, so it separates)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3 - achiral, but chemically different from all others, so it separates)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5 - enantiomer of 4, separates on a chiral column)\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct (even the meso compound is distinct from the chiral ones), a chiral HPLC column should resolve them all, assuming ideal conditions.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
