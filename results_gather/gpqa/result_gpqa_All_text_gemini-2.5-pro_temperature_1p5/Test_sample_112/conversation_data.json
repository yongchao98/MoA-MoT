    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The peak is exceptionally broad due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that forms dimers. While alcohols also show a broad O-H peak, it is typically centered higher (around 3300 cm⁻¹) and the combination with the other peaks points away from an alcohol.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is located in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O group in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated (contains an alkene).\n\n**Careful Point:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch is powerful evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. The additional C=C peak indicates it's an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **A fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a plausible chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most common and stable fragment with this mass is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment provides strong confirmation that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Chemical Formulas**\n\n1.  **Functional Groups Identified:** From the combined spectral data, we know the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n2.  **Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This fact immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n3.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** We are left with options B (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2). We can differentiate between them by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each formula. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   **DoU Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   Our identified functional groups require at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU = 2.\n    *   **For option B (C6H12O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n        A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of a saturated carboxylic acid. This contradicts the evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **For option D (C6H10O2):**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n        A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll the provided spectral data consistently point to an unsaturated carboxylic acid with six carbons. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains two oxygens and has the required degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
