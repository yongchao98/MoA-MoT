    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of various substituted benzene compounds. The goal is to arrange these compounds in order of the increasing weight fraction (percentage) of the para-isomer formed as the product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nSubstituents on a benzene ring determine the position of the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+). We classify them as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens. They direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. For these compounds, the para-isomer is formed in very small, often trace, amounts.\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 (methyl) group is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 (ester) group is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl (chloro) group is a halogen. It is **deactivating but ortho, para-directing**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 (nitro) group is a very strong electron-withdrawing group. It is a **strongly deactivating, meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 (ethyl) group is an alkyl group. It is an **activating, ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH (carboxyl) group is a carbonyl-containing group. It is a **deactivating, meta-director**.\n\n**Step 3: Separate into Two Groups**\nBased on the classification, we can separate the compounds into two groups: those that will produce very little para-isomer and those that will produce a lot.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield (meta-directors):** 2 (Ethyl benzoate), 4 (Nitrobenzene), 6 (Benzoic acid).\n*   **High Para Yield (ortho, para-directors):** 1 (Toluene), 3 (Chlorobenzene), 5 (Ethylbenzene).\n\nThis means the final sequence will have compounds 2, 4, and 6 at the beginning (lowest yield) and compounds 1, 3, and 5 at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 4: Order the Compounds with Low Para Yield (2, 4, 6)**\nFor meta-directors, the amount of the minor para-product formed is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group makes the ortho and para positions even more electron-poor, thus favoring the meta position more strongly and producing even less para-isomer.\nThe deactivating strength of these groups follows the order:\n-NO2 (strongest) > -COOH > -COOC2H5 (weakest of the three)\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield for -NO2 < Yield for -COOH < Yield for -COOC2H5\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 5: Order the Compounds with High Para Yield (1, 3, 5)**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This ratio is influenced by electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it harder for the incoming bromine to attack the adjacent ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of substitution at the less crowded para position. Thus, the para yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5** (Typical para yields: Toluene ~62%, Ethylbenzene ~66%)\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom is a halogen. While it directs ortho/para due to its lone pairs (resonance effect), it strongly withdraws electrons inductively (-I effect). This inductive effect is strongest at the nearby ortho positions, making them significantly more deactivated than the distant para position. This strong electronic preference for the para position results in a very high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   Typical para yield for Chlorobenzene is ~89%.\n\n*   Combining these observations, the order of increasing para yield for this group is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene.\n    *   Substance order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders to Get the Final Answer**\nNow, we combine the two ordered subgroups. The compounds with low para yield come before the compounds with high para yield.\n\n(Order for low-yield group) < (Order for high-yield group)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
