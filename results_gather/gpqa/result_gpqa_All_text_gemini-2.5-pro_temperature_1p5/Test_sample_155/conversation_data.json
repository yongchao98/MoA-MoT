    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step sequence: 1) mCPBA, followed by 2) aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** There's a useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions: **\"TAM\"** which stands for **T**rans + **A**nti -> **M**eso.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** According to this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene yields a meso compound. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers. In this case, the product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**. It is a single substance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction sequence is the same: anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** Another useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"** which stands for **C**is + **A**nti -> **R**acemic.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Products and Analyze the Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **E1**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **E2**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow let's determine the relationship between these three molecules:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a **diastereomer** of **E2**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\nA standard, achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like E1 and E2, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like M and the pair (E1, E2), have different physical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by an achiral column and will elute at different times.\n\nBased on this, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show:\n*   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n*   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n\nTotal peaks observed: **2**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like E1 and E2, will form transient diastereomeric complexes with the chiral stationary phase. These complexes have different stabilities, causing E1 and E2 to elute at different times, resulting in two separate peaks.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like M and (E1, E2), are already separable on any column, including a chiral one.\n\nBased on this, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show three separate peaks for the three distinct molecules in the mixture:\n*   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n*   **Peak 2:** One enantiomer (e.g., E1).\n*   **Peak 3:** The other enantiomer (e.g., E2).\n\nTotal peaks observed: **3**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
