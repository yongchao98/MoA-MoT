    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the structure of the starting compound.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DBE of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DBE=4) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2), suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1), which must be the aldehyde proton. This confirms the **-CH2-CHO** (acetaldehyde/ethanal) fragment. The chemical shift is appropriate for a benzylic -CH2- group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The upfield chemical shifts suggest the ring is substituted with a strong electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H in this region strongly suggests a primary amine group (**-NH2**). The -NH2 group is a strong EDG, consistent with the aromatic proton shifts.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    The pieces are a para-disubstituted benzene ring, with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group as the two substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (or 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal).\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4(ring) + NH2 + C2H3O(-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This is correct.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Sequence.**\n\nThe starting material for the reactions is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n```\n      O\n     //\n    C - CH2 - [Benzene Ring] - NH2\n   /\n  H\n```\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n    *   This is a two-step sequence for the conversion of a primary aromatic amine to a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (NaNO2, HCl): Diazotization. The -NH2 group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   Step 2 (H2O): Hydrolysis. The diazonium group is replaced by an -OH group, releasing N2 gas.\n    *   The product of these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n        C - CH2 - [Benzene Ring] - OH\n       /\n      H\n    ```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   This reagent set provides a strong base (KOH) and heat. The starting material for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This molecule possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**. The term \"heat\" implies that the reaction will proceed past the initial aldol addition to the final dehydrated (condensation) product.\n\n**3. Mechanism of the Aldol Condensation.**\n*   **Step 3a: Aldol Addition.**\n    1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate: `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]`(-).\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    3.  Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product. Let's trace the carbons to determine the structure of this intermediate.\n        *   Nucleophile part: `(HO-C6H4)-CH(CHO)-`\n        *   Electrophile part: `-CH(OH)-CH2-(C6H4-OH)`\n        *   Addition Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`\n        *   Numbering the main chain (butanal): `(HO-C6H4)-(C4)H2-(C3)H(OH)-(C2)H(C6H4-OH)-(C1)HO`.\n        *   The IUPAC name is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Dehydration (Condensation).**\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product (the compound in Option D) undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule).\n    *   The base removes a proton from the alpha-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group is eliminated from the beta-carbon (C3).\n    *   Addition Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-(C4)-CH(OH)-(C3)-CH(C6H4-OH)-(C2)-CHO(C1)`\n    *   Elimination of H from C2 and OH from C3 forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   Condensation Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-(C4)-CH=(C3)-C(C6H4-OH)-(C2)-CHO(C1)`\n    *   Let's name this final product. The parent chain is a but-2-enal. It has a (4-hydroxyphenyl) substituent on C2 and a (4-hydroxyphenyl) substituent on C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via diazotization/hydrolysis to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. While the initial addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D), the application of heat drives the reaction to completion via dehydration, forming the more stable, conjugated final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal (Option A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
