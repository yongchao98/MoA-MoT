    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a substituted cyclohexanone, which can act as a nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base, ideal for forming enolates.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** The combination of a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and a base points to a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Enolate Formation (Careful Point: Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group), at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is substituted with both an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon. It has **no α-protons** and cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) will unambiguously deprotonate the ketone at the C6 position. This regioselectivity is not a matter of kinetic vs. thermodynamic control; it is the only possible site for enolate formation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed has its nucleophilic character at C6.\n    *   This C6 nucleophile will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   After protonation during the workup step, the side chain `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` is attached to C6.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To compare with the options, we must name this product according to IUPAC conventions where the propanoate is the parent chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`. A substituted cyclohexyl group is attached at position 3 of this chain.\n    *   Let's number the cyclohexyl ring substituent, starting from the point of attachment as C1. This C1 corresponds to the original C6 of the ketone.\n        *   At C1 (original C6): There is a methyl group.\n        *   At C2 (original C1): There is the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   At C3 (original C2): There is an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting it together, the name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the structure for A in options A and C. Options B and D propose a different connectivity (a cyclohexan-4-one), which is not possible via this reaction mechanism.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The -NO₂ group makes the α-protons acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, another good Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael addition reaction**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Nucleophile Formation (Careful Point: Acidity):**\n    *   The α-protons on the carbon bearing the nitro group (C1 of 1-nitropropane) are significantly acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   KOH is a strong enough base to deprotonate this carbon, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion, `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`. This will be the nucleophile.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom of the C=C double bond that is further from the -CN group).\n    *   The nucleophile `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻` attacks the `CH` of the `CH₃-CH=` part of the nitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate anion is protonated by the solvent (water).\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Name of Product B:**\n    *   The final product structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The chain is: `C(1)N-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   This is a 6-carbon chain, so it is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the structure for B in options A and D. Options B and C describe an incorrect constitutional isomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Based on the analysis of the first reaction, Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This eliminates options B and D.\n*   Based on the analysis of the second reaction, Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This eliminates options B and C.\n*   The only option that correctly identifies both products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
