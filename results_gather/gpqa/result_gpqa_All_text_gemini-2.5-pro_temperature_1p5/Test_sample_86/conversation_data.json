    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the provided information**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two groups attached.\n*   **Atom Count:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n*   **Summary of deduced facts:** The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom (-X) and one other group that contains 2 carbon atoms and a carbonyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Propose possible structures**\n\nLet's figure out the substituent that contains 2 carbons and a C=O group.\n*   **Possibility 1: An acetyl group (-COCH₃).** This group has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. If this and a halogen are attached to a benzene ring, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits perfectly. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**.\n*   **Possibility 2: A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO).** This group also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl. If this and a halogen are attached to a benzene ring, the total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (formylmethyl) = 8. This also fits. The resulting compound would be a **halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the general patterns in the NMR options**\n\nLooking at the NMR options, options A and C show a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`.\n*   **What this pattern means:** Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   So, we can confidently assume our compound is a **para-isomer**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the para-isomers of our candidate structures**\n\n*   **Candidate 1: para-Haloacetophenone**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The ring is attached to a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing and is directly attached to the ring. This will strongly *deshield* the aromatic protons, moving their signals far downfield (to a high ppm value). We would expect the two doublets to be in the ~7.5 - 8.0 ppm range.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (3H):** There is a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Its typical chemical shift is around **2.1 - 2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets between 7.5-8.0 ppm (total 4H), and one singlet around 2.3 ppm (3H).\n\n*   **Candidate 2: para-Halo-phenylacetaldehyde**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded and gives a unique signal very far downfield, typically **9-10 ppm**. It will be a singlet (s) or a triplet (t).\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The methylene protons (-CH₂-) are in a benzylic position (next to the ring). Their signal would be around **3.5 - 4.0 ppm**. It would be a singlet (s) or a doublet (d).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The ring is attached to a halogen (-X) and a -CH₂CHO group. The group directly attached is the -CH₂-, which is not strongly electron-withdrawing. The electronic effect is insulated by the CH₂. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be much less deshielded than in Candidate 1. Their chemical shifts would be expected around **7.1 - 7.4 ppm**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the predictions with the given options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This has the aldehyde proton (9.9 ppm) and the methylene proton (3.7 ppm) signals that match Candidate 2 (para-Halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   **However**, the aromatic proton signals (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too far downfield. They do not match a ring substituted with a -CH₂- group. This option has an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   These chemical shifts and splitting patterns are not consistent with a di-substituted aromatic compound. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The aromatic signals (`7.8`, `7.6` ppm) are strongly deshielded, which is perfectly consistent with a ring directly attached to an electron-withdrawing acetyl group.\n    *   The aliphatic signal `2.3 (3H, s)` is a perfect match for a methyl ketone (-COCH₃).\n    *   This spectrum is a textbook match for **para-Haloacetophenone (Candidate 1)**. All features are consistent.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   These are not aromatic chemical shifts. Incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C is the only one that is fully consistent with a plausible structure (para-haloacetophenone) that meets all the criteria given in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>"
