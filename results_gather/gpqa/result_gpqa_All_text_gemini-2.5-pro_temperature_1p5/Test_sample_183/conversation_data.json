    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3 or -tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n*   -OEt is a strong activator and an ortho, para-director.\n*   -tBu is a weak activator and an ortho, para-director. It is very bulky.\n*   -NO2 is a strong deactivator and a meta-director.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene often requires a careful strategy, sometimes involving blocking groups or exploiting changes in directing effects of functional groups during the synthesis.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options based on Initial Steps**\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration of benzene (i), followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (iii). Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) do not work. Even on aniline, it is problematic as the amine reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst. So, Option D is incorrect.\n*   **Options A, B, C:** All start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride (i), forming tert-butylbenzene. This is a logical first step. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director.\n\n**3. Analyze the Core Synthetic Strategy**\n\nAchieving the 1,2,3-substitution pattern directly from tert-butylbenzene is difficult. Direct substitution on tert-butylbenzene would occur at the para (C4) and ortho (C2, C6) positions. To get a group at C3, a more complex strategy is needed. A common high-yield strategy for controlling regiochemistry is the use of a blocking group, typically a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which can be easily added and later removed.\n\nLet's look for a sequence that employs this strategy logically.\n\n*   **Option A and C:** They introduce the nitro group (ii) right after the tert-butyl group. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mostly the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group. To obtain an ortho relationship as needed for the final product, we would have to rely on the minor ortho-nitration product, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n*   **Option B:** This option starts with alkylation (i) followed by sulfonation (ii). This is the hallmark of a blocking group strategy. Let's analyze this path in detail.\n\n**4. Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis of Option B (and its implied logic)**\n\nThe listed order of reagents in the options can sometimes be confusing or contain typos. The key is to see if the *set* of reagents can form a logical and high-yield pathway to the product. Option B contains a very clever, known synthesis route.\n\n**The logical (rearranged) synthesis using the reagents from Option B:**\n\n1.  **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   This is the start of the sequence.\n\n2.  **Step (ii) Sulfonation (Blocking Step):** tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   The bulky t-Bu group directs the sulfonation to the para position, making this a high-yield step.\n\n3.  **Step (iii) Nitration:** 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   This is a critical step. Let's analyze the directing effects on 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n        *   The -tBu group at C4 is an activator and o,p-director, directing to C3 and C5 (its ortho positions).\n        *   The -SO3H group at C1 is a deactivator and m-director, also directing to C3 and C5 (its meta positions).\n    *   Since both groups direct to the same positions (C3 and C5), this nitration is highly regioselective and high-yield.\n\n4.  **Step (iv) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. 4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + Fe/HCl → **3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   The nitro group is reduced, which is a key step to later introduce the oxygen atom.\n\n5.  **Step (v) Diazotization:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt. 3-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2/HCl → **4-tert-butyl-3-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n6.  **Step (vii) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. ...diazonium salt + H3O+, H2O/Heat → **3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n7.  **Step (viii) Desulfonation (Removal of Blocking Group):** 3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + dilute H2SO4 → **2-tert-butylphenol**.\n    *   Heating with dilute acid removes the sulfonic acid group. The resulting molecule, with an -OH group and a -tBu group ortho to each other, is 2-tert-butylphenol. This is a clever, high-yield synthesis of this important intermediate.\n\n8.  **Step (ix) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** 2-tert-butylphenol + NaOH/EtBr → **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   The phenol is converted to the desired ethoxy ether.\n\n9.  **Step (vi) Final Nitration:** 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This final step introduces the required nitro group. The directing effects are complex (-OEt at C1 directs to C4/C6; -tBu at C2 directs to C3/C5). However, nitration at C3, which is ortho to the bulky t-butyl group, is required. While potentially yielding a mixture, this is the final step to achieve the target structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the order of reagents listed in option B (specifically steps vi-ix) is jumbled from a linear synthesis perspective, the collection of reagents in Option B corresponds to a known, logical, and high-yield multi-step synthesis. The other options either use reactions that would fail or would not lead to the correct isomer in high yield. The core of the correct synthesis is the elegant use of a sulfonic acid blocking group to synthesize the key intermediate, 2-tert-butylphenol, which is only possible with the reagents and initial steps outlined in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
