    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We can write the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` as:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n    The problem states that the star's properties (`T_star`, `R_star`) are the same for both planets and that the albedos are the same (`A_1 = A_2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving a simplified ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Data:** The semi-major axes (`a_1`, `a_2`) are not given directly. We must derive them from the radial velocity (RV) data.\n    The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ_max`) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (`K`) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)` where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\n    The radial velocity amplitude (`K`) for a star orbited by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)` where `M_p` is planet mass, `M_star` is star mass, `v_p` is planet's orbital speed, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    Since the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume an edge-on orbit, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    The planet's orbital speed `v_p` is given by `v_p = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`. Since `M_p << M_star`, this simplifies to `v_p ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`.\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    Solving for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a) = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n5.  **Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n    Since `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`, we have `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`. Substituting this in:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_1` back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed to calculate the final ratio, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, and the planets' radii. This is a common feature in physics problems to test the understanding of the underlying principles.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on several justified assumptions:\n    *   Circular orbits (stated in the problem).\n    *   Same albedo for both planets (stated in the problem).\n    *   `sin(i) ≈ 1` (justified because transits are observed).\n    *   Planet mass is much smaller than the star mass (`M_p << M_star`), which is true for Earth-mass planets around a Sun-like star.\n*   **Proportionality:** The key is to recognize that the final ratio depends on the ratios of the input variables, allowing many constants and shared parameters to cancel out.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\n1.  **Identify relevant values:**\n    *   Mass of Planet1 (`M_p1`) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet2 (`M_p2`) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet1 (`Δλ_1`) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet2 (`Δλ_2`) = 0.04 Å\n\n2.  **Calculate the mass ratio:**\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Doppler shift ratio:**\n    `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n4.  **Multiply the ratios to get the final answer:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n5.  **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**\n    `15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nComparing this result to the options provided, `~0.53` is the closest match.\n\n<<<B>>>"
