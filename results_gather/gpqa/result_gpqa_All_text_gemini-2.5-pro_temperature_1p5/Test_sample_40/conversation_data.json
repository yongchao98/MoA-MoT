    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n*   We have two frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S:** The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **Frame S':** The rest frame of the glass.\n*   Frame S' (the glass) is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to Frame S (the lab).\n*   A light beam is traveling through the glass.\n*   The velocity of the glass `v` is in the same direction as the propagation of the light beam.\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is given as `c = 1`.\n\n**2. Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (Frame S')**\n*   The index of refraction, `n`, of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n*   The formula is `n = c / u'`.\n*   This definition applies to the medium's own rest frame (Frame S').\n*   Given that `c = 1`, the formula becomes `n = 1 / u'`.\n*   Therefore, the speed of the light beam as measured within the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**\n*   To find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (Frame S), we must use the relativistic formula for the addition of velocities. The simple Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`) is not correct for speeds approaching the speed of light.\n*   The relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in Frame S (the lab frame). This is the value we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (light beam) in Frame S' (the glass frame).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of Frame S' (the glass) relative to Frame S (the lab).\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values into the Formula**\n*   We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v` (the velocity of the glass)\n    *   `c = 1`\n*   Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n*   The expression simplifies to:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n*   To make this expression look like the options provided, we can clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator by multiplying both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n*   Distribute the `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n*   This simplifies to:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n*   The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n*   This matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Frame of Reference:** It is crucial to correctly identify the two frames of reference and the velocities relative to each. `u'` is the speed in the moving frame (the glass), while `u` is the speed in the stationary frame (the lab).\n*   **Definition of Index of Refraction:** Remember that `n = c/u'` is defined in the rest frame of the medium.\n*   **Relativistic vs. Galilean Addition:** This problem involves light, so relativistic effects are significant. The Galilean addition (`u = u' + v = 1/n + v`) would be an incorrect approximation.\n*   **Signs of Velocities:** Both the light beam (in the glass) and the glass itself are moving in the same direction towards the observer. Therefore, `u'` and `v` are both positive in the standard formula.\n*   **`c = 1`:** The simplification `c=1` is a common convention in relativity problems to make the algebra cleaner. Don't forget to use `c^2 = 1^2 = 1` in the denominator of the velocity addition formula.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis: The derived formula `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` is the correct speed of light in the moving glass as seen by the lab observer. This corresponds to the historical Fizeau experiment, which confirmed this velocity addition law.\n\n<<<D>>>"
