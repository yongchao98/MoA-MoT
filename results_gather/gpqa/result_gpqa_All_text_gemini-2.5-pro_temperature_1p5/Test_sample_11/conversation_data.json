    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves the decay of a particle at rest into two other particles. The solution relies on two fundamental conservation laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the decay must equal the total energy of the system after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system before the decay must equal the total momentum of the system after the decay.\n\nSince the particles involved can move at speeds approaching the speed of light, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy `KE` and its rest mass energy `m*c^2`. So, `E = KE + m*c^2`.\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The energy and momentum of a particle are related by the equation `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `p` is momentum and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary. This means its initial kinetic energy is zero, and its initial momentum is zero. Its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n*   **Neutrino Mass:** In this context, the neutrino (`nu`) is considered to be massless (`m_nu = 0`). This is a standard and very accurate approximation for such problems.\n*   **Consequences of a Massless Particle:** For a massless particle like the neutrino:\n    *   Its rest mass energy is zero (`m_nu*c^2 = 0`).\n    *   Its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`E_nu = KE_nu`).\n    *   Its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = p_nu * c`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet the rest masses be `m_pi` and `m_mu`, and the momenta of the products be `p_mu` and `p_nu`. The kinetic energies are `KE_mu` and `KE_nu`.\n\n*   **Step 1: Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n    *   Initial momentum `p_initial = 0` (since Pi+ is at rest).\n    *   Final momentum `p_final = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum).\n    *   By conservation, `p_initial = p_final`, so `0 = p_mu + p_nu`.\n    *   This implies the muon and neutrino fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n    *   `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    *   Initial energy `E_initial` is the rest energy of the pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   Final energy `E_final` is the sum of the total energies of the muon and neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   Using the energy-momentum relation for each particle:\n        *   `E_mu = sqrt((p_mu*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n        *   `E_nu = p_nu*c = p*c` (since the neutrino is massless)\n    *   Equating initial and final energies:\n        `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the Momentum `p`**\n    *   Rearrange the energy equation to isolate the square root term:\n        `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)`\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n        `(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    *   The `(p*c)^2` term cancels on both sides. Now, solve for `p*c`:\n        `2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n        `p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]`\n\n*   **Step 4: Substitute Numerical Values**\n    *   `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   `p*c = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `p*c = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `p*c = [ 8315.67 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `p*c = 29.78 MeV`\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n    *   **For the neutrino (nu):**\n        Since it's massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, `E_nu`.\n        `KE_nu = E_nu = p_nu*c = p*c`\n        `KE_nu = 29.78 MeV â‰ˆ 29.8 MeV`\n\n    *   **For the muon (mu+):**\n        Its kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2`.\n        We can find `E_mu` from the conservation of energy: `E_mu = E_initial - E_nu`.\n        `E_mu = (m_pi*c^2) - (p*c)`\n        `E_mu = 139.6 MeV - 29.78 MeV = 109.82 MeV`\n        Now find the kinetic energy:\n        `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2 = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV`\n        `KE_mu = 4.12 MeV`\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (`mu+`) is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino (`nu`) is 29.8 MeV. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
