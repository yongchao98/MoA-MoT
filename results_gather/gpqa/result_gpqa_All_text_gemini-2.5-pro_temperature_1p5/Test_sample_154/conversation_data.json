    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$. The system is in a specific quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Formula for Uncertainty**\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nFor our problem, this becomes:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nThis means we need to calculate two quantities:\n1.  The expectation value of $P_z$, denoted by $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\n2.  The expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted by $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: List the Given Information**\nWe are given the matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ and the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n*   The operator $P_z$:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The state vector of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. This is consistent with the fact that the matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\nThe expectation value of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is calculated as $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we need the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real, the conjugate transpose is simply the transpose.\n$\\langle\\psi| = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, let's compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet's first multiply the matrix $P_z$ with the ket $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply the bra $\\langle\\psi|$ with the resulting vector:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2) \\times (-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\times (0) + (-1/2) \\times (\\hbar/2)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar/4 + 0 - \\hbar/4 = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\nTo find $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$, we first need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. We get this by squaring the matrix for $P_z$.\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-\\hbar)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, let's compute $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\times (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2) \\times (-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2}) \\times (0) + (-1/2) \\times (-\\hbar^2/2)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4 = 2\\hbar^2/4 = \\hbar^2/2$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\hbar^2/2$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\nNow we plug the values we found into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer Selection**\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $\\hbar$\nB) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\nC) $\\hbar/2$\nD) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
