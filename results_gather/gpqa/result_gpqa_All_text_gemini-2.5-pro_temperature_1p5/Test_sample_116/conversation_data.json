    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it shows optical isomerism.\n\n**What is optical isomerism?**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial chirality:** Restricted rotation about a single bond, leading to a non-superimposable mirror image (atropisomerism), often seen in substituted biphenyls.\nA key test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound where two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond. The ortho positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The bulky groups at the ortho positions (6, 6', 2, 2') cause significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Now, we must check for elements of symmetry. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. If you try to pass a plane through the molecule, the arrangement of substituents will not be a mirror image of each other.\n    *   The molecule also lacks a center of inversion.\n    *   Since rotation is hindered and the molecule is asymmetric, it is chiral. This specific type of chirality is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atoms for any chiral centers. We focus on Carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   Carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and thus optically active (unless it is part of a meso compound, which is not the case here).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical structure is C₆H₅-C(=O)-C₆H₅. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp² hybridized (bonded to only three atoms), and all carbons in the phenyl rings are also sp² hybridized.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active because it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two methoxycarbonyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers. The carbons in the C=C double bond are sp² hybridized.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses several elements of symmetry. Most notably, it has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Inverting any atom through this point will land it on an identical atom.\n    *   A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: **Yes**, shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: **Yes**, shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: **No**, it is achiral.\n*   Compound 4: **No**, it is achiral.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the one that includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
