    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the maximum possible orbital period ($P_2$) for a second planet (Planet 2) in the system, given that it must be able to transit its star. An occultation (the planet passing behind the star) is guaranteed for a circular orbit if a transit occurs.\n\n**2. Identify Key Physical Principles and Definitions**\n*   **Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star. For a transit of the planet's center to occur, its trajectory must cross the star's disk.\n*   **Impact Parameter (b):** This is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius ($R_*$). The condition for the center of the planet to transit the star is $b \\le 1$.\n*   **Maximum Period Condition:** The orbital period is related to the orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$) by Kepler's Third Law. A longer period means a larger orbit. The maximum period for a transiting planet will occur at the largest possible orbital distance that still allows for a transit. This corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter, which is $b=1$ (a grazing transit of the planet's center).\n*   **Relationship between Orbital Parameters:** The definition of the impact parameter is $b = \\frac{a \\cos(i)}{R_*}$, where $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination ($i$). They also orbit the same star ($R_*$ is constant). Therefore, the impact parameter ($b$) is directly proportional to the semi-major axis ($a$).\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of the squares of their periods is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their semi-major axes: $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^3$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Relate Impact Parameter to Semi-Major Axis**\n    For Planet 1: $b_1 = \\frac{a_1 \\cos(i)}{R_*}$\n    For Planet 2: $b_2 = \\frac{a_2 \\cos(i)}{R_*}$\n    Dividing the second equation by the first, we see that the common terms ($R_*$ and $\\cos(i)$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n    This shows a direct proportionality between the impact parameter and the semi-major axis for planets in the same system and plane.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine with Kepler's Third Law**\n    We can substitute the relationship from Step 1 into Kepler's Third Law:\n    $\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{b_2}{b_1}\\right)^3$\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the unknown period, $P_2$**\n    By taking the square root of both sides and rearranging, we get a formula for $P_2$:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{b_2}{b_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n    $P_2 = P_1 \\left(\\frac{b_2}{b_1}\\right)^{3/2}$\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the values to use**\n    *   We are given the period and impact parameter for Planet 1: $P_1 = 3$ days and $b_1 = 0.2$.\n    *   We need to find the *maximum* period for Planet 2. This occurs at the maximum impact parameter that allows a transit. As established, this limiting case is $b_2 = 1$.\n    *   Note: The radii of the star and the planets ($R_*$, $R_{p1}$, $R_{p2}$) are extra information and not needed for the core calculation, which relies on the condition that the *center* of the planet transits.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the final answer**\n    Substitute the known values into the formula from Step 3:\n    $P_2 = 3 \\text{ days} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{0.2}\\right)^{3/2}$\n    $P_2 = 3 \\times (5)^{3/2}$\n    To calculate $5^{3/2}$, we can write it as $\\sqrt{5^3} = \\sqrt{125}$.\n    We know that $\\sqrt{125} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 5} = 5\\sqrt{5}$.\n    Using the approximation $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$:\n    $P_2 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 2.236$\n    $P_2 = 15 \\times 2.236$\n    $P_2 \\approx 33.54$ days.\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<D>>>"
