    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given reactions to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the addition of a hydrogen atom and a cyanide group (CN) across the carbonyl (C=O) double bond of a ketone (butan-2-one). The product is a cyanohydrin. This is a classic nucleophilic addition reaction known as cyanohydrin formation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Nucleophilic Attack.** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN is a nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive (electrophilic) carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2: Protonation.** The alkoxide intermediate is a base. It needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product. Reagent 'A' must be the source of this proton (H⁺).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   `H3O⁺`: This represents an aqueous acidic solution (acidic workup). It is an excellent source of protons and is commonly used in a second step to protonate the alkoxide intermediate formed in the first step.\n    *   `NaHSO3`: Sodium bisulfite is a reagent that can also add to carbonyls, but it is not the reagent used to provide a proton in this context. Its primary use is different (forming bisulfite adducts).\n    *   Therefore, **A = H3O⁺** is the most appropriate reagent for the protonation step.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction transforms a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction of a nitrile. The other parts of the molecule (the hydroxyl group and the aromatic ring) remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and water, a nitrile is hydrolyzed first to an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The overall reaction is R-CN + 2H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** In the presence of a strong base (like NaOH) and water, a nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻) and ammonia (NH₃). To obtain the final carboxylic acid (R-COOH), a separate acidification step is required at the end.\n    *   The question shows a direct conversion to the carboxylic acid using reagent 'B' and water. This is characteristic of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to catalyze this reaction effectively under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent to catalyze the hydrolysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, reagent **A must be H3O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, reagent **B must be HCl**.\n\nCombining these two findings, we look for the option where A = H3O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
