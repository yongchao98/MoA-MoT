    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\nLet's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -CHO group is numbered as C1.\n*   **Substituent:** At position 1, there is a `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` group.\n    *   This substituent is based on a `methyl` group (-CH2-).\n    *   This methyl group is attached to the parent ring at C1.\n    *   On this methyl group, one hydrogen is replaced by a `hydroxy` group (-OH).\n    *   The other hydrogen is replaced by a `cyclohexyl` group.\n    *   So, the substituent is `-CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)`.\n*   **Assembling the structure:** A cyclohexane ring has two groups attached to the same carbon atom (C1): a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl) group.\n\nLet's represent the cyclohexane ring as `Cy`. The structure is `Cy-(C1, bearing a CHO group)-CH(OH)-Cy`.\n\nThis structure is an **aldol addition product**. It is formed from the reaction of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO)**.\n*   One molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde acts as the nucleophile (after being converted to an enolate by a base). The α-proton (on C1 of the ring) is removed.\n*   The other molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde acts as the electrophile (the enolate attacks its carbonyl carbon).\n\nSo, the last step of the synthesis is the base-catalyzed self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n`2 Cy-CHO --[Base]--> Cy-(C1, bearing a CHO group)-CH(OH)-Cy`\nA suitable base for this reaction is Ba(OH)2.\n\n**2. Synthesize the Aldehyde Intermediate**\n\nThe main challenge is to synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) from the starting material, **ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH)**.\n\nWe need to transform `Cy-C≡CH` into `Cy-CHO`. Notice that the carbon atom attached to the cyclohexane ring becomes the aldehyde carbon. This implies a cleavage reaction. A common way to cleave a carbon-carbon multiple bond to form a carbonyl group is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves a C=C double bond.\n\nSo, a plausible strategy is:\nEthynylcyclohexane (alkyne) → Alkene → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (aldehyde)\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step:\n\n**A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride (CH3Cl)**\n    *   `Cy-C≡CH + NaNH2 → Cy-C≡C⁻Na⁺` (Deprotonation of the terminal alkyne)\n    *   `Cy-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH3Cl → Cy-C≡C-CH3` (Alkylation to form an internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne)\n    *   This step is correct and produces a suitable intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst)**\n    *   `Cy-C≡C-CH3 + H2/Lindlar cat. → cis-Cy-CH=CH-CH3` ((Z)-1-cyclohexyl-1-propene)\n    *   This is a syn-hydrogenation that converts the alkyne to a cis-alkene. The reaction stops at the alkene stage, which is necessary for ozonolysis. This step is correct.\n\n*   **Step 3: O3 / (CH3)2S**\n    *   `cis-Cy-CH=CH-CH3 --[1. O3; 2. (CH3)2S]--> Cy-CHO + CH3-CHO`\n    *   This is ozonolysis with a reductive workup ((CH3)2S). It cleaves the double bond and produces two aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (our desired intermediate) and acetaldehyde. This step is correct.\n\n*   **Step 4: Ba(OH)2**\n    *   `2 Cy-CHO --[Ba(OH)2]--> 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`\n    *   This is the base-catalyzed aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product. This step is correct.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This entire sequence is chemically sound and produces the target molecule.\n\n---\n\n**B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNH2, methanol (CH3OH)**\n    *   The acetylide anion (`Cy-C≡C⁻`) formed by NaNH2 is a very strong base. Methanol is a much stronger acid (pKa ≈ 15.5) than the terminal alkyne (pKa ≈ 25). The acetylide will immediately deprotonate methanol, regenerating the starting alkyne: `Cy-C≡C⁻ + CH3OH → Cy-C≡CH + CH3O⁻`. This step does not lead to a useful product.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This option is incorrect due to the first step.\n\n---\n\n**C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n\n*   **Step 2: H2/Pd**\n    *   After forming `Cy-C≡C-CH3` in step 1, reacting it with H2 and a standard Palladium catalyst (not poisoned) will cause complete reduction of the alkyne to an alkane: `Cy-C≡C-CH3 + 2H2/Pd → Cy-CH2-CH2-CH3` (propylcyclohexane).\n    *   An alkane is unreactive towards the subsequent reagents. Also, the ordering of reagents is illogical (adding a base to an alkane, then hydration reagents).\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This option is incorrect because the alkyne is over-reduced.\n\n---\n\n**D) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride (C2H5Cl)**\n    *   `Cy-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + C2H5Cl → Cy-C≡C-CH2CH3` (1-cyclohexyl-1-butyne)\n\n*   **Step 3: O3/H2O**\n    *   After forming the alkene `Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH3` in step 2, ozonolysis is performed. However, the workup is with H2O, which is an **oxidative workup**. An oxidative workup converts aldehydes formed during ozonolysis into carboxylic acids.\n    *   `Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH3 --[1. O3; 2. H2O]--> Cy-COOH + CH3CH2-COOH` (Cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and propanoic acid).\n    *   Since cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is not formed, the final aldol reaction cannot occur.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This option is incorrect due to the oxidative workup in the ozonolysis step.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only the sequence of reagents in option A correctly transforms ethynylcyclohexane into 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Each step is a standard and appropriate transformation that leads logically to the next intermediate and finally to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
