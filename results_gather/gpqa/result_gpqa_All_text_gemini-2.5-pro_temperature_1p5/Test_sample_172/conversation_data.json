    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Fundamental Principle**: The problem deals with uncertainties in position and energy, which is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle has two common forms:\n    *   Position-Momentum Uncertainty:  $Δx \\cdot Δp \\ge \\frac{ħ}{2}$\n    *   Energy-Time Uncertainty: $ΔE \\cdot Δt \\ge \\frac{ħ}{2}$\n    where $ħ$ is the reduced Planck constant ($ħ = \\frac{h}{2π} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$).\n\n2.  **Relate the Given Information to the Desired Quantity**:\n    *   We are given the uncertainty in position, $Δx$.\n    *   We need to find the uncertainty in energy, $ΔE$.\n    *   The standard forms of the uncertainty principle do not directly connect $Δx$ and $ΔE$. We need to find an intermediate relationship. We can connect them through momentum ($p$).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($Δp$)**:\n    *   Using the position-momentum uncertainty principle, we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($Δp_x$) corresponding to the given uncertainty in position ($Δx$).\n    *   $Δx \\cdot Δp_x \\ge \\frac{ħ}{2}$\n    *   For an estimation of the minimum uncertainty, we can use the approximation: $Δp_x \\approx \\frac{ħ}{Δx}$ or $Δp_x \\approx \\frac{ħ}{2Δx}$. Since the options are different by orders of magnitude, using $Δp_x \\approx \\frac{ħ}{Δx}$ is sufficient for a good estimate.\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is crucial to use the correct units. The uncertainty in position is given as $Δx = 0.1 \\text{ nm}$, which must be converted to meters: $Δx = 0.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Calculation of $Δp_x$:\n        $Δp_x \\approx \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{10^{-10} \\text{ m}} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}$\n\n4.  **Relate Uncertainty in Momentum ($Δp_x$) to Uncertainty in Energy ($ΔE$)**:\n    *   The relationship between energy and momentum for a particle is given by the energy-momentum relation. For small uncertainties, we can use a differential relationship: $ΔE \\approx \\left| \\frac{dE}{dp_x} \\right| Δp_x$.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The electron's speed is $v = 2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$). This means we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$.\n    *   Let's find the derivative $\\frac{dE}{dp}$:\n        Differentiating the relation with respect to $p$:\n        $2E \\frac{dE}{dp} = 2pc^2$\n        $\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{pc^2}{E}$\n    *   From relativistic dynamics, we know $E = γm_0c^2$ and $p = γm_0v$. Substituting these gives:\n        $\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{(γm_0v)c^2}{γm_0c^2} = v$\n    *   This shows that the relationship $\\frac{dE}{dp} = v$ is valid even in the relativistic case.\n    *   Therefore, the uncertainty relationship is: $ΔE \\approx v \\cdot Δp_x$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy ($ΔE$)**:\n    *   Now we combine the results from the previous steps.\n    *   $ΔE \\approx v \\cdot Δp_x$\n    *   Using the values we have:\n        *   $v = 2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n        *   $Δp_x \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}$\n    *   $ΔE \\approx (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (1.054 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s})$\n    *   $ΔE \\approx 2.108 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}$\n\n6.  **Final Answer Selection**:\n    *   The calculated value is $ΔE \\approx 2.108 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}$.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n        B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n        C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n        D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n    *   Our result is clearly on the order of magnitude of $10^{-16} \\text{ J}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
