    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of acetic acid is diluted with an equal volume of water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration.\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   Final Molarity (M₂) = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution being titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate pKa:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    *   [A⁻] = 25%\n    *   [HA] = 100% - 25% = 75%\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253 ≈ **4.26**\n\n**Careful point:** At any point before the equivalence point in the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, the solution is a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is the appropriate tool. The ratio of moles can be used directly in the equation instead of concentrations, as they are in the same volume.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base of the weak acid. This conjugate base will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Find moles of acid:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.00100 mol\n*   **Find the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.00100 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0100 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Find the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Find the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n*   **Set up the hydrolysis reaction and calculate [OH⁻]:**\n    *   The reaction is: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb: Kb = Kw / Ka\n    *   Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Use the formula for the [OH⁻] of a weak base: [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻])\n    *   [OH⁻] = √( (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 ) = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\n**Careful point:** The pH at the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration is always greater than 7 because the product is a weak base. The final concentration of this weak base must be calculated using the total volume of the solution at that point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
