    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Observations**\n\n*   **Compound:** A small, chemically synthesized peptide. Peptides are polymers of amino acids, which are chiral molecules (except for glycine). They are linked by amide bonds.\n*   **Observation 1: 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   An alpha-proton (the proton on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group of an amino acid) shows up as two distinct peaks.\n    *   The peaks have similar chemical shifts.\n    *   Their integrals are roughly equal, and their sum corresponds to one proton (1H). This indicates a ~1:1 mixture of two species where this alpha-proton is in a slightly different chemical environment in each species.\n    *   The peak duplication is not due to spin-spin coupling. This means we are not seeing a simple doublet, but rather two separate signals (e.g., two singlets, or two doublets, etc.) for the same type of proton.\n*   **Observation 2: LC-MS Analysis**\n    *   LC (Liquid Chromatography) shows two distinct peaks, meaning the two species are physically separable.\n    *   The peak intensities are equal, confirming the ~1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n    *   MS (Mass Spectrometry) shows that both peaks have the same mass.\n    *   The mass for both peaks is consistent with the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n    *   The analysis is done at an \"elevated temperature,\" which can sometimes improve the separation of species that are interconverting (known as conformers or rotamers).\n\n**2. Analyze the Possible Explanations (the options)**\n\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.**\n    *   A precursor in a peptide synthesis would be a smaller peptide or an unreacted amino acid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A precursor would have a *different* (usually lower) molecular weight than the final product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is inconsistent with the MS data, which shows both species have the same, correct mass.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image molecules (like a left hand and a right hand).\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (NMR):** Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. A standard 1H NMR experiment uses an achiral solvent and is an achiral environment. Therefore, enantiomers give identical NMR spectra and cannot be distinguished. You would only see one set of peaks. This contradicts the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (LC):** To separate enantiomers, you need a chiral stationary phase (chiral LC). While possible, standard LC (like reverse-phase) does not separate them. Even if chiral LC were used, this explanation still fails to account for the NMR data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them. (e.g., R,S vs R,R).\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Properties):** Unlike enantiomers, diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (NMR):** Because their 3D structures are different, their constituent protons exist in different chemical environments. Therefore, diastereoisomers will have different NMR spectra. A 1:1 mixture would show two complete sets of peaks, with corresponding protons in each isomer appearing at different chemical shifts. This perfectly explains the two observed peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (LC):** Because they have different physical properties (like polarity), diastereoisomers can be separated by standard, achiral chromatography techniques like HPLC. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace.\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (MS):** By definition, isomers have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. This is consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **How this could happen in a peptide:** This could happen if one of the chiral amino acid starting materials was not pure (e.g., a racemic D/L mixture was used instead of a pure L-amino acid), or if epimerization (the flipping of a chiral center) occurred at one of the alpha-carbons during the harsh chemical synthesis steps. Another very common source in peptides is the cis-trans isomerism around a peptide bond (especially involving proline), as the cis and trans conformers are diastereomeric to each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is fully consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.**\n    *   This term implies a side reaction where an extra molecule has been added, for instance, a dipeptide forming on a reactive side chain.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Such a reaction would change the chemical formula and therefore the molecular weight of the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is inconsistent with the MS data, which shows the correct mass for the expected molecule.\n\n**3. Final Synthesis**\n\nThe experimental evidence points strongly to the presence of two molecular species that are isomers of each other (same mass) but have different physical properties (separable by LC) and different spectroscopic properties (distinguishable by NMR). This is the definition of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
