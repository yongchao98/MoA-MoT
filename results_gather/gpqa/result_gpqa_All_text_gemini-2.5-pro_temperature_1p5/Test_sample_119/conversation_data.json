    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Assumption**\nThe question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax itself (`plx`). The fundamental assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly in three-dimensional space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant everywhere.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Parallax to Distance**\nParallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The exact relationship is `d = 1/plx` (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). For our analysis, the proportionality is what matters:\n`d ∝ 1/plx`\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell of Space**\nTo find the number of stars *at* a certain parallax, we must consider stars at the corresponding distance. We can do this by imagining a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer.\n*   Let the shell have a radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`.\n*   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = (4πd²) * dd`.\n*   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the shell's volume:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd²) * dd`\n\n**Step 4: Change Variables from Distance (`d`) to Parallax (`plx`)**\nOur expression for `dN` is in terms of `d` and `dd`, but the question asks about parallax. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n\n1.  **Substitute `d`**: From Step 2, we know `d = 1/plx`. We substitute this into the `d²` term:\n    `d² = (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`\n\n2.  **Substitute `dd`**: We need to find how the thickness of the shell `dd` relates to a small interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars within a physical range, we consider the magnitude of the relationship: `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Expression**\nNow we substitute the expressions for `d²` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN` from Step 3.\n\n`dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) d(plx) )`\n\nCombining the terms:\n\n`dN = (4πρ / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This equation gives the number of stars (`dN`) found within a small parallax interval (`d(plx)`).\n\n**Step 6: Find the Number of Stars Per Unit Parallax**\nThe question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our final equation by `d(plx)`:\n\n`dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4`\n\nSince `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Uniform Density:** The entire derivation rests on the assumption that `ρ` is constant.\n2.  **Differential Count:** We are looking for a density (`dN/d(plx)`), not a cumulative count (`N`), which requires considering a thin shell (`dV`) rather than a full sphere (`V`). A common mistake is to start with `N ∝ d³ ∝ 1/plx³` and incorrectly conclude the answer is `1/plx³`.\n3.  **Jacobian of Transformation:** When changing variables from distance to parallax, both `d` and the differential element `dd` must be transformed. The transformation of `dd` to `d(plx)` introduces an additional factor of `1/plx²`, which is crucial for the final result.\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
