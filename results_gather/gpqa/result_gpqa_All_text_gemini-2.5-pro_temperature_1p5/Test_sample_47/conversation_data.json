    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product's structure.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine (Br₂), forming product 1.**\n    *   This reaction is the acid-catalyzed (often by trace HBr) α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone has two equivalent α-carbons. The reaction involves the formation of an enol intermediate, which then attacks the bromine molecule.\n    *   The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) was heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon, when treated with a strong base like NaOH, undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α-carbon not bearing the bromine (C6). This forms an enolate.\n    *   The enolate anion then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate (a cyclopropanone fused to a cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the three-membered ring. This results in a ring contraction.\n    *   The final product, after protonation (which would happen during a workup, or the next reagent SOCl₂ can react with the carboxylate salt), is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the reagent, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃), forming product 4.**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine the number of sets of chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms in this molecule.\n\nLet's label the carbons of the ring starting from the carbon attached to the aldehyde group as C1.\n\n```\n       H(a)\n       |\n    O==C\n       |\n    H(b)-C1\n      /  \\\n  H(c,d)-C2--C5-H(c,d)\n        |    |\n  H(e,f)-C3--C4-H(e,f)\n         \\  /\n```\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** Cyclopentane rings are not planar but undergo rapid puckering at room temperature. For NMR purposes, we consider the time-averaged structure, which possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon, the C1-H bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n2.  **Proton Environments:**\n    *   **H(a):** The aldehyde proton. It is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1 distinct type** of hydrogen.\n    *   **H(b):** The proton on C1 (a methine group, CH). It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is **1 distinct type** of hydrogen.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 chemically equivalent. Each of these carbons is a methylene group (CH₂). The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic because C2 is adjacent to the prostereogenic center C1 (substituting one H would create a diastereomer relative to substituting the other H, because a second chiral center would be created at C1). Therefore, the two protons on C2 are chemically distinct from each other. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives **2 distinct types** of hydrogens for the C2/C5 positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 chemically equivalent. Each is a methylene group (CH₂). The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This can be confirmed with a substitution test: replacing one proton on C3 with a different group (e.g., Deuterium) creates two new chiral centers (at C1 and C3), and the resulting molecule is a diastereomer of the one formed by replacing the other proton on C3. Thus, the two protons on C3 are chemically distinct. By symmetry, these two distinct proton types are mirrored on C4. This gives another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens for the C3/C4 positions.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n    *   C1-H: 1 type\n    *   C2/C5 protons: 2 types\n    *   C3/C4 protons: 2 types\n    *   Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nFinal Answer is 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
