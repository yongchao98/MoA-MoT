    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and results.**\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The gaseous products are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ (which would form a CaCO₃ precipitate) or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts like carbonates, sulfites, or most sulfates.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot Copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states that CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This weight increase is due to the oxygen atoms that bonded with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The oxidizing gas must have supplied these 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Common oxidizing gases in such decompositions are O₂ or N₂O.\n        *   If the gas was O₂, we would have 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol of O₂.\n        *   If the gas was N₂O, we would have 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas C did not react with a drying agent, limewater, or hot copper, indicating it's an inert gas like N₂.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the composition of the gaseous products.**\nLet's consider the two possibilities for the oxidizing gas.\n\n*   **Possibility A:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O. The reaction in tube №3 is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n    *   This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n    *   The total remaining gas C (0.10 mol) would be the sum of any inert gas produced directly from the salt decomposition and the 0.05 mol of N₂ produced in tube №3. This means the initial salt decomposition must have produced 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of an inert gas (likely N₂).\n    *   So, the initial gaseous products were: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** The oxidizing gas is O₂. The reaction in tube №3 is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.025 mol of O₂ must have reacted.\n    *   The remaining gas C (0.10 mol) would be the inert gas from the initial decomposition.\n    *   So, the initial gaseous products were: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\nPossibility A is more likely given the common decomposition products of nitrogen-containing salts. Let's proceed with this assumption and verify it.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) strongly suggest that the original salts contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Common salts that fit this profile are ammonium salts of oxyanions of nitrogen.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes upon heating: NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes upon heating: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n\nLet's test if an equimolar mixture of these two salts (A and B) matches our findings. Let the mixture contain `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₂: `n` mol of N₂ and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` mol of NH₄NO₃: `n` mol of N₂O and `2n` mol of H₂O are produced.\n\n**Total products from the mixture:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` mol\n*   Total N₂O = `n` mol\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = `4n` mol\n\nNow, let's match this with our derived amounts from Step 2 (Possibility A):\n*   Total H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol  =>  `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂O: `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   Total N₂: `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield a consistent value of `n = 0.05` mol. This confirms our hypothesis. The initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass.**\nLet's check if the mass of this mixture is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 2*14 + 4*1 + 2*16 = 28 + 4 + 32 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 2*14 + 4*1 + 3*16 = 28 + 4 + 48 = 80 g/mol.\n\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64 g/mol = 3.20 g.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total mass of mixture = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem. The identification of salts A and B as ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe final question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in salts A and B** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
