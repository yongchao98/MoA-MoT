    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane and excess KOH.\n    *   **Conditions:** Heated to 240°C.\n    *   **Product 1 Data:** IR spectrum shows a C=O group at 1720 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of a ketone, likely in a strained ring). The ¹H NMR shows a total of 14 protons, same as the starting material, implying no elimination of HBr has occurred in the net reaction. The reaction is a rearrangement and substitution.\n    *   **Reaction Identity:** This is a known, albeit complex, reaction. 1,3-dihaloadamantanes, under strong basic conditions at high temperature, undergo a skeletal rearrangement. The adamantane cage rearranges to the less stable, but kinetically accessible, protoadamantane skeleton. The product is **protoadamantan-4-one** (also named tricyclo[4.3.1.0³⁸]decan-4-one). The strange NMR data provided in the question (especially the 4.79 ppm signal) is likely erroneous, as it does not match the known spectrum of this compound. However, the IR data and the chemical context strongly point to this structure.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) and an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n    *   **Conditions:** Heated.\n    *   **Reaction Identity:** The crucial information is in the next step: Product 2 reacts with ozone. Ozonolysis specifically cleaves C=C double bonds. Therefore, **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**.\n    *   How is a C=C bond formed from a ketone (Product 1) using Al(O-iPr)₃? While this reagent is famous for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction (C=O → C-OH), it can also act as a base (isopropoxide is basic). At high temperatures, ketones with α-protons can undergo base-catalyzed self-condensation (an aldol condensation).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  The isopropoxide removes an α-proton from one molecule of protoadamantan-4-one to form an enolate.\n        b.  This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of protoadamantan-4-one.\n        c.  The resulting aldol adduct dehydrates (loses H₂O) upon heating to form a C=C bond. The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone dimer.\n    *   **Product 2:** The self-condensation product of protoadamantan-4-one. It is a large molecule (C₂₀H₂₆O) containing a C=C bond that connects two protoadamantane units.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2, ozone (O₃), and then dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Reaction Identity:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The C=C double bond in Product 2 is cleaved, and each carbon atom of the original double bond becomes a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Since Product 2 was formed by the self-condensation of two molecules of Product 1, ozonolysis breaks it apart.\n        a.  One fragment regenerates the original ketone, **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n        b.  The other fragment is also derived from protoadamantan-4-one, but its α-carbon (which was part of the C=C bond) is converted into a carbonyl group. This results in a dione.\n    *   **Product 3:** The question asks for the analysis of \"product 3\", implying a single structure of interest. This would be the new dione formed. The structure is **protoadamantane-2,4-dione**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    *   **Structure:** Product 3 is protoadamantane-2,4-dione. This is a β-diketone within a rigid cage structure.\n    *   **Target Proton:** We need to find the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding any that are acidic and would exchange with D₂O (like enolic protons or some α-protons). The protons on the CH₂ group at C-5 are α to a carbonyl and potentially exchangeable. The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton will be the one at the C-3 bridgehead (H-3). This proton is situated between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, leading to significant deshielding. Formation of an enol or enolate at a bridgehead position is forbidden by Bredt's rule, so this proton is not acidic/exchangeable.\n    *   **Coupling Analysis of H-3:** We must determine what other protons H-3 will couple with. Coupling is typically observed through 2 bonds (geminal), 3 bonds (vicinal), and sometimes 4 bonds (long-range, e.g., 'W'-coupling in rigid systems).\n        a.  H-3 is on a carbon with no other protons (no geminal coupling).\n        b.  **Vicinal (3-bond) coupling:** H-3 will couple to the protons on adjacent carbons. C-3 is bonded to bridgehead C-1 (bearing H-1) and bridgehead C-8 (bearing H-8). So, H-3 couples to H-1 and H-8. These two protons are in different chemical environments, so we expect two different coupling constants, J(H3-H1) and J(H3-H8).\n        c.  **Long-range (4-bond) coupling:** In rigid cages like protoadamantane, 'W'-coupling is common and significant. H-3 has a \"W\" geometric relationship with one proton on C-9 and one proton on C-10. These two protons are in similar, though not identical, environments. It is a very common and reasonable approximation in such systems that their coupling constants to H-3 will be nearly identical: J(H3-H9) ≈ J(H3-H10).\n    *   **Putting it all together (the multiplicity):**\n        *   We need to determine the final pattern based on these couplings. Let's make some reasonable physical assumptions.\n        *   The two 'W' couplings to H-9 and H-10 are likely very similar. Coupling to these two \"equivalent\" protons will split the H-3 signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   The vicinal coupling to H-1, J(H3-H1), will be significant. This will split the triplet into a triplet of doublets.\n        *   What about the vicinal coupling to H-8, J(H3-H8)? The Karplus relationship states that vicinal coupling depends on the dihedral angle. It is very common in strained polycyclic systems for certain dihedral angles to be close to 90°, which makes the corresponding coupling constant close to zero. It is a plausible scenario that J(H3-H8) ≈ 0 Hz.\n        *   **Final Pattern:** If H-3 couples significantly to H-1 (one proton) and to the H-9/H-10 pair (two equivalent protons), and its coupling to H-8 is negligible, the resulting pattern will be a **doublet** (from H-1) of **triplets** (from the H-9/H-10 pair).\n\nFinal Answer is therefore \"doublet of triplets\".\n\n<<<A>>>"
