    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Initial State\n*   **The Particle and its Moment:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. The relationship between its magnetic moment vector `μ` and its spin vector `S` is given by `μ = γS`. This means the components are related as `μ_x = γS_x`, `μ_y = γS_y`, and `μ_z = γS_z`.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The particle is initially in a uniform magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction). The interaction Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ . B_vec = -γS . (B * z_hat) = -γB S_z`.\n*   **\"Aligned\" with the Field:** The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This implies the system is in its lowest possible energy state. The energy levels of `H_initial` are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of S_z)`. The eigenvalues of `S_z` for a spin-1/2 particle are `+ħ/2` (for the spin-up state `|+>_z`) and `-ħ/2` (for the spin-down state `|->_z`).\n    *   Energy of `|+>_z`: `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Energy of `|->_z`: `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   Assuming `γ` (the gyromagnetic ratio) is positive, the lower energy state is `E_+`. This corresponds to the spin-up state `|+>_z`. In this state, the expectation value of the spin `S_z` is `+ħ/2`, and the expectation value of the magnetic moment `μ_z` is `+γħ/2`, which points in the same direction as the magnetic field `B_vec`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the New Hamiltonian and the Dynamics\n*   **Sudden Change:** At `t=0`, the Z-direction field is turned off, and a new field of the same magnitude `B` is turned on in the +Y direction. So, for `t>0`, the magnetic field is `B_vec_new = B * y_hat`.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian that governs the system's evolution for `t>0` is `H_new = -μ . B_vec_new = -γS . (B * y_hat) = -γB S_y`.\n*   **System Dynamics:** The initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+>_z` is an eigenstate of `S_z`, but it is *not* an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (which depends on `S_y`). Because the state is not a stationary state of the new Hamiltonian, it will evolve in time according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This time evolution manifests as a precession of the spin's expectation value `<S>` around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is equivalent to finding the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>(t)`.\n\nWe can use the general equation for the time evolution of the expectation value of the spin vector in a magnetic field (Ehrenfest's theorem), which describes Larmor precession:\n`d<S>/dt = γ <S> x B_vec`\n\nFor our system with `B_vec = B * y_hat`:\n`d<S>/dt = γ (<S_x>x_hat + <S_y>y_hat + <S_z>z_hat) x (B * y_hat)`\n`d<S>/dt = γB [ <S_x>(x_hat x y_hat) + <S_z>(z_hat x y_hat) ]`\n`d<S>/dt = γB [ <S_x>z_hat - <S_z>x_hat ]`\n\nThis gives us a set of coupled differential equations for the components of `<S>`:\n1.  `d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>`\n2.  `d<S_y>/dt = 0`\n3.  `d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>`\n\nWe also need the initial values at `t=0`:\n*   `<S_z>(0) = <+|_z S_z |+>_z = +ħ/2`\n*   `<S_x>(0) = <+|_z S_x |+>_z = 0`\n*   `<S_y>(0) = <+|_z S_y |+>_z = 0`\n\nNow we solve the differential equations. Let's focus on `<S_z>(t)`.\nTake the time derivative of equation (3):\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (d<S_x>/dt)`\n\nSubstitute equation (1) into this:\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>)`\n`d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\nBy comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>(t)` is:\n`ω = γB`\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe expectation value of the z-component of spin, `<S_z>(t)`, oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. The full solution is `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nConsequently, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t)`, also oscillates with the same frequency. This frequency, `ω = γB`, is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe options provided are in units of angular frequency, so the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   **Initial State:** Correctly identifying the initial state as `|+>_z` based on the \"alignment\" with the Z-field (lowest energy state).\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** Correctly identifying the Hamiltonian `H = -γBS_y` that governs the time evolution after the field is switched.\n*   **Dynamics:** Recognizing that the non-eigenstate `|+>_z` will evolve, leading to precession around the new field axis (Y-axis).\n*   **Observable:** Understanding that the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the *expectation value* `<μ_z>(t)`.\n*   **Frequency:** The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength `B` and the gyromagnetic ratio `γ`.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
