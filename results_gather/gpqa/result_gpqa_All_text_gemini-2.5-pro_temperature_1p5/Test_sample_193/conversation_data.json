    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Partition Function**\n\n*   The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\n*   Each spin can take one of two values: +1 or -1.\n*   The total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n*   The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3].\n*   The partition function (Z) is defined as the sum over all possible microstates (i) of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE_i), where β = 1/(kT).\n    Z = Σ_states exp(-βE)\n\n**2. List All Possible Microstates and Calculate Their Energies**\n\nWe need to consider all 8 possible combinations of (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the energy for each one. A careful point here is to systematically list all states to avoid missing any.\n\nLet's calculate the term X = S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 for each state. The energy will then be E = -J*X.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are parallel.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.  Energy E = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Energy E = -3J.\n    *   So, there are **2 states** with an energy of **E = -3J**.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are parallel, one is anti-parallel.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1): X = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1): X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1): X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1): X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. Energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n    *   So, there are **6 states** with an energy of **E = +J**.\n\n**3. Summarize Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies**\n\nWe have found two distinct energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states with that energy):\n\n*   Energy Level E1 = -3J has a degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   Energy Level E2 = +J has a degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\n*Careful Point:* As a check, the sum of the degeneracies should equal the total number of microstates: g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8. This matches our initial count, so our state enumeration is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all energy levels of the degeneracy of that level multiplied by its Boltzmann factor.\nZ = g1 * exp(-β*E1) + g2 * exp(-β*E2)\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (+J))\n\nSimplifying the exponents gives:\nZ = 2 * exp(3βJ) + 6 * exp(-βJ)\n\n*Careful Point:* Pay close attention to the signs. The formula has a negative sign, -βE. When the energy E is negative (like -3J), the exponent becomes positive (-β * -3J = +3βJ). When the energy E is positive (like +J), the exponent remains negative (-β * +J = -βJ).\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nLet's look at the given choices:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated result, Z = 2exp(3βJ) + 6exp(-βJ), matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
