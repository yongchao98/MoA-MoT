    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. We can write this as a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.2857% = 1/7.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n*   Cross-multiply: `7y = 12x + y`\n*   Simplify: `6y = 12x`, which gives `y = 2x`.\n*   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents that fit the CnH2n formula are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Let's check the H percentage for both:\n    *   For C6H12: %H = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This fits.\n    *   For C7H14: %H = 14 / (7*12 + 14) = 14 / 98 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This also fits.\n*   We will proceed by testing the more common and prototypical example, cyclohexane, first. Let's assume **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set **Y1 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also give cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y2 doesn't decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. A plausible candidate is the corresponding aromatic compound, **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture **Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the given conditions for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of Mixture X**\n*   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of both components of X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction that forms an equimolar mixture of Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n*   The reaction can be written as: `1 X1 + 1 X2 → 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H6`.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number on the product side.\n    *   Total C atoms: X1 and X2 must both be C6 compounds. C6 + C6 = C6 + C6. OK.\n    *   Total H atoms: The sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 must equal the sum in the products. Total H = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n*   So, if X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, then **a + b = 18**.\n*   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated precursors to cyclohexane, their hydrogen counts (a and b) must be less than 12. The common unsaturated C6 ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n*   The only pair of these that adds up to 18 is {10, 8}. Therefore, mixture X is composed of a **C6H10** isomer and a **C6H8** isomer.\n*   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of X.\n    *   For C6H10, cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation. This is a valid component.\n    *   For C6H8, we need a cyclohexadiene without conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, but **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** is not. This is a valid component.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), and the cyclohexene (C6H10) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    `C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    This reaction is chemically sound and matches all the problem's descriptions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first component (C6H8) and one molecule of the second component (C6H10).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis confirms our result. The C7 pathway (Z=methylcyclohexane) would lead to X = {C7H12, C7H10}, giving a total H count of 22 (also an option). However, cyclohexane is arguably a more \"widely used\" solvent than methylcyclohexane, and the C6 system is a more classic example of this type of reaction, making it the most probable intended answer.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>"
