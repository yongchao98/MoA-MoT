    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring substituted with a bromine (Br) atom at position 1 and a deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen) atom at position 2. The other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are occupied by standard hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂). This is an extremely strong base. The active species is the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n    *   **Solvent:** Condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base typically proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The strong base NH₂⁻ abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (Br). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n    *   **Position C-2:** This position holds a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   **Position C-6:** This position holds a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The base can abstract either the H from C-6 or the D from C-2. This leads to two different reaction pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        2.  The electrons from the C6-H bond form a new bond between C-6 and C-1, creating a triple bond.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne** (if the triple bond is numbered C1-C6, the deuterium is at C3).\n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n        1.  The NH₂⁻ base removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. (Note: This is slower than H⁺ abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The electrons from the C2-D bond form a new bond between C-2 and C-1, creating a triple bond.\n        3.  The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C-1.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom has been removed from the molecule. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n    So, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) now attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃). We must analyze the addition to each intermediate separately.\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deutero-benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C-1 and C-6, and a deuterium at C-2.\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-6 of the triple bond. These two atoms are not equivalent because of the deuterium at C-2.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-1. A carbanion forms at C-6, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or o-deuteroaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C-6. A carbanion forms at C-1, which is then protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber this molecule so that the -NH₂ group is at C-1, the deuterium is at C-3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline** (or m-deuteroaniline).\n\n    *   **Addition to Intermediate from Pathway B (non-deuterated benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate has a triple bond between C-1 and C-2 and no deuterium.\n        *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C-1 or C-2. Since the benzyne is symmetrical (in the absence of other substituents), both attacks lead to the same product.\n        *   **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The -NH₂ group attaches to one carbon of the former triple bond, and the other carbon is protonated. The final product has no deuterium. This is simply **aniline**.\n\n### Listing All Possible Products and Careful Points\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Elimination Pathways:** The presence of both H and D at the ortho positions is the crucial starting point. It means two different elimination pathways must be considered.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE):** The C-H bond is broken more easily and quickly than the C-D bond. This means Pathway A is faster than Pathway B, and the deuterated products (2- and 3-deuteroaniline) will be the major products. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must include the product from the slower Pathway B.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Asymmetric Benzyne Addition:** The benzyne intermediate from Pathway A is asymmetric due to the deuterium substituent. Attack by the nucleophile at the two ends of the triple bond leads to two different constitutional isomers (isotopomers).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Symmetric Benzyne Addition:** The benzyne intermediate from Pathway B is symmetric, so attack at either end yields only one product.\n\n### Final Tally of Products\n\nFrom the analysis, we have identified three distinct possible organic products:\n1.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated, from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
