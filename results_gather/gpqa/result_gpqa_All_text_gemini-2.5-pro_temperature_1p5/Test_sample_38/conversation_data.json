    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving the normalization of a wave function. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of the constant \"a\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core principle of wave function normalization.**\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function Ψ(x) describes the state of a particle. The probability of finding this particle in a small interval dx is given by |Ψ(x)|² dx, where |Ψ(x)|² is the probability density function. A fundamental requirement is that the total probability of finding the particle *somewhere* in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1 (or 100%). This is called the normalization condition. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integral is taken over all space where the particle can be found.\n\n**Step 2: Define the region of integration.**\nThe problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3. This tells us that the particle is confined to the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the wave function Ψ(x) is zero everywhere else. Our integral for the normalization condition will be from x=1 to x=3.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n∫ (from 1 to 3) |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|².**\nThe wave function is a complex number. The given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i\nA complex number `z` is generally written as `z = Re + i*Im`, where `Re` is the real part and `Im` is the imaginary part. The modulus squared, |z|², is calculated as `|z|² = (Re)² + (Im)²`.\n\nFor our wave function:\n*   Real part: Re(Ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   Imaginary part: Im(Ψ) = -0.5\n\nNow we can calculate the probability density, |Ψ(x)|²:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (Re(Ψ))² + (Im(Ψ))²\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**Step 4: Set up and solve the normalization integral.**\nWe now substitute the expression for |Ψ(x)|² into our normalization equation:\n∫ (from 1 to 3) [ a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1\n\nWe can split this integral into two parts for easier calculation:\n∫ (from 1 to 3) [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫ (from 1 to 3) 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **Part 1: The first integral**\n    ∫ [a² / (1 + x)] dx = a² * ∫ [1 / (1 + x)] dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). We evaluate this from 1 to 3:\n    a² * [ln(1+x)] (from 1 to 3) = a² * [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)]\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Part 2: The second integral**\n    ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * [x] (from 1 to 3)\n    = 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the constant \"a\".**\nNow, substitute the results of the two parts back into the main equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nIsolate the term with `a²`:\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nSolve for `a²`:\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\n\nFinally, take the square root to find `a`:\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is very close to 0.85.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly identify the normalization condition:** The total probability over all possible space must be 1.\n2.  **Use the correct limits of integration:** The problem specifies the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3.\n3.  **Correctly calculate the modulus squared |Ψ|²:** For a complex function `z = R + iI`, |z|² = R² + I². A common mistake is to simply square the function as if it were real.\n4.  **Perform the integration correctly:** The integral of 1/(1+x) is a standard natural logarithm.\n5.  **Pay attention to the algebra:** The final steps of isolating and solving for 'a' must be done carefully.\n6.  **The number of systems (10,000) is context:** It emphasizes that this is a quantum system where properties are described by probabilities, but the number itself does not enter the calculation for the normalization constant `a`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the calculated value of 'a' is approximately 0.8493, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
