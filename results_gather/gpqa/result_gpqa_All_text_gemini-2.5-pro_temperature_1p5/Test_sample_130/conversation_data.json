    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: The anhydride (dienophile).**\n    *   It is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. A chemical shift of 7 ppm is typical for vinylic protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. The singlet nature for two protons suggests a plane of symmetry.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks. The peak at 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. The peak at 137 ppm is in the alkene region. The presence of only two peaks implies a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   The simplest structure fitting this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has two equivalent alkene protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two C=O carbons and two C=C carbons), matching the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: The diene.**\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at positions 1-4, a methyl group on each of these four carbons, and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reaction type and the structure of the products.**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The stereochemistry of the dienophile is conserved. Since maleic anhydride is a *cis* dienophile, the anhydride ring will be fused in a *cis* manner to the newly formed six-membered ring.\n*   The reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The Alder Endo Rule predicts that for kinetic control (the usual condition for Diels-Alder), the **endo adduct is the major product**, and the **exo adduct is the minor product**.\n*   Let's check the molecular formula of the product.\n    *   Diene (C₉H₁₄) + Dienophile (C₄H₂O₃) → Product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃). This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the major (*endo*) and minor (*exo*) products.**\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C=C double bond of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton. In other words, the anhydride ring is on the same side (syn) as the C7 bridge, but more importantly for NOE, the two methine protons at the ring junction are pointing towards the C=C bond.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented \"away\" from the C=C double bond. The methine protons at the ring junction are pointing away from the C=C bond.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the key difference in the NOESY spectra.**\n\n*   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* adduct but far apart in the *exo* adduct.\n*   Let's examine the proton environments in the product structure (which has C₂ symmetry):\n    1.  **Vinylic Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm):** The two methyl groups on the C=C bond are equivalent.\n    2.  **Bridgehead Methyls (6H singlet, ~1.0 ppm):** The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons are equivalent.\n    3.  **Anhydride Junction Protons (2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused are equivalent. Their high chemical shift is due to being alpha to two carbonyl groups.\n*   Now, let's consider the spatial proximities:\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride junction protons (3) are pointing towards the C=C bond and are therefore spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (1). This proximity will result in a clear NOE cross-peak.\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride junction protons (3) are pointing away from the C=C bond and are far from the vinylic methyl groups (1). The NOE interaction will be very weak or absent.\n\n**Step 5: Match the interacting protons with the given options.**\n\n*   The unique cross-peak in the major product connects the **anhydride junction protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm)** and the **vinylic methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n*   Let's evaluate the options:\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This exactly matches our analysis. It describes the interaction between the vinylic methyls and the anhydride junction protons.\n    *   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The \"1H doublet\" signal is inconsistent with the C₂ symmetric structure of the product.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** The \"1H doublet\" is inconsistent. Also, the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) are not close to the anhydride junction protons.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This describes an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. These groups are on opposite sides of the bicyclic system and are too far apart for a significant NOE.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
