    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring a specific value (an eigenvalue) for a given observable, when the system is in a particular quantum state. The fundamental principle to use here is the Born rule.\n\n**2. State the relevant formula**\nThe probability, `Prob(λ)`, of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for an observable operator `O` in a system described by the state vector `|ψ>` is given by:\n`Prob(λ) = |<v_λ|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`\nWhere:\n*   `|ψ>` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ>` is the normalized eigenvector of the operator `O` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `<v_λ|ψ>` is the inner product (or projection) of the state `|ψ>` onto the eigenvector `|v_λ>`.\n*   `<ψ|ψ>` is the squared norm of the state vector `|ψ>`, which serves as a normalization factor. If `|ψ>` were already normalized, this value would be 1.\n\n**3. Identify the given information**\n*   **State vector:** `|ψ>` is a column matrix `[-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n*   **Observable:** The operator `P` is the matrix:\n    ```\n    P =  [ 0   1/√2   0  ]\n         [ 1/√2  0   1/√2 ]\n         [ 0   1/√2   0  ]\n    ```\n*   **Value to be measured:** We want the probability of measuring the value `0`. This means we are interested in the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n**4. Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0**\nFirst, we must find the eigenvector `|v_0>` that satisfies the eigenvalue equation `P|v_0> = λ|v_0>`. For `λ = 0`, this becomes `P|v_0> = 0`.\nLet the eigenvector `|v_0>` be `[x, y, z]^T`.\n\n```\n[ 0   1/√2   0  ] [x]   [0]\n[ 1/√2  0   1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n[ 0   1/√2   0  ] [z]   [0]\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0`  =>  `y/√2 = 0`  =>  `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)*x + 0*y + (1/√2)*z = 0`  =>  `(x+z)/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0` (This is the same as the first equation)\n\nFrom these equations, we know `y = 0` and `x = -z`. So, any eigenvector for `λ = 0` must be of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`.\nWe can choose a simple, un-normalized eigenvector by setting `x = 1`, which gives `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\nNow, we must normalize this eigenvector. The squared norm is `1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2`. The norm is `√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v_0>` is:\n`|v_0> = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`.\n\n**5. Calculate the normalization factor for the state vector |ψ>**\nThe given state `|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T` is not normalized. We need to calculate its squared norm, `<ψ|ψ>`.\nThe bra vector `<ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ>`. Since the elements are real, it's just the row vector `[-1, 2, 1]`.\n`<ψ|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**6. Calculate the inner product <v_0|ψ>**\nNow we project the state vector `|ψ>` onto the normalized eigenvector `|v_0>`.\n*   `|v_0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T`\n*   `<v_0| = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n*   `|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\n`<v_0|ψ> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n`= (1/√2)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1)`\n`= -1/√2 - 1/√2`\n`= -2/√2`\n`= -√2`\n\n**7. Calculate the final probability**\nNow we plug all the calculated values back into the probability formula:\n`Prob(λ=0) = |<v_0|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`\n`= |(-√2)|^2 / 6`\n`= 2 / 6`\n`= 1/3`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n*   The first step in such problems is to find the specific eigenvector for the eigenvalue mentioned in the question.\n*   A common mistake is to forget that the given state vector `|ψ>` might not be normalized. Always calculate the denominator `<ψ|ψ>`.\n*   Ensure that the eigenvector `|v_λ>` used in the numerator is normalized. Alternatively, if you use an un-normalized eigenvector `|v_u>`, the formula becomes `|<v_u|ψ>|^2 / (<v_u|v_u><ψ|ψ>)`, which gives the same result.\n*   The inner product `<a|b>` involves the conjugate transpose of `|a>`. In this case, all numbers are real, so it's simply the transpose.\n*   The probability is the modulus squared of the inner product, `|c|^2`, which eliminates any complex phase and ensures the probability is a positive real number.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated probability is 1/3. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
