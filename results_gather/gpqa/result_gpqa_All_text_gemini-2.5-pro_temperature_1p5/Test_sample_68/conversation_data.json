    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for the minimum resolution of a bubble chamber required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. We are given the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), its total energy in the lab frame (E), and its rest mass ($m_0$).\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Proper lifetime of $X^0$, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame, $E = 27$ GeV.\n*   Rest mass of $X^0$, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n*   Condition: Observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Relativity:** The particle's total energy (27 GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), indicating it is moving at a highly relativistic speed. We must use the formulas of special relativity.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n3.  **Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance `l` in the lab frame is given by $N(l)/N_0 = e^{-l/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n4.  **Observing Decays:** A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. Let the resolution be $L$. For a decay to be observed, the particle's track length must be greater than $L$.\n5.  **Interpretation of \"Observe at least 30%\":** This means the probability of a particle having an observable track length must be at least 0.30. That is, $P(\\text{track length} \\geq L) \\geq 0.30$. Using the exponential decay law, this translates to $e^{-L/\\lambda} \\geq 0.30$.\n6.  **\"Minimum Resolution\":** This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean the best possible resolution (smallest $L$) or the minimum requirement for the resolution (largest possible $L$ that still satisfies the condition). In the context of the question, it's asking for the specific value of $L$ that corresponds to the boundary condition, i.e., $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy, rest mass, and lab frame.\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$) in the Lab Frame**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying in the lab frame.\n$\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\nWe know $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$ and $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nSo, $\\lambda = (\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c\\tau_0$.\nThe term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated directly as $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} = \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx 7.854$\n\nNow we can calculate $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = \\beta\\gamma \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n$\\lambda = 7.854 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution (L)**\nAs established in the careful points, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the probability of a particle's track length being greater than the resolution $L$ must be at least 30%.\n$P(\\text{track length} \\ge L) = e^{-L/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nWe solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$L = -\\lambda \\times (-1.204) = 1.204 \\times \\lambda$\n$L = 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the Given Options**\nThe calculated resolution is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest in value and order of magnitude to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (around 9%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values or the answer options. Based on the analysis, Option A is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<A>>>"
