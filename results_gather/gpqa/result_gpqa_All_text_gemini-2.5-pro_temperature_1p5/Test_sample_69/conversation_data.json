    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 and deduce the identities of B, D, and H.**\nClue 4 states: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\nThis describes a reaction between two gases (B and D) to form a liquid solvent (H). Let's consider some common reactions that fit this pattern.\n*   **Hypothesis 1:** SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂ (l, sulfuryl chloride). This fits perfectly. SO₂Cl₂ is used as a solvent. So, {B, D} could be {SO₂, Cl₂}.\n*   **Hypothesis 2:** 2PCl₃(l/g) + O₂(g) → 2POCl₃(l, phosphoryl chloride). This also fits perfectly. PCl₃ has a boiling point of 76°C, so it can be a gas. O₂ is a gas. POCl₃ is a liquid and a common solvent/reagent. The stoichiometry is 2:1, but the question says a 1:1 ratio. This might be a point of ambiguity, perhaps referring to the reactants without considering the coefficient. However, the first hypothesis (SO₂ + Cl₂) has a cleaner 1:1 stoichiometry. Let's re-examine the PCl₃ + O₂ reaction. POCl₃ can also be formed via PCl₅ + P₄O₁₀ or other routes. The direct oxidation is the most common representation, and its stoichiometry is 2:1. Let's reconsider. What if the ratio refers to the reaction D + B -> H. Maybe POCl₃ formation can be seen as PCl₃ + 'O' -> POCl₃. This is weak.\n\nLet's pause and use another clue to distinguish between these possibilities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3 and deduce the identities of F and G.**\nClue 3 states: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"\nThis is a hydrolysis reaction. The key is that the part of C that is *not* A hydrolyzes to produce a strong acid and a weak acid. This non-A part must originate from reactant B.\n*   Let's test Hypothesis 1 from Step 1, where B is either SO₂ or Cl₂.\n    *   If B = SO₂, hydrolysis gives H₂SO₃ (sulfurous acid), which is a weak acid. This only produces one acid. This doesn't fit.\n    *   If B = Cl₂, hydrolysis is a disproportionation reaction: Cl₂(g) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HCl(aq) + HClO(aq). HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid (F), and HClO (hypochlorous acid) is a weak acid (G). This is a perfect match.\n*   Let's test Hypothesis 2 from Step 1, where B = PCl₃.\n    *   Hydrolysis of PCl₃: PCl₃(l) + 3H₂O(l) → H₃PO₃(aq) + 3HCl(aq). HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid (F), and H₃PO₃ (phosphorous acid) is a weak acid (G). This is also a perfect match.\n\nSo we have two plausible scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1:** B = Cl₂, D = SO₂, H = SO₂Cl₂, F = HCl, G = HClO.\n*   **Scenario 2:** B = PCl₃, D = O₂, H = POCl₃, F = HCl, G = H₃PO₃. The 1:1 stoichiometry in Clue 4 is the only weak point for this otherwise excellent fit. Let's assume there's a rationale for it (e.g., it's a simplification or refers to a specific catalytic mechanism) and keep it as a strong contender.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3 together.**\nClue 1: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"\nClue 3: \"C reacts with water to reform A...\"\nThe fact that A is reformed upon hydrolysis of C strongly suggests that C is an adduct of A and B, i.e., C = A·(B)ₓ, or that A acts as a catalyst for the formation of C from B, with C being an oligomer/allotrope of B. The \"reforms A\" part makes the adduct model very likely. The original solid A is released unchanged when C is put in water.\n\n*   In **Scenario 1 (B=Cl₂)**, C would be an adduct of A and chlorine, A·(Cl₂)₈. A solid A forming a \"bright red\" complex with 8 molecules of Cl₂ is highly unusual and not a well-known chemical phenomenon. This scenario seems unlikely at this step.\n*   In **Scenario 2 (B=PCl₃)**, C would be an adduct of A and phosphine trichloride, A·(PCl₃)₈. PCl₃ is a known ligand in coordination chemistry. While a coordination number of 8 is high, it's possible for large central atoms. Forming a colored charge-transfer complex is plausible. This scenario remains more credible.\n\nLet's proceed assuming **Scenario 2** is the correct one.\n*   **A**: An unknown solid.\n*   **B**: PCl₃ (phosphine trichloride)\n*   **C**: A(PCl₃)₈, a bright red adduct.\n*   **D**: O₂ (oxygen)\n*   **F**: HCl (hydrochloric acid)\n*   **G**: H₃PO₃ (phosphorous acid)\n*   **H**: POCl₃ (phosphoryl chloride)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 to identify E.**\nClue 2: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\nSubstituting the identities from our working scenario:\nC [which is A·(PCl₃)₈] + 2 O₂ → E (extremely hazardous)\n\nThe reaction involves the oxidation of the PCl₃ ligands by O₂. Since the identity of A is not required to find the symmetry of E, E is likely a small molecule byproduct from the decomposition of the ligands, rather than a complex containing A.\nLet's consider the oxidation of PCl₃ by O₂.\nA simple oxidation gives POCl₃: 2PCl₃ + O₂ → 2POCl₃. This doesn't match the 1:2 stoichiometry of C to D (if interpreted as moles of PCl₃ to moles of O₂).\nLet's examine the reaction of two PCl₃ molecules with two O₂ molecules. Is it possible they form a different, more hazardous product? Consider a reaction that forms known hazardous substances and balances:\n2 PCl₃ + 2 O₂ → P₂O₃Cl₄ + Cl₂O\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   Reactants: 2 P, 6 Cl, 4 O\n    *   Products: P₂O₃Cl₄ (2 P, 4 Cl, 3 O) + Cl₂O (2 Cl, 1 O) = 2 P, 6 Cl, 4 O.\n*   The equation balances perfectly.\n*   The products are P₂O₃Cl₄ (pyrophosphoryl chloride) and Cl₂O (dichlorine monoxide). Both are known to be hazardous substances.\n\nThis suggests E could be either P₂O₃Cl₄ or Cl₂O. We need to find the molecular symmetry group.\n*   **P₂O₃Cl₄**: The structure is Cl₂(O)P-O-P(O)Cl₂. It has a bent P-O-P bridge and tetrahedral geometry at each phosphorus atom. The overall molecule has a C₂ axis passing through the bridging oxygen and bisecting the P-O-P angle, and two vertical mirror planes. This gives it **C₂ᵥ** symmetry.\n*   **Cl₂O**: The structure is bent (V-shaped), similar to water. It has a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes. This also gives it **C₂ᵥ** symmetry.\n\nSince both plausible hazardous products have C₂ᵥ symmetry, we can confidently identify the molecular symmetry group of E.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nThe most consistent chemical narrative identifies the reaction system as based on phosphorus trichloride (B) and oxygen (D). The extremely hazardous product E is formed from the oxidation of the PCl₃ ligands. A plausible, balanced reaction yields products (P₂O₃Cl₄ and Cl₂O), both of which have C₂ᵥ symmetry. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂ᵥ.\n\nComparing with the given options:\nA) D∞h\nB) D4h\nC) C2\nD) C2v\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n>>>D"
