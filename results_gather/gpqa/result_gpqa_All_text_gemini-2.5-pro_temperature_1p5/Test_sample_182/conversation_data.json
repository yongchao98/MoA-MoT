    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant.**\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **cyclohex-**: This indicates a six-membered ring structure. A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **-3-ene**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group is -CH=CH₂, which contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group is an aldehyde (-CHO), which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond also contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (carboxyl C=O) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for its ability to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\nThe effects of Red P / excess HI are:\n*   It reduces alkene double bonds (C=C) to alkane single bonds (C-C).\n*   It completely reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It completely reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It does not break the carbon-carbon single bonds that form the skeleton of the molecule, including the ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\nApplying the effects of the reagent to our reactant:\n1.  The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C double bond becomes a C-C single bond).\n2.  The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n3.  The **formyl group** (-CHO) at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n4.  The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The key point is that it is a saturated cycloalkane; all double bonds have been eliminated.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\nFor the final product (a substituted cyclohexane):\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is still present. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: The reaction has reduced all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the number of pi bonds in the product is 0.\n\nTotal IHD of the product = 1 (from the ring) + 0 (from pi bonds) = 1.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Correctly identify all sources of unsaturation in the starting material (one ring, two C=C bonds, two C=O bonds).\n*   Recognize that Red P/HI is a powerful reducing agent that reduces all these unsaturations except for the ring structure itself.\n*   Understand that the final product is a saturated cycloalkane, which means it has no pi bonds but retains its single ring.\n*   Recall that the IHD is the sum of rings and pi bonds. A simple cycloalkane will always have an IHD of 1.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
