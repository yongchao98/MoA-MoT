    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product's structure from the given NMR data.**\n\nThe product results from a reaction of Compound X (C11H12O), so it will also have the formula C11H12O, as the reaction conditions (heat, catalyst) suggest an isomerization. The degree of unsaturation for C11H12O is (2*11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 6.\n\n*   **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The absence of a proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum rules out an aldehyde, so the product must be a **ketone**. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   There are 8 carbons in the region **δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm**, which is typical for aromatic and alkene (C=C) carbons. A benzene ring uses 6 carbons and 4 degrees of unsaturation. This leaves 2 carbons and 1 degree of unsaturation, corresponding to a C=C double bond.\n    *   The signals at **δ 21.3 ppm** and **δ 28.4 ppm** are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to two carbon atoms. The ¹H NMR will clarify their nature.\n\n*   **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The signals at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** are two singlets, each integrating to three protons. These are two **methyl groups (CH₃)** that are not coupled to any adjacent protons. They must be attached to atoms with no protons, such as quaternary carbons or a carbonyl group.\n    *   The signals at **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)** form a classic AA'BB' splitting pattern. This is a very strong indicator of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The two doublets, each for 2H, represent the two pairs of equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   The signals at **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)** are two doublets, each integrating to one proton. They are coupled to each other, which is characteristic of two protons on a disubstituted double bond (**-CH=CH-**).\n\n*   **Assemble the Fragments into the Product Structure:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    1.  A ketone group (-CO-)\n    2.  A para-disubstituted benzene ring (-C₆H₄-)\n    3.  A disubstituted alkene group (-CH=CH-)\n    4.  Two methyl groups (-CH₃)\n\n    Let's combine these pieces to form a molecule with the formula C11H12O. The total atoms in the fragments (C=1, C=6, C=2, C=2) = 11 carbons and (H=4, H=2, H=6) = 12 hydrogens match the formula.\n\n    To satisfy the NMR data (specifically the two methyl singlets), one methyl group must be part of the para-disubstituted ring (a tolyl group), and the other must be an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-CO-). Let's assemble them in this way:\n    **Structure: 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one** (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃)\n\n    Let's check this proposed structure against the NMR data:\n    *   **Two methyl singlets:** Yes, the tolyl-CH₃ (~2.3 ppm) and the acetyl-CH₃ (~2.2 ppm) would both be singlets. This perfectly matches the signals at δ 2.28 and 2.31.\n    *   **para-disubstituted ring:** Yes, the p-tolyl group gives an AA'BB' pattern. This matches the signals at δ 7.08 and 7.71.\n    *   **-CH=CH- group:** Yes, the protons on the double bond are coupled only to each other, appearing as two doublets. This matches the signals at δ 6.75 and 7.68.\n    *   **Ketone:** Yes, an α,β-unsaturated ketone is consistent with the ¹³C signal at δ 197.7 ppm.\n\n    This structure is fully consistent with all features of the provided NMR spectra.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound X by relating it to the product.**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization, so Compound X must be an isomer of 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Critically, it must contain the same non-rearranging structural elements, particularly the **p-tolyl group (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-)**.\n\nLet's examine the options for Compound X:\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound contains a styryl group, which has a phenyl ring (C₆H₅-), not a p-tolyl ring. It cannot isomerize to the product.\n*   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound also contains a phenyl ring, not a p-tolyl ring. It cannot isomerize to the product.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-. This compound contains the required **p-tolyl group**. Its structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. It has the formula C11H12O. This compound is a vinyl epoxide which can undergo rearrangement to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. This is the only plausible starting material.\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** This compound has the formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the product of the reaction is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. The only starting material listed that could isomerize to this product is the one that also contains a p-tolyl group, which is option C. The reaction described is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an unsaturated ketone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
