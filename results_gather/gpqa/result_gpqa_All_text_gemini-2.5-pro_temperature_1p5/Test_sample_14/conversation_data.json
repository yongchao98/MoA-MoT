    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which planet has the highest probability of transiting.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 (P_1) and Planet_2 (P_2) to decide which one is more favorable to observe. We need to calculate the ratio P_1 / P_2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its host star is given by the formula:\n    *   `P_transit ≈ R_star / a`\n    *   where `R_star` is the radius of the host star and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **List the Given Information and Define Variables:**\n    *   Let the orbital period of Planet_1 be `T_1` and that of Planet_2 be `T_2`.\n    *   Let the mass of the host star of Planet_1 be `M_s1` and that of Planet_2 be `M_s2`.\n    *   Let the radius of the host star of Planet_1 be `R_s1` and that of Planet_2 be `R_s2`.\n    *   Let the semi-major axis of Planet_1's orbit be `a_1` and that of Planet_2 be `a_2`.\n\n    From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:\n    *   `T_2 = 3 * T_1` (Period of Planet_2 is three times that of Planet_1)\n    *   `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` (Mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2)\n    *   `R_s1 = R_s2` (The host stars have the same radii)\n    *   *Careful point:* The fact that the planets have the same mass is extra information and is not needed for calculating the geometric transit probability.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2.\n    *   `P_1 ≈ R_s1 / a_1`\n    *   `P_2 ≈ R_s2 / a_2`\n    *   Ratio = `P_1 / P_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\n    Since we are given that `R_s1 = R_s2`, the stellar radii cancel out:\n    *   Ratio = `P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`\n    *   *Careful point:* Notice that the probability ratio is the *inverse* of the semi-major axis ratio. A smaller orbit (smaller 'a') leads to a higher transit probability.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-major Axis to Physical Properties using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (`T`), semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_star`). The law can be expressed as:\n    *   `T² / a³ ∝ 1 / M_star`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `a`, we get: `a³ ∝ M_star * T²`\n    *   Therefore, `a ∝ (M_star * T²)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes (a₂ / a₁):** Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up the ratio for our two systems:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * T_2²) / (M_s1 * T_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Known Relationships:** Now, substitute the given relationships (`T_2 = 3 * T_1` and `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`) into the equation:\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * T_1)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * T_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   *Careful point:* Ensure the squares and substitutions are applied correctly. `(3 * T_1)² = 9 * T_1²`.\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * T_1²) / (2 * M_s2 * T_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   The `M_s2` and `T_1²` terms cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   We need to find the cube root of 4.5.\n    *   `1.6³ = 4.096`\n    *   `1.7³ = 4.913`\n    *   The value is very close to 1.65. A calculator gives `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096...`\n    *   So, `a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`.\n\n10. **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We found that the probability ratio is `P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1`.\n    *   Substituting the value we calculated: `P_1 / P_2 ≈ 1.65`.\n    *   This result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately **1.65 times higher** than the probability of Planet_2 transiting.\n    *   Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n11. **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n\nThe analysis confirms that option D is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
