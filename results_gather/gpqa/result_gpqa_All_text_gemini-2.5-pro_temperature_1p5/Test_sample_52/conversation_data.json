    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided.**\n\n1.  **General Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n2.  **FTIR Data:** There is an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms, and it also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n3.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **6 total signals:** This indicates there are 6 types of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents in the *para* (1,4) positions would typically show two signals (often two doublets). This is the most likely substitution pattern. This C6H4 group accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group.\n        *   The hydrogen on the carbon next to the CH3 group would be split by the adjacent vinyl hydrogen (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl hydrogen would be split only by its neighboring vinyl hydrogen, giving a doublet (d).\n        *   This propenyl group fragment is C3H5.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** This means there are two methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n    *   **No -CH2- signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the molecular fragments.**\n\nWe have the following pieces to build our molecule:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring core (C6H4).\n*   An ester functional group (-COO-).\n*   A propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   A methyl group (-CH3) that is not part of the propenyl group.\n*   The constraint of no -CH2- groups.\n\nLet's assemble the two substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   **Substituent 1:** This is the propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n*   **Substituent 2:** This must contain the ester group and the second methyl group. To incorporate the -CH3 and -COO- fragments without creating a -CH2- group, there are two possibilities for how it attaches to the aromatic ring:\n    1.  A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n    2.  An acetate group: -OCOCH3\n\nBoth potential substituents, -COOCH3 and -OCOCH3, fulfill the conditions: they contain an ester, a methyl group, and no methylene group. Therefore, the overall structure is a benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group and either a -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3 group. A likely structure is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate or Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. Both of these structures fit all the spectral data provided.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total chemical formula.**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from the identified parts to find the molecular formula. The formula will be the same regardless of which of the two possible ester arrangements is correct.\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n*   **Substituent 1 (propenyl group):** C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n*   **Substituent 2 (ester part):** This will be either -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3. In both cases, the fragment consists of C2H3O2.\n\nLet's add them up:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the calculated formula with the given options.**\n\n*   A) C12H12O2\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C12H14O2\n*   D) C11H12O2\n\nOur calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n**Careful Points & Final Check:**\n\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** A good way to verify the result.\n    *   Formula C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Structure: Benzene ring (4 DoU) + one C=C double bond (1 DoU) + one C=O double bond (1 DoU) = 6 DoU. The DoU values match, confirming our structural analysis is consistent with the formula.\n*   **Ruled-out options:** The other options can be ruled out. C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have too many hydrogens and would require -CH2- groups, which are explicitly stated to be absent. C12H12O2 has an extra degree of unsaturation that cannot be explained by the given NMR fragments.\n\n<<<D>>>"
