    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere.\n\n**1. Understand the physical setup:**\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded\", which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0).\n*   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. Since `q` is typically assumed to be positive, negative charges will be attracted to the side of the sphere closer to `q`, and positive charges will be repelled to the other side. However, since the sphere is grounded, it's connected to an infinite reservoir of charge (the Earth). The repelled positive charges will flow away to the ground, leaving a net negative induced charge on the sphere.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Method:**\n*   **Method of Images:** This is a powerful technique to solve electrostatic problems involving charges and conductors. The basic idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the conductor's surface with one or more fictitious \"image charges\" placed *inside* the volume originally occupied by the conductor. These image charges, along with the original external charges, must satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem.\n*   **Boundary Condition:** For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential on its surface (at any point a distance `R` from the center) must be zero. V(r=R) = 0.\n*   **Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. In this case, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center, while the sphere is maintained at V=0.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Image Charge and its Location**\n\nWe need to find an image charge `q'` at a position `d'` from the center such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n*   Let the center of the sphere be the origin.\n*   Let the charge `q` be on the z-axis at z = `d`.\n*   Let the image charge `q'` be on the z-axis at z = `d'`. `d'` must be inside the sphere (`d' < R`).\n*   The potential at any point P on the surface of the sphere due to `q` and `q'` must be zero.\n    *   Potential due to `q`: V_q = k * q / (distance from q to P)\n    *   Potential due to `q'`: V_q' = k * q' / (distance from q' to P)\n*   The condition is V_q + V_q' = 0 on the surface r=R.\n*   Through standard derivation (by enforcing this condition for all points on the sphere), we find the following for the image charge and its position:\n    *   **Position of image charge:** `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`, and it is located inside the sphere on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. It is a fictitious charge used for calculation; the real induced charge is distributed on the surface.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on `q` during this process is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The field produced by these induced charges (outside the sphere) is identical to the field produced by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the energy:\n\n**Method A: Using the formula U = (1/2) qV**\nThe interaction energy of a charge `q` with a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n*   The potential created by the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n*   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n*   The location of `q'` is at distance `d'` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d'`.\n*   The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n*   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `d - d' = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   Now, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution itself builds up as `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is not simply `q * V_final_potential` but involves an integral that results in this factor of `1/2`.\n\n**Method B: Integrating the Force**\nThe work done is the integral of the external force required to move the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic force.\n*   The force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is equal to the force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2` where the charge is at a variable position `x`.\n    `x' = R^2/x` and `q' = -qR/x`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` (This is an attractive force).\n*   The potential energy `U(d)` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`.\n    `U(d) = W = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_external · dx = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_electrostatic · dx`\n    `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n*   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`.\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * ∫ [ (1/2) du / u^2 ] = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]`\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞ ]`\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nOur calculated potential energy is: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)  -> Incorrect.\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) -> Incorrect, has R^2.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) -> **Correct.**\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)          -> Incorrect, missing the 1/2 factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is correctly calculated using the method of images, resulting in the interaction energy between the charge `q` and the potential created by its image charge `q'`, with an additional factor of 1/2. The final expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
