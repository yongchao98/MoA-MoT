    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n*   We have a point charge `q` with a time-dependent position vector `s(t)`.\n*   We want to find the electromagnetic potentials, scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A`, at a specific observation point `r` and time `t`.\n*   The electromagnetic field (and thus the potentials) that we observe at `(r, t)` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n*   The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for the signal to travel at the speed of light `c` from the source's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n**2. Define Key Quantities**\n*   **Retarded position of the charge:** `s(tr)`.\n*   **Retarded velocity of the charge:** `v = ds(t')/dt' |_(t'=tr)`.\n*   **Vector from source to observer:** The problem defines `d` as the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point. So, `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   **Distance from source to observer:** The magnitude of the vector `d` is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   **Retarded time condition:** The time delay for the signal is `d/c`. Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is determined by the implicit equation:\n    `t - tr = d/c`  or  `tr = t - d/c = t - |r - s(tr)|/c`.\n\n**3. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials**\nThe solutions to Maxwell's equations for the potentials from a time-varying charge density `ρ` and current density `J` are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    where `tr = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\n**4. Apply to a Point Charge**\nFor a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q v(t') δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and evaluating the integrals (a non-trivial process that involves a change of variables and properties of the delta function) yields the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n**5. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe result of the integration is:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]_tr`\n    The subscript `tr` means all quantities inside the bracket (`d`, `d`, `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n    This expression can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d ⋅ v)]_tr`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d ⋅ v / c)]_tr`\n    Similarly, rewriting this gives:\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (dc - d ⋅ v)]_tr`\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\nLet's analyze the options based on our derived expressions. Our notation (`d`, `d`, `v`, `tr`) matches that defined in the problem.\n\n*   **A) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect. The potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge. It also uses `r` (distance from origin) instead of `d` (distance from the retarded source position).\n\n*   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc + d ⋅ v))**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. It should be `(dc - d ⋅ v)`. A plus sign corresponds to advanced potentials, which are generally considered unphysical as they violate causality.\n\n*   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**\n    This is incorrect. `V` is the static potential, and the relation for `A` is dimensionally and vectorially wrong (`A` is a vector, but `v²V` is a scalar).\n\n*   **D) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))**\n    This option perfectly matches the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    Let's also check the relationship between `A` and `V`. Using `c² = 1/(μ₀ε₀)`, we have `μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)`.\n    `A = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    `A = (1/(ε₀c²)) * (qc v) / (4π (dc - d ⋅ v))`\n    `A = (v/c²) * [qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d ⋅ v))]`\n    `A = (v/c²) V`\n    The expressions in D are self-consistent and correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Option D provides the correct mathematical forms for these potentials using the specified notation.\n\nThe denominator term `(dc - d ⋅ v)` is a relativistic correction factor that accounts for the fact that the \"news\" from the moving charge is compressed or rarefied, similar to the Doppler effect for sound or light waves.\n\n<<<D>>>"
