    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Decay Process\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V\n*   **Participants:**\n    *   A, B: Heavy nucleons or nuclei. The initial system containing 2A decays into a final system containing 2B.\n    *   E, V: Lighter particles created in the decay.\n*   **Energy Release (Q-value):** In any nuclear decay, the total mass of the initial particles is greater than the total mass of the final particles. This mass difference is converted into energy (rest mass of newly created particles + kinetic energy of all final particles). Let's define the total energy released by the change in the heavy particles as `E_release`.\n    `E_release = Mass(2A)c² - Mass(2B)c²`\n*   **Energy Conservation:** This released energy `E_release` is distributed among the final particles.\n    `E_release = E_total(2E) + E_total(2V) + T(2B)`\n    where:\n    *   `E_total(2E)` is the total energy (kinetic + rest mass) of the two E particles.\n    *   `E_total(2V)` is the total energy (kinetic + rest mass) of the two V particles.\n    *   `T(2B)` is the recoil kinetic energy of the heavy B system. Since B is heavy, its recoil energy is very small and can be neglected for this analysis (`T(2B) ≈ 0`).\n    So, `E_release ≈ E_total(2E) + E_total(2V)`.\n*   **Nature of the Spectrum:** The equation `E_release ≈ E_total(2E) + E_total(2V)` shows that the total energy is shared between the E particles and the V particles. `E_total(2E)` can take any value as long as `E_total(2V)` takes the remaining energy. This sharing of energy among three or more final-state particles is what leads to a **continuous** energy spectrum.\n*   **Endpoint of the Spectrum (Q_original):** The question defines the endpoint as `Q`. This is the maximum possible total energy for the two E particles, `(E_total(2E))_max`. This maximum is achieved when the other particles carry away the minimum possible energy.\n    *   The minimum kinetic energy for the two V particles is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum total energy for the two V particles is the sum of their rest masses: `(E_total(2V))_min = 2 * m_V * c²`.\n    *   So, the maximum energy for the E particles is:\n        `Q_original = (E_total(2E))_max ≈ E_release - (E_total(2V))_min = E_release - 2m_V c²`\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Variant Decay Process\n\n*   **Reaction:** 2A -> 2B + 2E + M\n*   **Participants:**\n    *   A, B, E are the same as before.\n    *   M is an exotic, **massless** particle (`m_M = 0`).\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The initial and final heavy particles (A and B) are the same, so the `E_release` is identical to the original decay.\n    `E_release = E_total(2E) + E_total(M) + T(2B)`\n    *   `E_total(M)` is the total energy of the M particle. Since M is massless, its energy is purely kinetic (`E_total(M) = T_M`).\n    *   Again, we neglect the recoil `T(2B)`.\n    So, `E_release ≈ E_total(2E) + E_total(M)`.\n*   **Nature of the Spectrum:** The energy `E_release` is now shared between the E particles and the single M particle. Since the energy is still shared between multiple components, the energy spectrum for the E particles remains **continuous**. The exact distribution (\"shape\") of the spectrum will be different because the phase space of the final state has changed (fewer particles).\n*   **Endpoint of the Spectrum (Q_variant):** We find the maximum total energy for the two E particles, `(E_total(2E))_max`. This occurs when the massless particle M carries away the minimum possible energy.\n    *   The minimum energy for a massless particle is zero (`(E_total(M))_min = 0`).\n    *   So, the maximum energy for the E particles is:\n        `Q_variant = (E_total(2E))_max ≈ E_release - (E_total(M))_min = E_release - 0 = E_release`\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Two Decays\n\n*   **Spectrum Type:**\n    *   Original: Continuous.\n    *   Variant: Continuous.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The spectrum remains continuous. This eliminates options A and D. The shape is adjusted because the number and masses of the final state particles are different.\n\n*   **Endpoint Value:**\n    *   Original Endpoint: `Q_original = E_release - 2m_V c²`\n    *   Variant Endpoint: `Q_variant = E_release`\n    *   **Comparison:** The problem describes V as a \"lighter particle\" in contrast to M which is \"massless\". This implies that V has a non-zero rest mass (`m_V > 0`). Therefore, the term `2m_V c²` is positive.\n    *   `Q_variant = Q_original + 2m_V c²`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The endpoint of the spectrum in the variant decay is higher than in the original decay (`Q_variant > Q_original`). The endpoint **increases**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings:\n1.  The energy spectrum of the E particles remains **continuous**, but its shape is adjusted due to the different final state.\n2.  The endpoint of this spectrum **increases**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
