    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **Particle Type:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n2.  **Identical Particles:** Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For an electron in a 1D box, a quantum state is defined by both its energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and its spin state (*m_s* = +1/2 or -1/2).\n4.  **State Occupancy:** As a consequence of the Pauli principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n5.  **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by E_n = n² * (π²ħ²/2mL²). The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ²/2mL², so the energy of the n-th level is simply E_n = n²E.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n**Step 1: List the single-particle energy levels.**\nUsing the formula E_n = n²E, we can list the first few energy levels:\n*   E₁ (n=1) = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ (n=2) = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ (n=3) = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ (n=4) = 4²E = 16E\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ground State Energy.**\nTo find the ground state, we must place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   The n=1 level can hold two particles.\n*   The n=2 level can hold two particles.\n*   We place two particles in the n=1 level and the remaining two particles in the n=2 level.\n*   The total energy of the ground state (E_gs) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\n    E_gs = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the First Excited State Energy.**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (in the ground state) to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   Highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   Lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state (E_1st) is:\n    E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    E_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy.**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible single-particle excitations from the ground state and find the second-lowest energy.\n*   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Excite one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest unoccupied level, n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Excite one particle from n=2 to the next unoccupied level, n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility 4 (two-particle excitation):** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
