    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\n1.  **Core Event:** The `pp-III` branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops.\n2.  **Timing:** This event happened ~8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the effects of this change are just now being observed on Earth.\n3.  **Constraint:** All other reactions, specifically `pp-I`, `pp-II`, and the CNO cycle, remain unchanged. This is a crucial simplifying assumption.\n4.  **Objective:** Calculate the ratio of the neutrino flux in energy Band 1 (700-800 keV) to the flux in energy Band 2 (800-900 keV). Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2).\n5.  **Simplification:** Neutrino flavor oscillations do not play a role, meaning we can consider the fluxes as they are produced in the Sun.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy\n\nWe need to know which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the energy ranges of interest (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV).\n\n*   **`pp` neutrinos (`p+p → d+e⁺+νₑ`)**: Continuous spectrum with a maximum energy of 420 keV. These are **below** both bands.\n*   **`⁷Be` neutrinos (`⁷Be+e⁻ → ⁷Li+νₑ`)**: This reaction is part of the `pp-II` branch. It produces monoenergetic (line) neutrinos. The primary line is at **862 keV**. This falls squarely **inside Band 2 (800-900 keV)**. According to the problem, the `pp-II` branch continues as normal.\n*   **`⁸B` neutrinos (`⁸B → ⁸Be*+e⁺+νₑ`)**: This reaction is the final step of the `pp-III` branch. It produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with very high energy (up to ~15 MeV). These neutrinos contribute to the flux in **both Band 1 and Band 2**. However, the problem states that the `pp-III` branch **stops**. Therefore, the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos becomes **zero**.\n*   **CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N`, `¹⁵O`)**: These have continuous spectra with maximum energies of 1.20 MeV (`¹³N`) and 1.73 MeV (`¹⁵O`). They contribute to the flux in **both Band 1 and Band 2**. The problem states these reactions continue as normal.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Flux in Each Band After the Change\n\nWith the `pp-III` branch stopped, the `⁸B` neutrino flux is zero. We must now evaluate the remaining sources for each band.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The only remaining contributors are the CNO cycle neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`).\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)`\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The strong monoenergetic line from `⁷Be` decay at 862 keV is still present because the `pp-II` branch is unaffected.\n    *   There is also a contribution from the CNO cycle neutrinos in this range.\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be(862 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)`\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Magnitudes and Calculate the Ratio\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to compare the magnitude of the `⁷Be` line flux with the CNO continuous spectrum flux.\n\n1.  **`⁷Be` Flux**: This is a very strong source. The flux is concentrated entirely at a single energy (862 keV), which lies within Band 2. The standard solar model predicts a total `⁷Be` neutrino flux of approximately 5 × 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second.\n2.  **CNO Flux**: The CNO cycle is a minor energy source in the Sun compared to the pp-chain. The total fluxes of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos are about 3 × 10⁸ and 2 × 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s, respectively. This flux is spread out over a wide energy range (up to 1.73 MeV).\n3.  **Flux Density**: The flux from the CNO reactions is spread out, so its flux density (flux per keV) is relatively low. In contrast, the `⁷Be` flux is a line spectrum, meaning its flux density at 862 keV is effectively infinite (or, practically, all of its flux is in a very narrow band).\n\nLet's make an order-of-magnitude estimate:\n*   `Flux(Band 2)` is dominated by the `⁷Be` line. The CNO contribution in this 100 keV window is negligible in comparison.\n    *   `Flux(Band 2) ≈ Flux_⁷Be ≈ 5 × 10⁹`\n*   `Flux(Band 1)` consists only of the CNO neutrinos in that 100 keV window. The total CNO flux (~5 × 10⁸) is spread over an energy range of roughly 1.7 MeV (1700 keV). The flux in a 100 keV window is a small fraction of the total.\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) ≈ (Total CNO Flux / Energy Range) * Window Size`\n    *   `Flux(Band 1) ≈ (5 × 10⁸ / 1700 keV) * 100 keV ≈ 3 × 10⁷`\n    *   (A simpler estimate assuming the flux is spread over ~1000 keV gives `(5 × 10⁸ / 1000) * 100 = 5 × 10⁷`). Both estimates are on the same order of magnitude.\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n`Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) ≈ (5 × 10⁷) / (5 × 10⁹)`\n`Ratio ≈ 10⁻² = 0.01`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) is completely dominated by the very intense `⁷Be` neutrino line, which is unaffected by the change. The flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) is composed only of the much weaker, continuously distributed CNO neutrinos. Therefore, the flux in Band 1 is significantly smaller than the flux in Band 2, by approximately two orders of magnitude.\n\nFinal Ratio: `Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV) ≈ 0.01`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
