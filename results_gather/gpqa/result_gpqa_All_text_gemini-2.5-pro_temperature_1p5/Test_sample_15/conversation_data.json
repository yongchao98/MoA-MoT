    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound that rotates the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups). A compound with chiral centers can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, which possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound.\n\n**1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n       Cl   CH3\n        \\  /\n         C==C\n        /  \\\n       H   CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:** This molecule is an alkene. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) cannot be chiral centers. C3 (in the ethyl group) is a CH2, and C4 is a CH3, neither are chiral. The methyl group attached to C2 is also not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\n**2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n*   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS). These R/S descriptors are used to specify the absolute configuration of specific stereocenters in a single enantiomer. A compound that is designated as a specific enantiomer (like (R)- or (S)-) is by definition chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single, non-racemic enantiomer, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n**3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n*   **Analysis:** The name specifies the stereochemistry as (2R, 3S). Let's examine the symmetry of this stereoisomer. In this molecule, the two halves (from the center of the C2-C3 bond) are mirror images of each other. The molecule has an internal plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    ```\n         COOH\n          |\n    H----|----CH3  (S)\n          |\n   CH3---|----H    (R)  <-- My assignment here might be off, but the relative R,S config makes it meso\n          |\n         COOH\n    ```\n    With (2R, 3S) or (2S, 3R) configurations, the molecule is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso compound, which is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n*   **Structure:** Same molecular formula as above, but with a different stereochemistry.\n*   **Analysis:** The stereochemistry is specified as (2R, 3R). This stereoisomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, and the two are non-superimposable enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion:** As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, (2R, 3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **optically active**.\n\n**5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and a hydroxyl group at C1.\n*   **Analysis:** The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a -CH2-CH= group (path towards C2), and a -CH2-CH2-CH= group (path towards C6). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the (R) configuration, indicating we are considering a single enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, so it is **optically active**.\n\n**6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor (1s,3s,5s) implies a specific relative stereochemistry, typically that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n*   **Analysis:** The all-cis-1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3 axis) and three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n*   **Structure:** cyclopentyl-CO-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂-CO-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl groups (-CH₃). Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon in the chain or in the cyclopentyl ring is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically Active:\n    1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Not Optically Active:\n    1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    2.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    3.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    4.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
