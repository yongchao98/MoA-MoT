    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile precursor):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The α-protons between the two ester groups are highly acidic.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base used to deprotonate the dimethyl malonate.\n\n2.  **Step-by-step Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Enolate Formation.** The ethoxide ion (EtO⁻) removes a proton from the active methylene group of dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt ⇌ Na⁺ ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + EtOH\n    *   **Step 2: Conjugate Addition.** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group.\n        The nucleophile ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ attacks the β-carbon of p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Step 3: Protonation.** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) at the α-carbon to yield the final neutral product (A).\n        p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of A:**\n    *   The final product is: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃\n    *   To name this compound, we identify the main chain that incorporates the maximum number of principal functional groups (the esters). We can name it as a substituted propane-tricarboxylate.\n    *   The propane backbone is C1-C2-C3. Let C2 be the carbon bearing the p-tolyl group. This carbon comes from the β-carbon of the acceptor. C1 is the carbon from the malonate that has two ester groups. C3 is the α-carbon of the acceptor, which is now part of a -CH₂-COOCH₃ group.\n    *   Let's reconstruct the structure based on the IUPAC name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\":\n        *   Parent chain: Propane (C1-C2-C3).\n        *   Tricarboxylate: Three -COOCH₃ groups.\n        *   Positions 1,1,3: Two -COOCH₃ groups on C1, one on C3. The structure is (MeOOC)₂CH¹-C²H₂-C³H₂COOMe.\n        *   Substituent \"2-(p-tolyl)\": A p-tolyl group is on C2.\n        *   This gives the structure: (MeOOC)₂CH¹-C²H(p-tolyl)-C³H₂COOMe.\n    *   This structure exactly matches the product derived from the mechanism.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Reaction):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (bonded to the methyl group) is electrophilic.\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is followed by acidic workup (H₃O⁺) to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium ion back to a ketone.\n\n2.  **Step-by-step Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Conjugate Addition.** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a C-C bond and generates an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2: Proton Transfer.** The resulting carbanion (at the α-position of the nitrile) is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3: Hydrolysis.** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion. The C=N⁺ bond is cleaved, and a C=O group is formed, regenerating the cyclohexanone carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Name of B:**\n    *   The reaction starts with a cyclohexanone equivalent (the enamine) and adds a substituent at the α-position (C2).\n    *   The Michael acceptor, CH₃-CH=CH-CN, becomes the substituent group -CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN after the addition and protonation steps.\n    *   The final product (B) is a cyclohexanone ring with a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group at the 2-position.\n    *   Let's name this product. It can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is CN-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-. Numbering from the nitrile carbon as C1, the substituent is on C3. The substituent is the (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   For cyclic ketones, the keto form is significantly more stable than the enol form under neutral or acidic conditions. The H₃O⁺ workup ensures the formation of the ketone.\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Working Backwards):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition that forms the given product. We need to identify the unknown reactant C.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK), CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   **Base:** KOH.\n\n2.  **Step-by-step Deconstruction:**\n    *   A Michael addition forms a C-C bond between the β-carbon of the acceptor and the α-carbon of a donor's enolate.\n    *   Let's identify the fragment that comes from the acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃). When it undergoes Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (CH₂), and the α-carbon (CH) gets protonated. The resulting fragment is -CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   The name of this group is (3-oxobutyl), which matches the substituent on the product.\n    *   This substituent is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring.\n    *   This means the Michael donor (reactant C) must be the molecule that provided the cyclohexane-1,3-dione part and was nucleophilic at C2.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are highly acidic because they are located between two carbonyl groups (an active methylene group). The base (KOH) deprotonates this position to form a stable enolate, which then acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of C:**\n    *   The Michael donor is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   It is worth noting that β-dicarbonyl compounds like this exist in equilibrium with their enol tautomer (in this case, 3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one). However, both tautomers yield the same enolate upon deprotonation and are referred to by the diketone name.\n    *   Therefore, **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nComparing this with the given options, we find that option D correctly identifies all three species.\n\n*   A) A = incorrect, B = incorrect (enol form), C = incorrect name\n*   B) A = correct, B = correct, C = incorrect name\n*   C) A = incorrect, B = incorrect (enol form), C = correct\n*   D) A = correct, B = correct, C = correct\n\n<<<D>>>"
