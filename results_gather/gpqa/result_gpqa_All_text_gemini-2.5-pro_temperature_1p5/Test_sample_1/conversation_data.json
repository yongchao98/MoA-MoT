    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   The structure is a phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a *trans*-propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO).\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms in *trans*-cinnamaldehyde:\n        *   Phenyl ring: 6 carbons\n        *   Propenal chain (-CH=CH-CHO): 3 carbons\n        *   Total carbons in starting material = 6 + 3 = 9 carbons.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), forming product 1.\n    *   This is a Grignard reaction. The nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻) from the Grignard reagent attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.\n    *   An implicit aqueous workup follows, which protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form an alcohol.\n    *   The reaction adds the methyl group from the Grignard reagent to the carbon skeleton.\n    *   Number of carbons added = 1 (from CH₃).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted into a secondary alcohol with an added methyl group (-CH(OH)CH₃).\n    *   **Product 1:** The structure is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol.\n    *   **Carbon count for Product 1:** 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from methylmagnesium bromide) = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), forming product 2.\n    *   Product 1 is a secondary alcohol (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol).\n    *   PCC is an oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones.\n    *   This reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms; it only changes the functional group by removing two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Product 2:** The secondary alcohol group is oxidized to a ketone. The structure is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one.\n    *   **Carbon count for Product 2:** 10 carbons (no change from Product 1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO, forming product 3. (Note: The question has a typo \"3 was treated...\", which should logically be \"Product 2 was treated...\")\n    *   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the systematic IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂]. This is a sulfur ylide known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 2 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one) is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Corey-Chaykovsky reaction. When an α,β-unsaturated ketone reacts with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, the ylide adds its methylene group (–CH₂–) across the carbon-carbon double bond (a 1,4-conjugate addition followed by cyclization) to form a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   This reaction adds one carbon atom (the methylene group) to the molecule.\n    *   **Product 3:** The structure is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Carbon count for Product 3:** 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the ylide's CH₂ group) = 11 carbons.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracking the carbon atoms through each step of the reaction sequence:\n*   Start: 9 carbons\n*   After Reaction 1: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n*   After Reaction 2: 10 carbons (no change)\n*   After Reaction 3: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThe final product, product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
