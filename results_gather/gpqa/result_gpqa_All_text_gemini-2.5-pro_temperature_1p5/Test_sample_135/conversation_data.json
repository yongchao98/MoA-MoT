    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field `f`. The integral is `I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field `f`:**\n    *   The problem states the field `f` falls off radially as `1/r^2`.\n    *   It has a non-zero component only along the radial direction.\n    *   In spherical coordinates, a vector field is expressed as `f = f_r * r̂ + f_θ * θ̂ + f_φ * φ̂`, where `r̂, θ̂, φ̂` are the unit vectors.\n    *   From the problem description, `f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`, and the magnitude `|f| = f_r = 1/r^2`.\n    *   Therefore, the vector field is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`.\n\n3.  **Define the Volume of Integration `V`:**\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n4.  **Choose a Method:** There are two primary methods to solve this:\n    *   **Method A:** Directly calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then perform the volume integration.\n    *   **Method B:** Use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume.\n\n### Analysis using Method A (Direct Calculation)\n\n*   **Step A1: Calculate the Divergence `∇ ⋅ f`**\n    *   The formula for the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is:\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * f_r) + (1/(r sin θ)) * ∂/∂θ (f_θ * sin θ) + (1/(r sin θ)) * ∂/∂φ (f_φ)`\n    *   Substituting our field components (`f_r = 1/r^2`, `f_θ = 0`, `f_φ = 0`):\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2))`\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1)`\n    *   The derivative of a constant (1) with respect to `r` is zero.\n        `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * 0 = 0`.\n\n*   **Step A2: A Careful Point - The Singularity**\n    *   The calculation above is valid for all points where `r > 0`. However, the vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` is undefined, or singular, at the origin (`r = 0`). The volume of integration is a sphere of radius `R` *centered at the origin*, which means this singular point is included in our volume.\n    *   When a singularity exists, we cannot naively assume the divergence is zero everywhere. The divergence of this specific field is a special case and is represented by a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r̂ / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional delta function, which is zero everywhere except at the origin.\n\n*   **Step A3: Evaluate the Integral**\n    *   We now substitute the correct divergence into the integral:\n        `I = ∫∫∫_V (4πδ³(r)) dV`\n    *   By the definition of the Dirac delta function, integrating it over a volume that contains the origin (`r=0`) gives the value of the function multiplying it, evaluated at the origin. Here, the function is the constant `4π`.\n        `I = 4π * ∫∫∫_V δ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`.\n\n### Analysis using Method B (Divergence Theorem)\n\n*   **Step B1: State the Divergence Theorem**\n    *   The theorem states: `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`, where `S` is the closed surface that bounds the volume `V`.\n    *   In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n*   **Step B2: Address the Singularity**\n    *   As noted before, the field `f` is singular at `r=0`. The Divergence Theorem requires the field to be well-behaved throughout the volume. However, we can apply it by calculating the flux through the outer boundary surface `S`. The result of this surface integral will be equal to the volume integral of the divergence, effectively capturing the contribution from the source at the singularity.\n\n*   **Step B3: Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n    *   We need to compute `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere of radius `R`, the vector field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element vector `dS` for a sphere points in the outward radial direction, so `dS = dS * r̂`. In spherical coordinates, its magnitude is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    *   So, `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   Now we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = ((1/R^2) * r̂) ⋅ ((R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂)`\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (r̂ ⋅ r̂)`\n    *   Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the `R^2` terms cancel out, leaving:\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **Step B4: Evaluate the Integral**\n    *   `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫(φ from 0 to 2π) ∫(θ from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   First, integrate with respect to `θ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Next, integrate with respect to `φ`:\n        `∫(from 0 to 2π) (2) dφ = 2 * [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`.\n    *   Thus, the surface integral is `4π`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result.\n\n*   Direct calculation of the divergence requires knowledge of the Dirac delta function to handle the singularity, giving `4π`.\n*   Using the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral is transformed into a surface integral of the flux. The flux through the sphere of radius `R` is calculated to be `4π`.\n\nThe final answer is `4π`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
