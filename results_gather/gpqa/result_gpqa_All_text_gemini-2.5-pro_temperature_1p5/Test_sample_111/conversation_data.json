    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state |alpha>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to |ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. To find the normalized state |alpha>, we first need to calculate the squared norm of |ψ>.\nIn the basis {|up>, |down>}, where |up> = [1, 0]^T and |down> = [0, 1]^T, the state |ψ> can be written as the column vector:\n|ψ> = [1+i, 2-i]^T\n\nThe inner product <ψ|ψ> is calculated as follows:\n<ψ|ψ> = |1+i|² + |2-i|²\n<ψ|ψ> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²)\n<ψ|ψ> = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe normalization constant N is 1/sqrt(<ψ|ψ>), so N = 1/√7.\nThe normalized state |alpha> is:\n|alpha> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and Aij = 0 otherwise. In the 2x2 basis of spin-up and spin-down, the matrix is:\nA = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]\nThis can be written as A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. This is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, A = (hbar/2)σ_x.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet( [[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]] ) = 0\n(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0\nλ² - (hbar/2)² = 0\nλ = ± hbar/2\n\nSo, the two eigenvalues are:\nλ₁ = +hbar/2\nλ₂ = -hbar/2\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\nFor λ₁ = +hbar/2:\n(A - λ₁I) |a₁> = 0\n[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] [v₁, v₂]^T = [0, 0]^T\nThis gives the equation -v₁ + v₂ = 0, or v₁ = v₂. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, 1]^T.\nNormalizing this vector: N = 1/√(1²+1²) = 1/√2.\nThe first eigenstate is |a₁> = (1/√2) [1, 1]^T = (1/√2) (|up> + |down>).\n\nFor λ₂ = -hbar/2:\n(A - λ₂I) |a₂> = 0\n[[ hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] [v₁, v₂]^T = [0, 0]^T\nThis gives the equation v₁ + v₂ = 0, or v₁ = -v₂. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1]^T.\nNormalizing this vector: N = 1/√(1²+(-1)²) = 1/√2.\nThe second eigenstate is |a₂> = (1/√2) [1, -1]^T = (1/√2) (|up> - |down>).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate**\n\nThe probability P_k of measuring the eigenvalue λ_k is given by P_k = |<a_k|alpha>|².\n\nProbability P₁ (for eigenvalue λ₁ = +hbar/2):\nP₁ = |<a₁|alpha>|²\n<a₁|alpha> = [ (1/√2) (<up| + <down|) ] * [ (1/√7) ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) ]\n<a₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) + (1)*(2-i) ]\n<a₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\nP₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428\n\nProbability P₂ (for eigenvalue λ₂ = -hbar/2):\nP₂ = |<a₂|alpha>|²\n<a₂|alpha> = [ (1/√2) (<up| - <down|) ] * [ (1/√7) ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) ]\n<a₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * [ (1)*(1+i) - (1)*(2-i) ]\n<a₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\nP₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**Step 4: Find the average value of the operator**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value <A> can be calculated in two ways.\nMethod 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues\n<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n<A> = (9/14)(+hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)\n<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar/7\n\nMethod 2: Using the definition <A> = <alpha|A|alpha>\n<alpha| = (1/√7) * [ (1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down| ]\nA|alpha> = (hbar/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) [1+i, 2-i]^T = (hbar / (2√7)) [2-i, 1+i]^T\n<A> = <alpha|A|alpha> = (1/√7) [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2√7)) [2-i, 1+i]^T\n<A> = (hbar/7) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]\n<A> = (hbar/7) * [ (2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]\n<A> = (hbar/7) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]\n<A> = (hbar/7) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]\n<A> = (hbar/7) * [2] = 2*hbar/14 = hbar/7\n\nBoth methods yield the same average value: hbar/7.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
