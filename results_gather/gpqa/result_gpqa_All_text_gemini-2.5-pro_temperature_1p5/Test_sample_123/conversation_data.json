    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics\nThe problem deals with the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of undecayed particles `N` from an initial population `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ_lifetime)`.\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` has its internal \"clock\" slowed down from the perspective of a stationary observer (the lab frame). Its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime `τ`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γτ`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Governing Equation\nLet's express the survival fraction `N/N₀` in terms of the given parameters.\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n*   The decay law, when viewed from the lab frame, uses the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) and the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`).\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n*   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-R / (γcτ))`\n    Here, `R` is the detector radius, `γ` is the Lorentz factor, and `cτ` is a constant value for this specific type of particle (its mean decay length in its rest frame).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Scenario\nWe are given the following information for the first scenario:\n*   Detector Radius `R = 30 m`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Survival fraction `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nLet's plug these into our equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown `cτ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)` **(Equation 1)**\n\nThis equation contains all the information from the first scenario. We don't need to calculate the value of `cτ` yet.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Scenario\nNow we want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that results in a different survival fraction.\n*   Required survival fraction `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n*   The radius `R` and the particle property `cτ` remain the same.\n\nThe equation for the second scenario is:\n`2/3 = e^(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)` **(Equation 2)**\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`\nWe now have a system of two equations. A simple way to solve this is to take the ratio of Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\nDivide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nThe `cτ` terms cancel out:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5) * (γ₂ / 30)`\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Value\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is extremely close to 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Time Dilation:** The core of the problem is correctly applying the time dilation formula `τ_lab = γτ` to the lifetime of the particle. The time of flight `t_lab` is measured in the lab frame, so the lifetime must also be expressed in the lab frame for the decay equation to be consistent.\n*   **Constant Properties:** It is essential to recognize that the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (and thus `cτ`) is an intrinsic property and does not change between the two scenarios. The detector radius `R` is also constant. The only variables are the Lorentz factor `γ` and the survival fraction `N/N₀`.\n*   **Logarithm Rules:** Correct application of logarithm rules, such as `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`, is crucial for correctly setting up the final algebraic expression.\n\nBased on the calculation, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
