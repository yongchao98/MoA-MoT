    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements:\n1.  Measuring the observable P and getting the result (eigenvalue) 0.\n2.  Immediately afterward, measuring the observable Q and getting the result (eigenvalue) -1.\n\nThe overall probability is the product of the probability of the first event and the conditional probability of the second event, given the first one occurred.\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Initial state vector (unnormalized): `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n*   Matrix for operator P:\n    ```\n    P = [[0,   1/√2, 0    ],\n         [1/√2, 0,    1/√2 ],\n         [0,   1/√2, 0    ]]\n    ```\n*   Matrix for operator Q:\n    ```\n    Q = [[1,  0,  0 ],\n         [0,  0,  0 ],\n         [0,  0, -1 ]]\n    ```\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step A: Normalize the Initial State**\nThe state vector `|ψ⟩` must be normalized to have a length of 1.\n*   The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   The normalization factor is `1/√6`.\n*   The normalized state vector is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n**Step B: Analyze the First Measurement (P=0)**\nWe need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n*   **Find eigenvalues of P:** The characteristic equation is `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `λ(-λ² + 1) = 0`, which gives eigenvalues `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n*   **Find the eigenvector for λ = 0:** We solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`.\n    ```\n    [[0,   1/√2, 0    ],   [x],   [0]\n     [1/√2, 0,    1/√2 ], * [y] = [0]\n     [0,   1/√2, 0    ]]    [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. Let's choose x=1, giving `[1, 0, -1]`.\n*   **Normalize this eigenvector:**\n    *   The squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n    *   The normalized eigenvector for P=0 is `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step C: Calculate the Probability of the First Measurement**\nThe probability of measuring P and getting 0 is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state `|ψ_norm⟩` onto the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n*   `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) * ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )`\n*   `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n*   `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n*   `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n**Step D: State Collapse**\nAfter measuring P and getting the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step E: Analyze the Second Measurement (Q=-1)**\nNow we measure Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We need the eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1.\n*   **Find eigenvalues of Q:** Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`.\n*   **Find the eigenvector for λ = -1:** The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 for a diagonal matrix is the standard basis vector `[0, 0, 1]^T`.\n*   This eigenvector is already normalized. So, `|q_-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`.\n\n**Step F: Calculate the Probability of the Second Measurement**\nThe probability of measuring Q and getting -1, given the system is in state `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩`, is the square of the magnitude of the projection.\n`Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q_-1|p_0⟩|²`\n*   `⟨q_-1|p_0⟩ = ( [0, 0, 1] ) * ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T )`\n*   `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n*   `= -1/√2`\n*   `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n**Step G: Calculate the Total Probability**\nThe total probability of the sequence of events is the product of the probabilities calculated in Step C and Step F.\n*   `Prob(Total) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n*   `Prob(Total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe final probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
