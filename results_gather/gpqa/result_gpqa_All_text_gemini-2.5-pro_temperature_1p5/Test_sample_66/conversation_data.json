    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total angular momentum, $L_z$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 being $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 being $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Method 1: Conservation of the Z-component of Angular Momentum (Quick Method)**\n    *   The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   Similarly, the corresponding quantum numbers are related by the sum: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    *   In the initial state, the system has a well-defined total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   For this final state, the total magnetic quantum number would be $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   A measurement of the components ($L_{1z}, L_{2z}$) cannot change the total z-component of the system's angular momentum. The initial state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, meaning any measurement result must be consistent with this value.\n    *   Since the initial total magnetic quantum number ($m_{initial} = -1$) is different from the total magnetic quantum number of the desired outcome ($m_{final} = -2$), it is impossible to obtain this outcome.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is 0.\n\n4.  **Method 2: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients (Formal Method)**\n    *   To find the probability, we must express the initial coupled state $|l, m> = |2, -1>$ as a linear combination of the uncoupled basis states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. The probability of measuring the outcome $|-1, -1>$ is the square of the magnitude of its coefficient in this expansion.\n    *   The general expansion is:\n        $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$\n        where the sum is over all $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ such that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$.\n    *   For our case, $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $l=2$, and $m=-1$. We need to find the pairs $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ such that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The possible pairs are:\n        *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (0, -1)$\n        *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (-1, 0)$\n    *   The expansion of the state $|2, -1>$ is therefore:\n        $|2, -1> = <1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1> |1, 0; 1, -1> + <1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1> |1, -1; 1, 0>$\n    *   From a table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling $j_1=1$ and $j_2=1$, we find:\n        *   $<1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n    *   So, the initial state is:\n        $|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, -1; 1, 0>$\n    *   We want to find the probability of measuring the outcome corresponding to the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n    *   The probability is given by the square of the amplitude (inner product):\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | \\psi_{initial}>|^2$\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, -1; 1, 0> \\right) |^2$\n    *   The uncoupled basis states are orthogonal. This means $<m'_{l1}, m'_{l2} | m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = \\delta_{m'_{l1}, m_{l1}} \\delta_{m'_{l2}, m_{l2}}$.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 0; 1, -1> = 0$\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, -1; 1, 0> = 0$\n    *   The inner product is 0, and the probability $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the probability of measuring $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ from the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is zero. This is because the desired outcome is inconsistent with the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
