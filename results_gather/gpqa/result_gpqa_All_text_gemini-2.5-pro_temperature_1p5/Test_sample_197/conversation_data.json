    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all cobalt-containing species in the solution.**\nWhen Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) are present in a solution, a series of complexation equilibria are established. The cobalt-containing species are the free metal ion and the various complexes:\n*   Free Co²⁺ ion\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂] (this is the blue complex we are interested in)\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**Step 2: Use the overall stability constants (β) to relate the concentrations of the species.**\nThe overall stability constants are defined as follows:\n*   β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free thiocyanate ion concentration [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**Step 3: Formulate an expression for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.**\nThe quantity we want to find is the percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex. This is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, c(Co), multiplied by 100. Let's first find the fraction, often denoted as α₂.\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nNow substitute the expressions from Step 1 and Step 2:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻])\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNotice that [Co²⁺] is a common factor in the denominator. We can factor it out and cancel it with the [Co²⁺] in the numerator:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**Careful Point:** The fraction of each species depends only on the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻], not on the total metal concentration c(Co). Therefore, the given c(Co) = 10⁻² M is not needed for this calculation, as long as we know the free [SCN⁻]. The problem states that the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M, which we take to be the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the given numerical values and calculate the result.**\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (often called the complex formation function, Φ):\nΦ = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSo, Φ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Φ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**Step 5: Convert the fraction to a percentage.**\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
