    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Framework: SMEFT**\n    *   SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory.\n    *   It is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. The Lagrangian is written as:\n        `L_SMEFT = L_SM + Σ_d>4 (1/Λ^(d-4)) Σ_i C_i^(d) O_i^(d)`\n    *   Here, `L_SM` is the Standard Model Lagrangian, `O_i^(d)` are operators of mass dimension `d`, `C_i^(d)` are their corresponding Wilson coefficients, and `Λ` is the energy scale of new physics.\n    *   SMEFT is built on a set of core assumptions about the nature of physics at the electroweak scale and below. The question asks which symmetries are part of these core assumptions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Symmetry Option**\n\n    *   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:**\n        *   **Careful Point:** Lorentz symmetry is the symmetry of spacetime under rotations and boosts. It is a cornerstone of Special Relativity and almost all modern Quantum Field Theories (QFTs).\n        *   **Analysis:** SMEFT is formulated as a relativistic QFT. This means that the Lagrangian, and every operator within it, must be constructed to be a Lorentz scalar (invariant under Lorentz transformations). The fields (scalars, fermions, vectors) and derivatives are combined with Lorentz indices properly contracted (e.g., using `g_μν` or `ε_μνρσ`). Violating Lorentz symmetry would require a different framework, often called the \"Standard-Model Extension\" (SME, not SMEFT), which explicitly includes terms that break this symmetry. In SMEFT, Lorentz symmetry is a foundational requirement.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Lorentz symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n    *   **2. Poincare Symmetry:**\n        *   **Careful Point:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime, including Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations.\n        *   **Analysis:** As established, Lorentz symmetry is required. In a local QFT, constructing the action `S = ∫ d^4x L(x)` from a local Lagrangian density `L(x)` automatically ensures translational invariance (up to a total derivative, which does not affect the equations of motion). Since SMEFT is a local QFT respecting Lorentz symmetry, it also respects the full Poincare symmetry.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Poincare symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n    *   **3. CP Symmetry:**\n        *   **Careful Point:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). We need to check if it's a *required* symmetry for the entire theory or if it can be violated by some terms.\n        *   **Analysis:** The Standard Model itself is not CP-symmetric. The weak interaction violates CP symmetry, which is accommodated by a complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, there is no reason to impose CP symmetry on the new operators. In fact, a primary goal of SMEFT is to parameterize potential new sources of CP violation. This is achieved by allowing the Wilson coefficients `C_i` of the higher-dimensional operators to be complex numbers. For instance, operators contributing to particle electric dipole moments are inherently CP-violating and are an important part of SMEFT.\n        *   **Conclusion:** CP symmetry is **not** required to be respected by all operators.\n\n    *   **4. CPT Symmetry:**\n        *   **Careful Point:** CPT symmetry (Charge, Parity, Time Reversal) holds a special status in QFT due to the CPT Theorem.\n        *   **Analysis:** The CPT Theorem is a fundamental result stating that any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian will be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is, by construction, a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, the CPT theorem applies. All terms in the Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators `O_i`, must be built in a way that respects CPT invariance.\n        *   **Conclusion:** CPT symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n3.  **Final Synthesis and Answer Selection**\n\n    *   Symmetries that **must** be respected: Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4).\n    *   Symmetries that **are not required** to be respected: CP (3).\n    *   Now, we check the given options:\n        *   A) 1,2,4 - This option includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. This matches our findings.\n        *   B) 1,2 - This is incomplete as it omits the fundamental CPT symmetry.\n        *   C) 1,3,4 - This is incorrect because it includes CP symmetry, which can be violated.\n        *   D) 3,4 - This is incorrect as it omits Lorentz and Poincare symmetries and includes CP symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of symmetries that all operators in the SMEFT must respect are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.\n\n<<<A>>>"
