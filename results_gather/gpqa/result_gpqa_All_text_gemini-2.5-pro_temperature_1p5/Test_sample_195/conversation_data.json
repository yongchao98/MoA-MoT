    "This problem requires the application of the principle of conservation of energy in the context of special relativity. We will analyze the energy of the mass at two specific points in its oscillation: at the maximum amplitude and at the equilibrium position.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the Total Energy of the System:**\n    In a relativistic system, the total energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This total energy includes the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    For the harmonic oscillator, we also have potential energy stored in the spring. Since the problem states the oscillator obeys Hooke's law ($F=-kx$), the potential energy at a displacement $x$ from equilibrium is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    The total conserved energy of the mass-spring system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the spring's potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A):**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the amplitude $A$, the mass momentarily stops before changing direction.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Speed: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: Since $v=0$, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   Potential energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1) \\cdot mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Energy at the Equilibrium Position (x = 0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, so the potential energy is zero. At this point, the mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Speed: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   Potential energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The total energy of the system at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy of the system must be the same at all points in the oscillation. Therefore, the total energy at $x=A$ must equal the total energy at $x=0$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Maximum Speed $v_{max}$:**\n    First, we solve the energy conservation equation for the maximum Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$ into this equation:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is $c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$. This exactly matches option C.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical:** The key distinction is using relativistic energy ($\\gamma mc^2$) instead of classical kinetic energy ($\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$). Option B, $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, is the classical result derived from $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n*   **Potential Energy Source:** The potential energy $U=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ comes from Hooke's Law, as stated in the problem.\n*   **Conserved Quantity:** The conserved quantity is the sum of the particle's total relativistic energy and the external potential energy: $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n*   **States for Comparison:** Choosing the points of maximum displacement ($v=0$, $U=max$) and equilibrium ($v=max$, $U=0$) simplifies the energy conservation equation significantly.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy:** The steps to isolate $\\gamma_{max}$ and then solve for $v_{max}$ must be performed carefully.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads directly to the expression in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
