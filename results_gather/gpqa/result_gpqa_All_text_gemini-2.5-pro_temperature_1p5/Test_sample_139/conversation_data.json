    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance X and its properties.**\n*   \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\": This suggests the use of isotopes like Deuterium (D or ²H) or Tritium (³H), which are common in organic chemistry for mechanistic studies and specific reductions.\n*   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\": This points towards a common reagent class. Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) fit this description. Their \"close analogs\" incorporating a heavier isotope would be Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n*   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\": A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Both functional groups are reduced by strong reducing agents like LiAlH₄. The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The resulting molecule is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This strongly supports X being a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄. NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction of X with Y.**\n*   \"X... reacts violently with liquid Y\": LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water and other protic solvents. This supports the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n*   \"with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\": Let's analyze potential small gas molecules (W) where the number of protons (p⁺) equals the number of neutrons (n⁰). We use the most common isotopes unless specified.\n    *   H₂: 2 p⁺, 0 n⁰\n    *   He: 2 p⁺, 2 n⁰ (Inert, unlikely product of a violent reaction)\n    *   **D₂ (²H₂)**: 2 p⁺, 2 n⁰. This fits perfectly and is consistent with X containing Deuterium.\n    *   ¹⁴N₂: 14 p⁺, 14 n⁰. Plausible, but less connected to the other clues.\n    *   ¹²C¹⁶O: 14 p⁺, 14 n⁰. Plausible, but less connected.\n    *   CD₄: 10 p⁺, 10 n⁰. Plausible, but formation from a keto acid reaction isn't direct.\n    Given that X contains deuterium, the most likely gas W is D₂. For LiAlD₄ to produce D₂ gas, it must react with a source of deuterium. The most common liquid that is a source of deuterium is heavy water, D₂O.\n*   So, we can deduce: **X = LiAlD₄** and **Y = D₂O**.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent, releases D₂ gas (W), and involves the deuterated reagent X.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the precipitate G and substance B.**\n*   \"a precipitate G forms\": In the reaction above, Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is insoluble and will form a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n*   \"which, when heated, releases B\": Hydroxides and deuteroxides decompose upon heating to form an oxide and water.\n    *   Decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   The substance released (B) is heavy water, D₂O. So, **B = D₂O**.\n*   \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K\": The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). 276.97 K is indeed very close to 277 K. This confirms all our deductions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Substance X has been identified as **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n*   The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum (Al). The stable isotope is ²⁷Al.\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements found in the formula unit.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen isotopes**: There are four atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass of one D atom is approximately 2 amu.\n      Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of Aluminum isotopes**: There is one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass of one ²⁷Al atom is 27 amu.\n      Total mass from Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n*   **Cumulative (total) sum**:\n    Sum = (Total mass from Hydrogen) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
