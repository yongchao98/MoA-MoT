    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha line:** This is a specific spectral absorption (or emission) line of neutral hydrogen. It occurs when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions between the first excited state (n=2) and the ground state (n=1). The wavelength of this transition in the atom's own reference frame (the \"rest wavelength\") is $\\lambda_0 \\approx 1216$ Angstroms (Å). Note that 1 Angstrom = $10^{-10}$ meters.\n*   **Redshift (z):** Due to the expansion of the universe, light from distant objects gets \"stretched\" to longer wavelengths. This phenomenon is called redshift. The redshift `z` is defined by the formula:\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs} - \\lambda_0}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $\\lambda_{obs}$ is the wavelength we observe on Earth and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. This can be rearranged to find the observed wavelength:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0 (1 + z)$\n*   **Optical Ground-Based Telescopes:** These are telescopes located on the surface of the Earth that detect light in the \"optical\" part of the electromagnetic spectrum. A crucial limitation is the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main constraint**\n\nThe question states the objects must be detectable with **optical ground-based telescopes**. The Earth's atmosphere, particularly the ozone layer, absorbs most of the high-energy radiation from space, including a significant portion of the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum.\n*   The Lyman-alpha line, at a rest wavelength of 1216 Å, is deep in the UV part of the spectrum.\n*   Light with wavelengths shorter than about 3500 Å is largely blocked by the atmosphere and cannot reach ground-based telescopes. This threshold wavelength is known as the \"atmospheric cutoff\". The exact value varies with altitude and atmospheric conditions, but a value between 3200 Å and 4000 Å is a standard estimate for the beginning of the optical window accessible from the ground. For this problem, we need to find the redshift required to shift the 1216 Å line past this atmospheric barrier.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the problem mathematically**\n\nWe want to find the *lower limit* on the redshift `z`. This means we need to find the smallest `z` for which the Lyman-alpha line becomes detectable. This occurs when the redshift is just large enough to shift the Lyman-alpha line from its rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å) to the minimum observable wavelength from the ground ($\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{cutoff}$).\n\nSo, we set:\n*   $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å\n*   $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{cutoff} \\approx 3500$ Å (This is a reasonable estimate for the atmospheric cutoff).\n\nWe need to solve for `z` in the redshift equation:\n$z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the redshift**\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n$z = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}} - 1$\n$z \\approx 2.878 - 1$\n$z \\approx 1.878$\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result with the given options**\n\nThe calculated redshift is $z \\approx 1.88$. Let's examine the options:\nA) 3\nB) 1.9\nC) 2.4\nD) 1.2\n\nOur calculated value is extremely close to option B) 1.9.\n\n**Careful Points & Verification:**\n\n*   **Why not other options?** Let's check what observed wavelength corresponds to the other redshift values.\n    *   **If z = 1.2 (Option D):** $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.2) = 1216 \\times 2.2 = 2675.2$ Å. This is still deep in the UV and would be completely absorbed by the atmosphere. Thus, it's not detectable.\n    *   **If z = 2.4 (Option C):** $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 2.4) = 1216 \\times 3.4 = 4134.4$ Å. This is well into the violet/blue part of the visible spectrum and would be easily detectable. However, the question asks for the *lower limit*. Since objects with a redshift of 1.9 are already detectable, 2.4 cannot be the lower limit.\n    *   **If z = 3 (Option A):** $\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\times (1 + 3) = 1216 \\times 4 = 4864$ Å. This is also easily detectable and is not the lower limit.\n*   **The Atmospheric Cutoff Value:** The choice of $\\lambda_{cutoff} \\approx 3500$ Å is an estimate. Using the answer z = 1.9, we can calculate the implied cutoff wavelength: $\\lambda_{cutoff} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4$ Å. This is a very standard and physically reasonable value for the atmospheric cutoff, confirming that z = 1.9 is the intended answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted from its rest wavelength of 1216 Å to a wavelength that can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, which is approximately 3500 Å. The minimum redshift required to achieve this is calculated as $z = (\\lambda_{obs}/\\lambda_0) - 1$. Using $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx 3500$ Å, the redshift is $z \\approx 1.9$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
