    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound X from its spectral data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This is a very downfield, broad singlet. This chemical shift and appearance are definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-CO**H**).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH), while the more upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis (0.9 ppm to 2.9 ppm):** Let's piece together the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us an ethyl fragment starter: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our ethyl fragment. It is coupled to the methyl group (3H) and another group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H is the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift suggests it is benzylic (attached directly to the aromatic ring).\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have a benzylic CH group. Attached to it are a methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm doublet) and an ethyl group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and 1.7 ppm multiplet).\n        *   `Aryl-CH-(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`\n        *   This structure is a **sec-butyl** group. Let's check if the couplings match. The benzylic CH is adjacent to 3 protons on the methyl and 2 protons on the methylene, so it would be a complex multiplet (correct). The CH₂ is adjacent to the CH and the CH₃, so it would be a complex multiplet (correct).\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR and IR:** Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D), which is the starting material.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a variety of functional groups to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Specific Reaction:** Most importantly for this problem, red P / HI is one of the few reagents that can reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 of the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged. The resulting molecule is a benzene ring with a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.\n*   **Final Product Name:** **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. This involves partial reduction and rearrangement.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - Correct. This is the product obtained by the complete reduction of the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. This would require an unlikely skeletal rearrangement from sec-butyl to isobutyl.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, compound X.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
