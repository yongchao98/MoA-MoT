    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Question Analysis\nThe goal is to determine the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X, in the laboratory frame. We are given the following information:\n*   The total energy of the particle in the lab frame, $E_{X} = 8$ GeV.\n*   The rest mass of the particle, $m_{X} = 1.2$ GeV (or more precisely, the rest energy is $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2$ GeV).\n*   The decay width of the particle, $\\Gamma_{X} = 320$ MeV.\n\nThe mean decay distance is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. This requires us to consider concepts from both particle physics and special relativity.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Rest Frame vs. Lab Frame:** The decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) is an intrinsic property of the particle and is related to its lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau_0$). However, the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the lab, so its lifetime will be longer due to time dilation. We must calculate the lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) to find the decay distance in the lab.\n2.  **Units:** All units must be consistent throughout the calculation. The energy and mass are given in GeV, while the width is in MeV. It is best to convert everything to a single unit of energy (e.g., MeV or GeV).\n3.  **Constants:** We will need the values of the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) and the speed of light ($c$). It is often convenient to use the combined constant $\\hbar c$, which has units of energy times length (e.g., MeV·fm).\n4.  **Relativistic Formulas:** We must use the correct relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, time dilation, and velocity. The mean decay distance, $d$, is given by $d = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's speed and $\\tau$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame ($\\tau_0$).**\nThe decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) and the rest frame mean lifetime ($\\tau_0$) are related by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, with the exact relation being:\n$\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\nWe need the value of $\\hbar$. It's often easier to work with the product $\\hbar c$.\nLet's first calculate the \"rest frame decay length\", which is $c\\tau_0$.\n$c\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\nWe use the known value $\\hbar c \\approx 197.3$ MeV·fm, where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m.\nFirst, ensure consistent units.\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV.\n$c\\tau_0 = \\frac{197.3 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 0.6166$ fm.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the relativistic factor, $\\gamma \\beta$.**\nThe mean decay distance in the lab frame, $d$, is related to the rest frame decay length, $c\\tau_0$, by:\n$d = \\gamma \\beta (c\\tau_0)$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $\\beta = v/c$. The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass.\nFrom relativistic kinematics, we have:\n*   Total energy: $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$\n*   Momentum: $p c = \\gamma \\beta m_X c^2$\nThe relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom this, we can find the momentum:\n$pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\nAnd we can express $\\gamma \\beta$ as the ratio of momentum to mass-energy:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\nLet's plug in the given values (first converting them to the same unit, MeV):\n*   $E_X = 8$ GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV = 1200 MeV\n\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8000 \\, \\text{MeV})^2 - (1200 \\, \\text{MeV})^2}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000}}{1200} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200}$\n$\\gamma \\beta \\approx \\frac{7909.5}{1200} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance ($d$).**\nNow we can combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2.\n$d = (\\gamma \\beta) \\cdot (c\\tau_0)$\n$d \\approx (6.5912) \\cdot (0.6166 \\, \\text{fm})$\n$d \\approx 4.064 \\, \\text{fm}$\n\nSince 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m, the mean decay distance is:\n$d \\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\n**Final Check with Higher Precision:**\nUsing more precise values for constants:\n*   $\\hbar c = 1.97327 \\times 10^{-13}$ MeV·m\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320$ MeV\n*   $E_X = 8000$ MeV\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1200$ MeV\n\nThe mean decay length formula is $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\times \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n$d = \\frac{\\sqrt{8000^2 - 1200^2}}{1200} \\times \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n$d = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200} \\times (6.16647 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m})$\n$d = (6.59124) \\times (6.16647 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m})$\n$d \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\nThis calculated value matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
