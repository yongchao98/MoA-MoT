    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Decode the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, we need to translate the chemical description into a 2D structure.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n2.  **Principal Functional Group:** We have several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent name is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n3.  **Placing the Main Groups:** The problem states that the carboxylic acid (C1), carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all \"meta to one another\". This means they must be in a 1, 3, 5 relationship on the ring. We can temporarily place the carbaldehyde at C3 and the cyano group at C5.\n4.  **Placing Other Substituents Relative to C1:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": This places the -OH and -N(CH3)2 groups at C2 and C6. We don't yet know which is which.\n    *   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": This places the -OCH3 group at C4.\n5.  **Using the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguity:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" The nitrile (-CN) is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   We already placed the methoxy group (-OCH3) at C4, which is consistent with it being ortho to C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must therefore be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   Since the -OH group is at C6, the dimethylamino group [-N(CH3)2] must be at the remaining ortho position, C2.\n\nLet's summarize the positions based on this deduction.\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n\nThe structure is fully defined. Note that if we had initially placed the cyano group at C3 and the carbaldehyde at C5, we would get the mirror image of this structure. The IUPAC naming rules will result in the same name for both enantiomers.\n\n### Step 2: Number the Benzene Ring\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, the numbering must give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (position numbers).\n\n1.  The carbon of the principal functional group (-COOH) is always C1.\n2.  We can number the ring clockwise or counter-clockwise. In this fully substituted ring, both directions give the same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  When there is a tie in locant sets, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituent names to break the tie. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that appears first in alphabetical order.\n\n### Step 3: Alphabetize Substituents and Apply the Tie-Breaker\n\n1.  **List and name the substituents:**\n    *   -CN: cyano\n    *   -N(CH3)2: dimethylamino (The 'd' is included for alphabetization)\n    *   -CHO: formyl\n    *   -OH: hydroxy\n    *   -OCH3: methoxy\n2.  **Alphabetize the list:**\n    1.  **C**yano\n    2.  **D**imethylamino\n    3.  **F**ormyl\n    4.  **H**ydroxy\n    5.  **M**ethoxy\n3.  **Compare numbering schemes:**\n    *   **Scheme A (Clockwise, based on our drawing):**\n        *   2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n    *   **Scheme B (Counter-clockwise):**\n        *   2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n4.  **Apply the rule:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". In Scheme A, it gets locant 5. In Scheme B, it gets locant 3. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scheme B is the correct numbering scheme.**\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Final IUPAC Name\n\nUsing the correct numbering (Scheme B) and arranging the substituents alphabetically:\n\n*   **Cyano** is at position **3**.\n*   **Dimethylamino** is at position **6**.\n*   **Formyl** is at position **5**.\n*   **Hydroxy** is at position **2**.\n*   **Methoxy** is at position **4**.\n\nCombine these alphabetically before the parent name \"benzoic acid\":\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Provided Options\n\n*   A) `5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid` - Incorrect numbering.\n*   B) `3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid` - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   C) `2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid` - Incorrect numbering and substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n*   D) `2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid` - Correct numbering, but substituents are not listed alphabetically.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
