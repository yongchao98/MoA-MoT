    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism**\n\n**1. Understanding Tautomerism:**\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, called tautomers, readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen, and the carbon it is attached to is the alpha-carbon, which is typically sp³-hybridized.\n\n**2. Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n*   **Structure:** Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds. Its formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** Each of these alpha-carbons is part of a double bond (sp²-hybridized). They do have hydrogen atoms attached, but these are vinylic hydrogens, not hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone lacks the required sp³-hybridized alpha-carbon with an alpha-hydrogen. Therefore, it cannot undergo the typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n**3. Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n*   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons between the carbonyls (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n*   **Alpha-Carbons:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all alpha-carbons to two carbonyl groups each. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to both the C1 carbonyl and the C3 carbonyl.\n*   **Check for Alpha-Hydrogens:** These alpha-carbons are sp³-hybridized and each has two hydrogens. These hydrogens are quite acidic because the negative charge that results from removing one is stabilized by two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has acidic alpha-hydrogens and readily undergoes tautomerism. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and very stable compound. This provides a strong driving force for tautomerization.\n\n**Outcome for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism**\n\n**1. Understanding Optical Isomerism:**\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n**2. Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (Hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (Methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (Methoxycarbonyl group)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry, so it is chiral. Chiral molecules exist as pairs of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and are optically active. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a center of inversion (located at the midpoint of the C=C bond).\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule, it is optically inactive and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Outcome for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these two findings, we match them with the given options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
