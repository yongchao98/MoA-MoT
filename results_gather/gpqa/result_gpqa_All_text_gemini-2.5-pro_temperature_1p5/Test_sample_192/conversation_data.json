    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Given Information:** The number of stars (let's call it `N`) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`.\n    *   This can be written as the proportionality: `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n*   **Question:** How does the number of stars change with distance `r`, specifically per unit range of distance?\n    *   This is asking for the relationship for `dN/dr`, the number of stars in a small shell of distance between `r` and `r+dr`.\n\n**2. List the Careful Points**\n\n*   **Parallax-Distance Relationship:** The most crucial point is the fundamental relationship between parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`). They are inversely proportional.\n    *   `plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`.\n*   **Interpreting \"Number of Stars\":** The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\n    1.  The **density** of stars per unit of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) follows this relation.\n    2.  The **cumulative number** of stars with parallax *greater than* `plx` follows this relation. This is a common way star counts are presented in astronomy (e.g., number of stars brighter than a certain magnitude). A larger parallax means a smaller distance, so counting stars with parallax greater than `plx` is equivalent to counting all stars *closer than* a certain distance `r`. This interpretation is the most standard for this type of problem. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Given Information Mathematically**\n    Based on our interpretation (Careful Point #2), the cumulative number of stars with parallax `p` greater than a value `plx`, let's call it `N(>plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n*   **Step 2: Convert from Parallax to Distance**\n    We need to find the number of stars as a function of distance `r`. We use the inverse relationship `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n    Counting all stars with parallax greater than `plx` (`p > plx`) is the same as counting all stars with distance less than `r` (`d < r`), where `r` corresponds to `plx`.\n    So, the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r`, let's call it `N(<r)`, is equivalent to `N(>plx)`.\n    We can substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into our equation from Step 1.\n    *   `N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    *   `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\n*   **Step 3: Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance**\n    The question asks for the number of stars \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN(<r)/dr`.\n    *   We have `N(<r) = k * r^5` for some constant of proportionality `k`.\n    *   We differentiate this expression with respect to `r`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx (x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`):\n        `dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n        `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Final Proportionality**\n    From the result of the differentiation, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is directly proportional to the fourth power of the distance.\n    *   `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance changes as `r^4`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
