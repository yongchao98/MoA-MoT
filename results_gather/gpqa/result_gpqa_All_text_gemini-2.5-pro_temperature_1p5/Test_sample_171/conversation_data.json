    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics Principle**\nThe problem describes the excitation of atoms in the photospheres of stars. The key information is that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This assumption allows us to use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels in a system at a given temperature. The Boltzmann equation is:\n$$ \\frac{N_j}{N_i} = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\nwhere:\n*   $N_j/N_i$ is the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy state (j) to the lower energy state (i). This ratio represents the degree of excitation.\n*   $g_j/g_i$ is the ratio of the statistical weights of the energy levels, which is a constant for a given atomic transition.\n*   $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels ($E_j - E_i$).\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n*   $T$ is the temperature of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Principle to Both Stars**\nLet's define the excitation ratio for each star.\n*   For star_1 with temperature $T_1$, the excitation ratio is:\n    $R_1 = \\left(\\frac{N_j}{N_i}\\right)_1 = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}$\n*   For star_2 with temperature $T_2$, the excitation ratio is:\n    $R_2 = \\left(\\frac{N_j}{N_i}\\right)_2 = \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}$\n\n**Step 3: Use the Relationship Given in the Problem**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited ... when compared to ... star_2\". This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n$R_1 = 2 \\times R_2$\n\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 2 into this relationship:\n$$ \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{g_j}{g_i} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} \\right) $$\n\nThe constant term $\\frac{g_j}{g_i}$ appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n$$ e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}} $$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the Relationship between Temperatures**\nTo solve for the temperatures, which are in the exponents, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(2 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}\\right) $$\n\nUsing the logarithm properties ($\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(e^x) = x$):\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) + \\ln\\left(e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2}}\\right) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} $$\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate the $\\ln(2)$ term:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{kT_1} = \\ln(2) $$\n\nFactor out the common term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n\nCombine the fractions inside the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\n\n**Step 5: Use the Given Numerical Values (A Careful Point)**\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   Energy difference: $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J\n*   Boltzmann constant: $k \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K\n\nLet's calculate the pre-factor $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\approx \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} \\approx 1 \\text{ K} $$\nThis is a crucial point. The energy value was chosen specifically to make this factor equal to 1 (with units of Kelvin).\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\n$$ (1 \\text{ K}) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $$\nThe term $\\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right)$ has units of 1/K, so the left side is dimensionless, matching the right side.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $$\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Options**\nLet's check the given options:\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)] - Incorrect sign in the numerator.\nB) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] - Incorrect form.\nC) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] - Incorrect, denominator is squared.\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)] - This exactly matches our derived equation.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n1.  The assumption of LTE is essential for using the Boltzmann equation.\n2.  The phrase \"twice as excited\" refers to the ratio of population densities, meaning $R_1 = 2 R_2$. This implies that star_1 is hotter than star_2 ($T_1 > T_2$), which is consistent with the final positive result for $\\ln(2)$.\n3.  The specific numerical values for $\\Delta E$ and $k$ are not just for context; they are critical for simplifying the pre-factor $\\Delta E / k$ to approximately 1 K.\n4.  The final derived equation has the correct algebraic form matching option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
