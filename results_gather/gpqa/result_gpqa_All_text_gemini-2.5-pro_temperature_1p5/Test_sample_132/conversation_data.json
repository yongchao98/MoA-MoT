    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\nThe solution contains:\n*   KH₂PO₄: A salt that completely dissociates in water to provide potassium ions (K⁺) and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H₂PO₄⁻). H₂PO₄⁻ is a weak acid.\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: A hydrated salt that completely dissociates in water to provide sodium ions (Na⁺) and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻). HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\nThe combination of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) forms a buffer solution.\nThe question asks for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n*   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L.\n\n*   **For KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Since KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻, moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = moles / V = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n\n*   **For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Since Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O, moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = moles / V = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer solution.**\nThe pH and [H⁺] of this buffer are determined by the equilibrium between the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. This corresponds to the second dissociation step of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄).\n\n*   Equilibrium reaction: H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n*   The expression for Ka₂ is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can solve for [H⁺] by rearranging the equation. We use the initial concentrations of the buffer components as they will not change significantly.\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻].**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid.\n\n*   Equilibrium reaction: HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n*   The expression for Ka₃ is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for [PO₄³⁻] using the [H⁺] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]. The change in [HPO₄²⁻] and [H⁺] from this third dissociation is negligible because Ka₃ is very small.\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated concentration [PO₄³⁻] is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **Correct Molar Masses:** Ensure you use the correct molar mass for the hydrated salt (Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O).\n2.  **Correct Ka value:** The primary buffer equilibrium is governed by Ka₂, not Ka₁ or Ka₃. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the solution.\n3.  **Final Calculation:** The final calculation for the target ion, [PO₄³⁻], depends on its parent species (HPO₄²⁻) and its corresponding equilibrium constant (Ka₃).\n4.  **Approximations:** It is valid to assume that the initial concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their equilibrium concentrations when calculating [H⁺], because the acid/base is weak. Similarly, it's valid to use the calculated [H⁺] and initial [HPO₄²⁻] to find [PO₄³⁻] because Ka₃ is extremely small.\n5.  **Volume Unit:** Ensure volume is converted from cm³ to L (1 cm³ = 1 mL = 0.001 L).\n\nFinal calculation: [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸) = 6.235... x 10⁻⁷ M. Rounding to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
