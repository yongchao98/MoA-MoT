    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed between them (`v_rel`).\nb) The total energy of the system (`E`).\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1: `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1: `v1 = 0.6c` (in the +x direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2: `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2: `v2 = 0.5c` (in the +x direction)\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n---\n\n### **Part A: Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n**Careful Point 1:** At relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract the velocities (`0.6c - 0.5c`). We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n\n**Step A1: Identify the correct formula.**\nThe relative velocity `v_rel` of an object with velocity `v2` as seen from the reference frame of an object moving with velocity `v1` (both in the same direction) is given by:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n(Note: `(v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c^2)` would give the velocity of astronaut 1 as seen by astronaut 2. The magnitude will be the same, only the sign will be opposite).\n\n**Step A2: Substitute the given values into the formula.**\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n\n**Step A3: Simplify the expression.**\n*   Numerator: `0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`\n*   Denominator: `1 - (0.30 * c^2) / c^2 = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70`\n\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.70`\n\n**Step A4: Calculate the final value.**\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857 c`\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is `v_rel = 0.14c`.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Calculating the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the astronauts, as measured in a single inertial frame (the lab frame).\n**Careful Point 3:** The total energy of a single particle is not its rest energy (`m₀c²`) but `E = γ * m₀ * c²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Step B1: State the formula for total energy.**\nThe total energy of the system is `E = E1 + E2`.\nThe energy for each astronaut is `E_i = γ_i * m_i * c^2`, where `γ_i = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_i^2 / c^2)`.\n\n**Step B2: Calculate the energy of the first astronaut (E1).**\n*   `m1 = 2m`\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor, `γ1`:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Step B3: Calculate the energy of the second astronaut (E2).**\n*   `m2 = 3m`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   First, calculate its Lorentz factor, `γ2`:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Step B4: Calculate the total energy of the system (E).**\n*   `E = E1 + E2`\n*   `E = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²`\n*   `E = 5.964 mc²`\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is `E = 5.96 mc²`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The calculated relative speed is `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n*   The calculated total energy is `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc² (Incorrect)\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc² (Incorrect)\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc² (Incorrect)\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc² (Correct)\n\nThe final answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
