    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe core of the problem is to equate two different physical phenomena that produce a similar observational signal—a periodic dimming of a star's light.\n*   **Phenomenon 1:** Rotational modulation due to a hemisphere covered in dark starspots. The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing its unspotted hemisphere and then its spotty hemisphere.\n*   **Phenomenon 2:** A transiting exoplanet, which periodically blocks a fraction of the star's light.\n\nWe need to find the size of an exoplanet (relative to its star) that would cause a dimming of the same magnitude as the starspots.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starspot Scenario**\n\n*   **Key Concept:** The amount of light (flux, F) emitted per unit area by a star is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that Flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (F ∝ T⁴).\n*   **Maximum Brightness (B_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature T_eff. The brightness is proportional to the total flux from this projected disk.\n    *   B_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴ , where A_disk is the area of the star's projected disk (πR_star²).\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (B_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` of its area covered by cooler spots. We assume this filling factor applies to the projected disk as well.\n    *   Fraction of the disk that is normal photosphere = (1 - f)\n    *   Fraction of the disk covered by spots = f\n    *   The brightness is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool parts.\n    *   B_min ∝ [(1 - f) * A_disk * T_eff⁴] + [f * A_disk * T_spot⁴]\n\n*   **Calculate the Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the signal is the fractional change in brightness between the maximum and minimum states.\n    *   Amplitude_spot = (B_max - B_min) / B_max\n    *   Substituting the proportionalities (A_disk and other constants will cancel out):\n    *   Amplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f)T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n    *   Amplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\n    *   Amplitude_spot = [f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n    *   Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n**3. Analyze the Exoplanet Transit Scenario**\n\n*   **Key Concept:** When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its projected area to the star's projected area. This is known as the transit depth.\n*   **Area of the star's disk:** A_star = πR_star²\n*   **Area of the planet's disk:** A_pl = πR_pl²\n*   **Amplitude of Signal (Transit Depth):**\n    *   Amplitude_planet = (Light Blocked) / (Total Light) = A_pl / A_star\n    *   Amplitude_planet = (πR_pl²) / (πR_star²)\n    *   Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nNow, we set the amplitude from the spots equal to the amplitude from the planet and solve for the desired ratio, R_pl / R_star.\n\n*   Amplitude_spot = Amplitude_planet\n*   f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo solve for the ratio R_pl / R_star, we take the square root of both sides:\n\n*   R_pl / R_star = √{ f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] }\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Temperatures:** Ensure temperatures are in Kelvin. T_eff = 6000 K, and T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n*   **Filling Factor:** The filling factor `f` is given as 20%, which must be converted to its decimal form, f = 0.20.\n*   **Assumptions:** We are assuming the star and spots are perfect blackbodies. We are also assuming that the filling factor on the hemisphere's surface is equivalent to the filling factor on the projected disk, which is a standard simplification. For the planet, we assume a simple transit model without limb darkening.\n*   **The Power of 4:** Be careful to raise the temperature ratio to the fourth power, as per the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   **Final Step:** Remember to take the square root to find the radius ratio, not the area ratio.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\n1.  Calculate the temperature ratio:\n    *   T_spot / T_eff = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6\n\n2.  Raise the ratio to the fourth power:\n    *   (5/6)⁴ = (5*5*5*5) / (6*6*6*6) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.48225\n\n3.  Calculate the term in the square brackets:\n    *   1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ≈ 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775\n\n4.  Multiply by the filling factor `f`:\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355\n\n5.  Take the square root to find the final ratio:\n    *   R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
