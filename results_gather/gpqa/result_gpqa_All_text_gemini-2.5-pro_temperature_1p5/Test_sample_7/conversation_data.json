    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the genetic experiment to determine the interaction between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the role of each gene based on single-mutant phenotypes.\n\nThe wild-type (control) plant has 100% resistance. The phenotypes of the single knock-out mutants tell us about the contribution of each individual gene.\n\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function leads to a 25% reduction in resistance (100% - 75% = 25%). This indicates G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function leads to a complete loss of resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function leads to a 50% reduction in resistance (100% - 50% = 50%). This indicates G3 also contributes significantly to resistance.\n\n**Initial Conclusion:** G2 is the most critical gene for resistance. G1 and G3 also play roles, with G3 having a larger effect on resistance than G1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the double-mutants to determine gene hierarchy (Epistasis).\n\nEpistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene mutation masks the phenotype of another. In a pathway, we analyze the double mutant's phenotype and compare it to the single mutants' phenotypes.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%.\n    *   Phenotype of g1: 75%\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0%\n    *   The phenotype of the `g1g2` double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation is epistatic to the `g1` mutation.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%.\n    *   Phenotype of g2: 0%\n    *   Phenotype of g3: 50%\n    *   The phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant (0%) is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation is also epistatic to the `g3` mutation.\n\n**Conclusion from Epistasis:** The G2 gene's function is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n\n### Step 3: Integrate the epistasis results with the knowledge of a transcription factor.\n\nThe problem states that \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\".\n\n*   In a regulatory pathway (e.g., TF activates a target gene), a mutation in the **upstream gene** is epistatic to a mutation in the downstream gene. For example, if a TF is knocked out, its target gene won't be activated, so it doesn't matter if the target gene itself is functional or mutated—the pathway is blocked at the start.\n*   Since the `g2` mutation is epistatic to `g1` and `g3`, and we know there's an upstream TF, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is the upstream transcription factor** that controls the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n**Pathway Model:** G2 (TF) → activates G1 and G3.\n*   If G2 is knocked out (`g2` mutant), neither G1 nor G3 can function, leading to a total loss of resistance (0%). This matches the data.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3.\n\nNow let's examine the G1 and G3 interaction, knowing they are both downstream of G2.\n\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. (G3 is still active).\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. (G1 is still active).\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n\nThe fact that the `g1g3` double mutant has a phenotype that is much more severe (10% resistance) than either single mutant (75% and 50%) indicates that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. They both contribute to the final resistance phenotype, and one can partially compensate for the loss of the other. This relationship is called **gene redundancy**.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the given options.\n\nLet's review the options based on our conclusions:\n1.  **G2 is a transcription factor.** (Correct)\n2.  **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.** (Correct)\n3.  The relationship between G1 and G3 is not a simple masking epistasis, but a synergistic interaction characteristic of gene redundancy. However, we must select the best overall option.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** \"Same promoter\" is a plausible mechanism but \"gene redundancy\" is the functional conclusion from the data. The epistasis claim is questionable.\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is incorrect.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** \"Pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded from this experiment.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the TF and correctly describes the G1-G3 interaction as gene redundancy. While the specific claim of \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is not supported by a standard definition of epistasis (as a novel phenotype appears), the first two statements in this option are strongly supported by the data, making it the best choice among the alternatives. The other options contain clear factual errors based on the data provided (e.g., identifying the wrong TF or the wrong type of gene interaction).\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The experimental data strongly supports that G2 is an upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 are partially redundant genes downstream of G2. Option D is the only one that captures these key findings.\n\n<<<D>>>"
