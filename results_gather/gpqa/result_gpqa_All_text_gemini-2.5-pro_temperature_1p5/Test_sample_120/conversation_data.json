    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" describes this framework.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations at the chiral centers are given: C1 is R, C3 is R, C4 is R, and C6 is S. We can visualize this with the epoxide ring situated on the \"top\" (beta or wedged) face of the cyclohexane ring. The specific configurations of the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are determined by the given R/S assignments. For this analysis, it is sufficient to know their configurations without drawing the exact conformation, as we will rely on the rules of the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\nThe reagent is Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), also known as a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Nucleophile:** This reagent is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction with Epoxides:** Organocuprates react with epoxides in an SN2-type nucleophilic substitution reaction to open the epoxide ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\nThe question states a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6, and the oxygen atom.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group in addition to being part of the bicyclic ring system. It is a tertiary carbon center (within the hydrocarbon skeleton) and quaternary overall.\n    *   C6 is substituted only with a hydrogen atom (and is part of the ring system). It is a secondary carbon center (within the hydrocarbon skeleton) and tertiary overall.\n*   **Conclusion:** C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) will attack C6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\nThe question provides another key rule: \"In the disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\"\n*   This is a characteristic feature of an SN2 reaction. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (which is the epoxide oxygen).\n*   The attack occurs at C6. The original configuration at C6 is (S).\n*   Due to the SN2 mechanism, the configuration at C6 will be inverted. So, the new configuration at this carbon in the product will be (R).\n*   The bonds at the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not broken during this reaction. Therefore, their configurations are retained.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Product Structure and Name**\n*   **Reaction Summary:**\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6, causing inversion from S to R.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide becomes a C1-OH bond after acidic or aqueous workup.\n    *   The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 remain R.\n*   **Resulting Configurations:**\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C1: Configuration remains **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C6: Configuration inverts from S to **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C3: Configuration remains **R**.\n    *   At the carbon atom from original C4: Configuration remains **R**.\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group is assigned as C1 for IUPAC naming. This corresponds to the *original* C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The substituents are now four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group. The methyl groups are on the carbons corresponding to original C1, original C3, original C4, and a new one on original C6.\n    *   To assign the lowest possible locants to the methyl groups, we number the ring starting from the C-OH carbon. We have two choices: clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n        *   If we number clockwise: Methyls would be at 1, original C2 (no Me), original C3, original C4, original C5 (no Me), original C6. Locants: 1, 3, 4, 6.\n        *   If we number counter-clockwise: Methyls would be at 1, original C6, original C5 (no Me), original C4, original C3. Locants: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n    *   The set (1, 2, 4, 5) is lower than (1, 3, 4, 6). Thus, the correct IUPAC numbering is counter-clockwise.\n    *   The product is named **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **Assigning Stereochemistry to the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   New C1 (was original C1): Configuration is **R**. -> (1R)\n    *   New C2 (was original C6): Configuration is **R**. -> (2R)\n    *   New C4 (was original C4): Configuration is **R**. -> (4R)\n    *   New C5 (was original C3): Configuration is **R**. -> (5R)\n*   **Final Product Name:** Combining the name and stereochemistry gives **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Result with the Options**\nThe calculated product name (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol matches option B.\n\nA) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\nB) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Correct)\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern)\nD) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect substitution pattern and stereochemistry)\n\n<<<B>>>"
