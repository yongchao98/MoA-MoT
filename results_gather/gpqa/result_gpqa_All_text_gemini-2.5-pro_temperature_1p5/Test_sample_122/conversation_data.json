    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames and Given Information:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference. Let's call them:\n        *   **S (Galaxy Frame):** This is the \"stationary\" reference frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n        *   **S' (Ejecta Frame):** This is the \"moving\" reference frame.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is given. The Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at v = 60,000 km/s. By the principle of relativity, the ejecta is also moving at this speed relative to the Galaxy.\n        *   **v = 60,000 km/s**\n    *   The time interval is measured in the ejecta's reference frame (S').\n        *   **Δt' = 50 s**\n    *   The question asks for the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n        *   **Goal: Find d**\n\n2.  **Recognize the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The speed of the ejecta (60,000 km/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s). Therefore, we must use the principles of Special Relativity.\n    *   The key principle here is **Time Dilation**. A clock moving relative to an observer appears to tick slower than a stationary clock. The time measured in the moving frame (S') is the *proper time* (Δt₀ or Δt'), while the time measured by the stationary observer (in frame S) is the *dilated time* (Δt).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   To find the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame (S), we need to use the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy frame (S).\n    *   We are given the time elapsed in the ejecta frame (S'), which is the proper time `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   We need to use the time dilation formula to find `Δt` from `Δt'`.\n    *   The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we must calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n### Execution of the Plan\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n\n*   The Lorentz factor is defined as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   First, find the ratio `β = v/c`:\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n    *   `β = 60,000 / 300,000 = 6/30 = 1/5 = 0.2`\n*   Now, calculate `γ`:\n    *   `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt)**\n\n*   Use the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n*   We know `Δt' = 50 s` and `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`.\n*   `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d)**\n\n*   Use the formula `d = v * Δt`.\n*   Substitute the expressions for `v` and `Δt`:\n    *   `d = (60,000 km/s) * [ (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s ]`\n*   Rearrange the terms for easier calculation:\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n*   Now, calculate the final value:\n    *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979796`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.979796 km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,961 km`\n\n**Step D: Compare the result with the given options**\n\n*   Our calculated distance is approximately 3,061,961 km.\n*   The options are:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the result if relativistic effects were ignored).\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n*   The calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is due to rounding. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame is the *proper time* (Δt'), because the clock measuring the time is at rest in that frame.\n2.  **Time Dilation Direction:** Remember that the time measured by the stationary observer (Δt) is always *longer* than the proper time (Δt'), because moving clocks run slow. This means `Δt = γ * Δt'`, and since `γ ≥ 1`, `Δt ≥ Δt'`.\n3.  **Frame Consistency:** When calculating the distance in the Galaxy frame (`d = v * Δt`), you must use the time measured in that same frame (`Δt`), not the time from the moving frame (`Δt'`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
