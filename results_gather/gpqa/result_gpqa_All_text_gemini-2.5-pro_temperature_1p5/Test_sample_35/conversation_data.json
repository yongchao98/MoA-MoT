    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks us to identify the type of interstellar medium in the Milky Way that would produce a spectral line equivalent to the one observed from a distant structure. The observation is of an *absorption line*, and we are given its observed energy and the distance to the source. The key is to find the original (rest-frame) energy of the line and then identify what common transition in our galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) corresponds to that energy.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Redshift (z)\nThe light from a source at a cosmological distance is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. We first need to calculate this redshift (z) from the given distance.\n\n*   **Given Distance (D):** 2.1 Gpc (gigaparsecs) = 2100 Mpc (megaparsecs).\n*   **Hubble-Lemaître Law:** The recessional velocity (v) of a galaxy is related to its distance by the Hubble-Lemaître law: v = H₀ * D, where H₀ is the Hubble constant.\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** A commonly accepted value is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc.\n*   **Calculate Velocity (v):**\n    v = (70 km/s/Mpc) * (2100 Mpc) = 147,000 km/s.\n*   **Calculate Redshift (z):** For velocities that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s), redshift is defined as z = v/c.\n    z = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49.\n\nSo, the redshift of the absorbing structure is approximately z = 0.49.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest)\nThe observed energy (E_obs) of a photon is lower than its rest-frame energy (E_rest) due to redshift. The relationship is:\nE_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\n*   **Given Observed Energy (E_obs):** 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n*   **Calculated Redshift (z):** 0.49.\n*   **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy (E_rest):**\n    E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49)\n    E_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49\n    E_rest ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\nThe energy of the absorption line in its own reference frame (at the location of the absorbing gas) is about 5.81 micro-electron-volts (μeV).\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Corresponding Transition in the Milky Way\nNow we need to find a well-known spectral line from the interstellar medium with an energy close to 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\n*   Let's consider the most famous spectral line in radio astronomy: the **21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I)**.\n*   This line arises from a hyperfine transition, where the spin of the electron flips relative to the spin of the proton.\n*   The frequency (f) of this transition is 1420.4 MHz (1.4204 x 10⁹ Hz).\n*   We can calculate its energy using Planck's relation, E = h * f, where h is Planck's constant (h ≈ 4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s).\n    E = (4.136 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) * (1.4204 * 10⁹ s⁻¹)\n    E ≈ 5.87 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\nThis calculated energy for the 21 cm H I line (5.87 μeV) is an excellent match for our calculated rest-frame energy (5.81 μeV). The small difference is due to the approximations used for the Hubble constant. Therefore, the absorption line is almost certainly the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the State of the Medium\nThe final step is to determine which phase of the atomic medium is responsible for this *absorption* line.\n\n*   Neutral atomic hydrogen (H I) exists in two main phases in the ISM: the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).\n*   **Warm Atomic Medium (WNM):** This gas is at a high temperature (T ≈ 8000 K). At this temperature, the populations of the two spin states are nearly equal, making it a very weak absorber. The 21 cm line from the WNM is typically seen in *emission*.\n*   **Cold Atomic Medium (CNM):** This gas is at a low temperature (T ≈ 100 K). At this temperature, there is a slight overpopulation of the lower energy state. When this cold gas is situated in front of a bright, high-temperature background radio source (like a quasar), it produces a strong 21 cm *absorption* line.\n*   Since the problem states that a distinct **absorption line** was detected, it is characteristic of the **Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  The observed energy (3.9 μeV) from a source at z≈0.49 corresponds to a rest-frame energy of ≈5.8 μeV.\n2.  This energy matches the 21 cm transition of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I).\n3.  Strong absorption in the 21 cm line is a key tracer of the Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium.\n\nTherefore, the observation is of a medium equivalent to the Cold Atomic Interstellar Medium in our own Milky Way.\n\n<<<C>>>"
