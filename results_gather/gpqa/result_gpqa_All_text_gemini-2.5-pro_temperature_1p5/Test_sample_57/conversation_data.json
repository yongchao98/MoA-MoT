    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept: Regularization at High Energies**\n    *   In physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations for interactions between particles often involve integrals over all possible energies or momenta.\n    *   Sometimes, these integrals diverge; they go to infinity. This typically happens when considering contributions from very high energies (or equivalently, very short distances). This is known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence\".\n    *   **Regularization** is a mathematical technique used to handle these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory, for instance, by introducing an energy \"cutoff,\" to make the divergent integrals finite. After the calculation is done, a related process called renormalization is used to absorb these infinities into the definitions of physical quantities (like mass and charge), yielding finite predictions that can be compared with experiments.\n    *   A theory that requires regularization is one that has these inherent mathematical infinities in its perturbative calculations. A theory that *never* requires it would be one that is \"UV-finite,\" meaning its calculations yield finite results from the outset, even when considering all energy scales.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option**\n\n    *   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of light and matter interaction (photons and electrons). It is a highly successful Quantum Field Theory. However, when calculating quantities involving virtual particle loops (quantum fluctuations), QED produces infinite results. For example, the calculation of an electron's self-energy diverges. QED *critically requires* the procedures of regularization and renormalization to make sense of these infinities and produce its incredibly precise predictions. Therefore, QED is not the answer.\n\n    *   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is the quantum theory of the strong nuclear force, describing interactions between quarks and gluons. Like QED, it is a Quantum Field Theory. It also suffers from ultraviolet (UV) divergences in loop calculations. Similar to QED, QCD *absolutely requires* regularization and renormalization to be a predictive theory. Therefore, QCD is not the answer.\n\n    *   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. It is a *classical* theory, not a quantum one, so it doesn't have the quantum loop divergences found in QED and QCD. However, it has its own famous divergence problem: the self-energy of an idealized point charge is infinite. If you calculate the energy stored in the electric field of a point particle, the result diverges as the radius approaches zero. This is a high-energy/short-distance problem that exists even at the classical level. To get a finite answer, one has to introduce a cutoff (i.e., \"regularize\" the problem by assuming the charge is not a true point but has a small, finite radius). So, in a sense, classical electrodynamics also requires a form of regularization to deal with an infinity.\n\n    *   **B) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to be a unified theory of everything, including quantum gravity. Its fundamental premise is that elementary particles are not point-like, but rather one-dimensional \"strings\". This seemingly small change has a profound consequence. The finite size of the strings (related to the Planck length) naturally \"smears out\" interactions at very short distances. This smearing effect acts as a natural, built-in cutoff for high energies. As a result, the calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are believed to be finite at all orders of perturbation theory, without any UV divergences. Because it is inherently free from these high-energy infinities, it **does not require** the artificial procedure of regularization. This property of being \"UV-finite\" is one of the primary motivations for studying string theory.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n\n    *   QED and QCD are quantum field theories that are known to have UV divergences and explicitly require regularization.\n    *   Classical Electrodynamics has its own self-energy divergence for point particles.\n    *   Superstring Theory is specifically constructed in a way that is conjectured to be free of UV divergences, thus never requiring regularization. It is the only theory on the list designed to be inherently UV-finite.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Distinguish between Classical and Quantum Divergences:** The term \"regularization\" is most commonly associated with handling quantum loop divergences in QFT. While Classical Electrodynamics has a divergence, the nature is different.\n*   **Renormalizable vs. Finite:** QED and QCD are *renormalizable*. This means that although they have divergences, we have a systematic procedure (regularization + renormalization) to handle them and make finite predictions. This is different from being *finite*, which means there are no divergences to begin with. Superstring theory is conjectured to be finite.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Established:** Superstring Theory is still a theoretical framework and not an experimentally verified theory, but the question is about the mathematical properties of the theory as it is formulated.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Superstring Theory is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
