    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, `<S_y>`.\n\n**Step 1: Define the spin state and the spin operator.**\n\n*   The spin state of the electron is given as a two-component vector (spinor), `|ψ> = (3i, 4)`. In column vector notation, this is:\n    ```\n    |ψ> = \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    3i \\\\\n    4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ```\n    This vector is represented in the standard basis where the first component corresponds to spin-up `|+z>` and the second to spin-down `|-z>`.\n\n*   The spin operator along the y-direction, `S_y`, is related to the Pauli spin matrix `σ_y` by the formula `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n*   The problem provides the matrix for `σ_y`:\n    ```\n    σ_y = \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & -i \\\\\n    i & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ```\n*   Therefore, the `S_y` operator is:\n    ```\n    S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & -i \\\\\n    i & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Write down the formula for the expectation value.**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ>` is given by the formula:\n`<A> = \\frac{<ψ|A|ψ>}{<ψ|ψ>}`\n\nIn our case, this becomes:\n`<S_y> = \\frac{<ψ|S_y|ψ>}{<ψ|ψ>}`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the terms in the formula.**\n\nWe need to calculate two parts: the denominator `<ψ|ψ>` (the normalization factor) and the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`.\n\n**Part A: Calculate the denominator `<ψ|ψ>`**\n\n*   First, we need to find the \"bra\" vector, `<ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose (or Hermitian conjugate) of the \"ket\" vector `|ψ>`.\n    ```\n    |ψ> = \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    3i \\\\\n    4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ```\n*   The transpose is `(3i, 4)`.\n*   The complex conjugate of the transpose is `(-3i, 4)`. So,\n    ```\n    <ψ| = \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -3i & 4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ```\n*   Now, we calculate the inner product `<ψ|ψ>`:\n    ```\n    <ψ|ψ> = \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -3i & 4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    3i \\\\\n    4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n          = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)\n          = -9i² + 16\n          = -9(-1) + 16\n          = 9 + 16\n          = 25\n    ```\n\n**Careful Point:** Remember that `i² = -1`. A common mistake is to forget this or miscalculate the complex conjugate. The result of `<ψ|ψ>` must be a real, non-negative number.\n\n**Part B: Calculate the numerator `<ψ|S_y|ψ>`**\n\n*   This is a three-part calculation. It's often easiest to first calculate `S_y|ψ>`.\n    ```\n    S_y|ψ> = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & -i \\\\\n    i & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    3i \\\\\n    4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n           = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\\n    (i)(3i) + (0)(4)\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n           = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -4i \\\\\n    3i²\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n           = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -4i \\\\\n    -3\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ```\n*   Now, we multiply this result by `<ψ|` from the left.\n    ```\n    <ψ|S_y|ψ> = \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -3i & 4\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -4i \\\\\n    -3\n    \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n             = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \\right]\n             = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ 12i² - 12 \\right]\n             = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ -12 - 12 \\right]\n             = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (-24)\n             = -12\\hbar\n    ```\n\n**Careful Point:** Keep the constant `ħ/2` throughout the calculation and pay close attention to the signs and `i² = -1` when performing the final multiplication.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to get the final answer.**\n\nNow we use the main formula for the expectation value:\n`<S_y> = \\frac{<ψ|S_y|ψ>}{<ψ|ψ>} = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}`\n\nThis can be written as `-12*hbar/25`. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) 12*hbar/25\nD) 25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
