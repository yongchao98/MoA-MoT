    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). This process converts their mass entirely into other forms of energy, which in this case are the rest mass and kinetic energy of four new particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    The reaction is: $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State and Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Particles:** A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   **Mass of Proton/Antiproton:** The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the exact same mass, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   **Initial Motion:** The antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a critical phrase in particle physics problems. It implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. For this type of symmetric annihilation, it's standard to assume the process happens \"at rest\" in the center-of-mass frame. This means the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial kinetic energy is also approximately zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   **Particles:** Four particles are produced: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are antiparticles of each other, they must have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   **Mass of Particle A:** We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the reaction must equal the total momentum after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Initial Energy:** Based on the \"slowly moving\" assumption, we take the initial kinetic energy of the system to be zero. Therefore, the total initial energy is purely the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   **Final State Energy & Momentum Distribution:** The initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. The question asks for \"the velocity\" of particle A, implying a single, unique value. This strongly suggests a symmetric decay where the available kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four final particles. This means all four particles will have the same speed.\n    *   **Relativistic Mechanics:** The energies involved (hundreds of MeV) are comparable to the rest mass energies of the particles. Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically the formulas for relativistic energy and momentum. Using classical mechanics ($K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) would give an incorrect result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$)**\nSince the proton and antiproton are considered to be at rest, their energy is their rest mass energy.\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy to find the total final energy ($E_{final}$)**\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, $E_{final} = E_{initial}$.\n$E_{final} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\nThis total final energy is shared among the four A particles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy of a single final particle A ($E_A$)**\nDue to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of equal mass), we can assume the total energy is distributed equally among them.\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\nThis is the total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) of one particle A.\n\n**Step 4: Use the relativistic energy formula to find the velocity ($v$)**\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nWe have:\n*   Total energy of one particle A: $E_A = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy of one particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nFinally, we solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the value for $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
