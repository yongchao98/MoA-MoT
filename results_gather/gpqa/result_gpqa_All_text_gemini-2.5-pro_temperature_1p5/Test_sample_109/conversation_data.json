    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the requirements for joint detection.**\n\nA star must satisfy the conditions for *both* observatories simultaneously. Let's break down the conditions for each observatory.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Spectrograph (Paranal Observatory):**\n    *   **Location:** Paranal Observatory is in Chile, in the Southern Hemisphere. Its latitude (φ) is approximately -25° S.\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17. So, **V < 17 mag**.\n\n*   **HIRES Spectrograph (W. M. Keck Observatory):**\n    *   **Location:** Keck Observatory is in Hawaii, in the Northern Hemisphere. Its latitude (φ) is approximately +20° N.\n    *   **Magnitude Limit:** Can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, **V < 16 mag**.\n\n*   **Combined Conditions:**\n    1.  **Magnitude:** For a star to be detectable by both, it must satisfy the stricter magnitude limit, which is that of HIRES. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16 mag**.\n    2.  **Visibility (Declination):** The star must be visible from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Although we disregard specific pointing limits, a star must rise above the horizon to be seen.\n        *   For Keck (φ ≈ +20° N), stars with a declination (DEC) less than `φ - 90°` (i.e., +20° - 90° = -70°) will never rise. So, we need **DEC > -70°**.\n        *   For Paranal (φ ≈ -25° S), stars with a declination greater than `90° - |φ|` (i.e., 90° - 25° = +65°) will never rise. So, we need **DEC < +65°**.\n        *   Combining these, the star must have a declination in the range **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n**Summary of requirements for a star to be detected by both:**\n1.  Apparent V Magnitude (V) < 16 mag.\n2.  Declination (DEC) must be between -70° and +65°.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each star against the combined requirements.**\n\nWe will now check each star to see if it meets both conditions. For stars where the apparent magnitude is not given, we will calculate it using the distance modulus formula:\n`V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc) + A_V`\nwhere V is the apparent magnitude, M_V is the absolute magnitude, d is the distance in parsecs, and A_V is the total absorption in the V band. A_V is calculated as `3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70° < DEC < +65°). It is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = 55°. This is within the required range. **(Pass)**\n    *   **Magnitude:** Apparent V magnitude is given as V = 16.5 mag. This is not less than 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both (it is too faint for HIRES).\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = 48°. This is within the required range. **(Pass)**\n    *   **Magnitude:** The apparent V magnitude is given as V = 15.5 mag. This is less than 16. **(Pass)**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Can be detected by both.\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range. **(Pass)**\n    *   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the apparent V magnitude.\n        *   Absorption A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   Apparent magnitude V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc) + A_V\n        *   V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This value (16.74 mag) is not less than 16.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be detected by both (it is too faint for HIRES).\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Declination:** DEC = 60°. This is within the required range. **(Pass)**\n    *   **Magnitude:** We must calculate the apparent V magnitude. (No extinction is mentioned, so A_V = 0).\n        *   Apparent magnitude V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc)\n        *   V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This value (~15.0 mag) is less than 16. **(Pass)**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Can be detected by both.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, the stars that satisfy both the visibility and magnitude requirements for both observatories are **Star3** and **Star5**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
