    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from a host star. A planet's gravity causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a small, periodic change in the star's velocity along our line of sight (its radial velocity). This change in velocity causes the star's spectral lines to shift back and forth periodically.\n\n*   The relationship between the radial velocity (v_r) and the wavelength shift (Δλ) is given by the Doppler effect formula: Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c, where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n*   This means the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, called the RV semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Formula for RV Semi-amplitude (K)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K of the star is given by:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   M_p is the mass of the planet.\n*   M_star is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Formula Using the Information Provided**\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information that allow us to simplify the relationship between K and P.\n\n*   **\"Circular orbits\":** This means the eccentricity `e` is 0. The formula used is already for circular orbits.\n*   **\"Stars with exactly the same masses\":** M_star1 = M_star2.\n*   **\"Planets... with masses similar to that of Neptune\":** M_p1 ≈ M_p2.\n*   **\"The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun\":** This confirms that M_star >> M_p (Sun mass >> Neptune mass), so we can approximate (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star.\n*   **Careful Point (Orbital Inclination `i`):** The problem does not specify the orbital inclination. In such comparative problems, it is standard to assume that the unknown factors are the same for both systems. Therefore, we assume sin(i₁) = sin(i₂).\n\nGiven these simplifications, the terms G, M_p, sin(i), and M_star are all constant when comparing the two systems. Thus, the formula for K simplifies to a proportionality:\n\nK ∝ (1 / P)^(1/3)  or  K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n**Step 4: Combine Proportionalities and Form a Ratio**\n\nWe have two key proportionalities:\n1.  K ∝ Δλ (from Step 1)\n2.  K ∝ P^(-1/3) (from Step 3)\n\nCombining these, we find the relationship between the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) and the orbital period (P):\n\nΔλ ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nNow we can set up a ratio for the two planet systems:\n\n(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods (P₂ / P₁)**\n\nWe need to rearrange the equation to solve for P₂ / P₁.\n\n1.  Start with the ratio: (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n2.  Cube both sides to remove the cube root: (Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^3 = P₁ / P₂\n3.  Invert both sides to get the desired ratio: P₂ / P₁ = (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)^3\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Given Values and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem gives us the wavelength shifts:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n\nSubstitute these into our final equation:\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36443\n\nThis result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes physical sense: planet #2 causes a larger stellar wobble (larger Δλ and K), which for a similar mass planet implies it must be in a tighter, faster orbit with a shorter period.\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
