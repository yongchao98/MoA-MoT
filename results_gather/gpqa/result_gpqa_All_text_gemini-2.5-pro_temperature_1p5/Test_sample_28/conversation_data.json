    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To stop the synthesis of the compound, we need to inactivate this gene so it no longer produces a functional protein. The most effective way to achieve this is by introducing a mutation that leads to a non-functional or severely truncated protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the start of the coding strand of the gene's first exon.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n*   `ATG` is the start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). This confirms we are at the beginning of the protein-coding sequence.\n*   The sequence is read in groups of three bases, called codons.\n*   Let's determine the initial amino acid sequence of the functional protein by reading the codons:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   ... and so on.\nThe initial part of the healthy protein is: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant and its Consequences**\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence to see how the mutation affects the resulting protein. The most severe mutations are typically nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (inserting or deleting bases in a number not divisible by three).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The `TTTCTC` from the intact gene is changed to `TTCTAC`.\n    *   Codon changes:\n        *   Intact: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC`\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG` `TTC` `TAC`\n    *   Protein translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met\n        *   `TTC` -> Phe (`TTT` also codes for Phe, so this part is a silent mutation).\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). The original codon `CTC` coded for Leucine.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein chain (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might or might not inactivate the protein. It is less likely to completely eliminate function compared to more severe mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The `TTTCTC` from the intact gene is changed to `TTCTAA`.\n    *   Codon changes:\n        *   Intact: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC`\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG` `TTC` `TAA`\n    *   Protein translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met\n        *   `TTC` -> Phe (silent mutation)\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons in the genetic code.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The original sequence `...TTTCTCG...` has been changed to `...TTTTACG...`. A single 'T' has been inserted after the `TTT` codon.\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG...` (The reading frame is shifted from this point on).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion of a single nucleotide shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons. The entire amino acid sequence after the second amino acid (Phe) will be different from the original, creating a \"garbage\" protein. Frameshift mutations often also create a premature stop codon by chance downstream. This type of mutation is highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: Analysis shows that the codon `GGT` (coding for Glycine) has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` -> Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` -> Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine) and a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine). Because a full codon (3 bases) was deleted, the reading frame is maintained for the rest of the gene. While removing/changing amino acids can disrupt function, it is less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Which Mutation is Most Likely to Succeed**\n*   Mutants 1 (missense) and 4 (in-frame deletion/missense) alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n*   Mutants 2 (nonsense) and 3 (frameshift) are both severe mutations that are highly likely to create a non-functional protein (a \"null allele\").\n*   However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most direct and definitive. It causes protein synthesis to stop almost immediately, producing a mere two-amino-acid fragment. There is no ambiguity; the functional protein will not be made. This is the most certain way to eliminate the compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 offers the highest probability of success.\n\n<<<A>>>"
