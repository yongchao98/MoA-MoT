    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for a factor by which a specific ratio changes. The ratio is of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two different energy levels (`N2/N1`). We need to find `Factor = (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_with_spots`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in energy level `j` and `i`.\n*   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`1.38 * 10^-23` J/K).\n*   `T` is the local temperature of the gas.\n\nFor our specific case, let `i=1` and `j=2`. Let `Ratio = N2 / N1`.\n`Ratio(T) = (g2 / g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1) / (k * T))`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Temperatures for Comparison**\nThe problem gives two scenarios:\n1.  **No spots:** The effective temperature `T_eff` is 6000 K. We will use this as our first temperature, `T_no_spots = 6000 K`.\n2.  **With spots:** 40% of the surface is covered by spots, and the *overall* effective temperature drops to 5500 K.\n\nThere's a subtle point here. The overall effective temperature is a measure of the total radiated flux, not the actual temperature of any specific part of the photosphere (which consists of hotter quiet regions and cooler spot regions). However, the problem sets up a comparison between the unspotted star (T=6000K) and the spotted star, for which the characteristic temperature is given as 5500 K. The most straightforward interpretation, and the one that typically works for such problems, is to use these effective temperatures as the temperatures in the Boltzmann equation.\n*   `T1 = T_no_spots = 6000 K`\n*   `T2 = T_with_spots = 5500 K`\n\nThe other information (star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage) is likely provided for context or to act as a potential distractor, as it's not needed if we directly use the given effective temperatures.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\nThe energy difference `ΔE = E2 - E1` corresponds to a transition with a wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.\n`ΔE = h * c / λ`\nwhere `h` is Planck's constant (`6.626 * 10^-34` J·s) and `c` is the speed of light (`3 * 10^8` m/s).\n`λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10^-10` m.\n\nIt is computationally easier to calculate the term `ΔE/k` that appears in the exponent of the Boltzmann equation.\n`ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)`\n`ΔE / k = (6.626 * 10^-34 J·s * 3 * 10^8 m/s) / (1448 * 10^-10 m * 1.38 * 10^-23 J/K)`\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.9878 * 10^-25) / (1.99824 * 10^-30) ≈ 99477 K`\n\n**Step 5: Set Up and Calculate the Factor**\nWe need to find the factor `F = Ratio_no_spots / Ratio_with_spots`.\n\n`Ratio_no_spots = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T1))`\n`Ratio_with_spots = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T2))`\n\nThe factor `F` is the ratio of these two expressions. The `(g2/g1)` term cancels out.\n`F = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T1))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T2))]`\n\nUsing the properties of exponents (`exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)`):\n`F = exp[ -ΔE/(k*T1) + ΔE/(k*T2) ]`\n`F = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]`\n\nNow, substitute the numerical values:\n*   `ΔE/k ≈ 99477 K`\n*   `T1 = 6000 K`\n*   `T2 = 5500 K`\n\n`1/T2 - 1/T1 = 1/5500 - 1/6000`\n`1/T2 - 1/T1 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000` K⁻¹\n\nNow, calculate the exponent:\n`Exponent = 99477 * (1 / 66000) ≈ 1.507`\n\nFinally, calculate the factor `F`:\n`F = exp(1.507)`\n`F ≈ 4.513`\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in the two levels changes is approximately 4.5. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
