    "This question asks us to identify the set of assumptions that collectively constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that an interaction with a nucleus can be treated as an interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon inside it. Let's analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concept: Impulse Approximation**\n    The impulse approximation simplifies a complex many-body problem (an external probe interacting with a nucleus) into a simpler two-body problem (the probe interacting with a single nucleon). The name \"impulse\" comes from the idea that the interaction happens over an extremely short time. During this brief moment, the struck nucleon receives a large momentum transfer (an impulse), and its interaction with the other nucleons (the binding potential) can be neglected. The nucleon effectively behaves like a free particle during the collision.\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This assumption states that the probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino) couples to a single nucleon at a time. It explicitly excludes more complex interactions, such as those involving pairs of nucleons simultaneously (two-body currents) or interactions with the mesons being exchanged between nucleons (mesonic-exchange currents).\n    *   **Relevance:** This is the foundational assumption of the impulse approximation. To treat the interaction as a collision with one nucleon, we must first assume that the interaction *happens* with only one nucleon. This is a critical first step.\n\n3.  **Analyze Statement 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This implies that the incoming probe particle enters the nucleus, interacts with the chosen nucleon, and then both the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon leave the nucleus without any further interactions with the other nucleons. These secondary interactions are known as final-state interactions (FSI).\n    *   **Relevance:** This assumption is crucial for making the final state of the system simple to calculate. If the outgoing particles re-scatter, the process is no longer a clean one-on-one collision, and the nucleon's behavior does not cleanly mirror that of a free particle, which would simply travel away unimpeded after the collision. This is often part of the *Plane Wave Impulse Approximation* (PWIA), a common implementation of the impulse approximation. To fully claim the nucleon behaves \"in the same way as a free nucleon\" throughout the entire scattering process, this assumption is necessary.\n\n4.  **Analyze Statement 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, describing the motion of its constituent quarks.\n    *   **Relevance:** This is an assumption about the model of the nucleon, not about the nucleon's interaction within the nucleus. The impulse approximation can be applied regardless of how one models the nucleon's internal structure (e.g., using relativistic form factors derived from experimental data). Therefore, this assumption is on a different level of theory and is not a required component of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n5.  **Analyze Statement 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    *   **Meaning:** This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. It assumes that the interaction is very fast (corresponding to high momentum and energy transfer). Over this short timescale, the relatively slow-acting nuclear forces that bind the nucleon in place are negligible. The nucleon's potential energy from the nuclear binding potential is insignificant compared to the energy exchanged during the collision.\n    *   **Relevance:** This is a cornerstone of the approximation. It's what allows us to treat the bound nucleon's kinematics during the collision as if it were a free particle, ignoring its potential energy and off-shell nature at the moment of interaction.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis:\n\nTo make a nucleon in a nucleus behave like a free nucleon during an interaction, we need to assume:\n*   The interaction happens with just that one nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The nucleon's binding forces are negligible during the very brief interaction (Statement 4).\n*   The particles involved in the collision are not affected by the rest of the nucleus before or after the event (Statement 2).\n\nStatement 3 is not a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
