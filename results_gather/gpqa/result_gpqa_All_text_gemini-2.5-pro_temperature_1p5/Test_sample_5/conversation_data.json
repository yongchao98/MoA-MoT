    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Potential**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe problem becomes much simpler if we can express the potential in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstitute these relationships into the potential function:\n*   The first term is 1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2).\n*   The second term is 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ). We can rewrite this as 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 k x^2.\n\nNow, combine the terms to get the potential in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y):\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the System as Two Independent Harmonic Oscillators**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is a sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is decoupled from the motion in the y-direction. Therefore, we can solve the Schrödinger equation for each dimension separately and add the energies.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Energy Spectrum for Each 1D Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe general form for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator potential is V = 1/2 mω^2 x^2, where ω is the angular frequency. The energy spectrum for this system is given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\nWe can also write the potential as V = 1/2 Kx^2, where K is the effective spring constant. The angular frequency is then ω = sqrt(K/m).\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 * (4k) * x^2\n    The effective spring constant is k_x = 4k.\n    The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m).\n    The energy levels for the x-motion are:\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n    The effective spring constant is k_y = k.\n    The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is ω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m).\n    The energy levels for the y-motion are:\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Energies to Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nSince the oscillators are independent, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, factor out the common term ℏ*sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 2*(1/2) + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m).\nThis matches option B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Coordinate System:** The most critical step is converting the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates. A mistake here would lead to an incorrect form of the potential.\n2.  **Identifying Oscillators:** The potential V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 must be correctly identified with the standard 1D QHO potential V = 1/2 Kx^2 to find the effective spring constants k_x and k_y.\n3.  **Angular Frequency Formula:** Remember that ω = sqrt(K/m), where K is the effective spring constant. Don't confuse the k in the problem with the spring constant for each oscillator directly.\n4.  **Algebraic Summation:** Ensure the final algebraic summation of the energy components is done correctly, especially handling the constant terms (the zero-point energies).\n\nThe final answer is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m).\n\n<<<B>>>"
