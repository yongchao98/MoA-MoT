    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core chemical process.**\nWe are dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), by adding a strong acid. The acid provides H⁺ ions that react with the OH⁻ ions produced by the Fe(OH)₃. This neutralization shifts the solubility equilibrium, allowing the solid to dissolve.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass (Fe) ≈ 55.85 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass (H) ≈ 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNow, calculate the moles from the given mass:\n*   moles = mass / molar mass\n*   moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimum volume of acid required.**\nThe \"minimum volume\" typically refers to the stoichiometric amount of reactant needed. According to the balanced equation, 3 moles of H⁺ are required to react with and dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ required = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol = 0.002807 mol.\n\nThe problem specifies a 0.1 M strong acid, which means it provides 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter.\n*   Volume (L) = moles / concentration\n*   Volume (L) = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n\nTo convert this volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000:\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the pH of the resulting solution.**\nFor the solid to dissolve completely, the final concentration of ions in the solution must not exceed the solubility product constant (Ksp). The condition to be \"just dissolved\" is when the ion product (Qsp) equals Ksp.\n\n*   First, find the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution:\n    [Fe³⁺] = moles / volume = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\n*   The solubility equilibrium is Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq), with Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³.\n*   A commonly accepted value for the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 4 x 10⁻³⁸.\n\n*   We can calculate the maximum [OH⁻] allowed in the solution for the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved:\n    [OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺] = (4 x 10⁻³⁸) / 0.009356 ≈ 4.27 x 10⁻³⁶ M³\n    [OH⁻] = (4.27 x 10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) ≈ 1.62 x 10⁻¹² M.\n\n*   Now, use the ion product of water (Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) to find the required [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.62 x 10⁻¹²) ≈ 0.00617 M.\n\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    pH = -log([H⁺]) = -log(0.00617) ≈ 2.21.\n\nThis means for the Fe(OH)₃ to be fully dissolved, the pH must be ≤ 2.21.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the calculated values with the given options.**\n*   **Volume:** Our calculated volume of 28.07 cm³ strongly matches the value of 28.05 cm³ in option D.\n*   **pH:** Our analysis shows the pH must be ≤ 2.21. Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) pH 2.69 (Too high)\n    *   B) pH 3.16 (Too high)\n    *   C) pH 4.94 (Too high)\n    *   D) pH 2.04 (This satisfies the condition pH ≤ 2.21).\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth the volume calculation and the pH analysis point directly to option D. While there is a slight internal inconsistency in the problem's values (the calculated pH for a solution made with the stoichiometric volume of acid would be closer to 2.29 due to Fe³⁺ hydrolysis), option D is by far the most plausible and is the only one that meets the chemical requirements for dissolution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
