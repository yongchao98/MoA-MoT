    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the principles of dimensional analysis in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar = c = 1$, mass, energy, and momentum all have the dimension of mass, which we denote as $[M]$. Length and time have the dimension of inverse mass, $[M]^{-1}$.\n\n1.  **The Action ($S$) is dimensionless.** The action is defined as $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian density. The action appears in the path integral as $e^{iS/\\hbar}$. Since the exponent must be a pure number, and $\\hbar=1$, the action $S$ must be dimensionless. We write this as $[S]_M = 0$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of the spacetime volume element ($d^4x$).** Since $x$ has the dimension of length, which is $[M]^{-1}$, the four-dimensional spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = ([M]^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$.\n\n3.  **Dimension of the Lagrangian density ($\\mathcal{L}$).** From the definition of the action, we have $[S]_M = [d^4x]_M [\\mathcal{L}]_M$. Substituting the known dimensions, we get $0 = -4 + [\\mathcal{L}]_M$. Therefore, the mass dimension of any Lagrangian density (and any term within it) must be $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term**\n\nThe given interaction Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We know that $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = 4$.\n\n1.  **Dimension of the fermion field ($\\psi$).** We determine the dimension of a field from its kinetic term. For a Dirac fermion, the kinetic term is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin} = \\bar{\\psi} i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The dimension of this term must be 4: $[\\bar{\\psi} i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi]_M = 4$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has the dimension of momentum, so $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices.\n    *   The dimensions of $\\psi$ and its adjoint $\\bar{\\psi}$ are the same: $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M$.\n    *   So, the dimensional equation is $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4$.\n    *   $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$.\n    *   $2[\\psi]_M = 3$, which gives $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$).** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   The dimension of this term is 4: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   This implies $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   Therefore, $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n    *   (Alternatively, from $F^{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial^\\mu A^\\nu - \\partial^\\nu A^\\mu$ and knowing the vector potential $A^\\mu$ has mass dimension 1, we get $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = [\\partial^\\mu]_M + [A^\\nu]_M = 1 + 1 = 2$).\n\n3.  **Dimension of $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$.** The tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$, where $\\gamma_\\mu$ are the gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can write the dimensional equation for the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$4 = [\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2$\n$4 = [\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2$\n$4 = [\\kappa]_M + 5$\n\nSolving for $[\\kappa]_M$:\n$[\\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1$\n\n**Step 4: Determine if the theory is renormalizable**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension (e.g., $[g]_M > 0$), the interaction is called **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (e.g., $[g]_M = 0$), the interaction is called **renormalizable** (or strictly renormalizable). The coupling in QED is an example.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension (e.g., $[g]_M < 0$), the interaction is called **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. A negative mass dimension means that at higher and higher energies (in loop calculations), new, more severe divergences will appear at each order of perturbation theory. These cannot be absorbed by redefining a finite number of parameters, making the theory non-renormalizable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
