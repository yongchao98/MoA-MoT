    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Aperture Shape in the Limit of N -> ∞**\n*   The aperture is a regular N-sided polygon.\n*   The apothem 'a' is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of any side. This is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n*   Let 'R' be the radius of the polygon, which is the distance from the center to any vertex. 'R' is the radius of the circumscribed circle.\n*   The relationship between the apothem 'a' and the radius 'R' for a regular N-sided polygon is given by `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n*   The problem asks for the case where N becomes infinitely large (N -> ∞).\n*   As N approaches infinity, the angle `π/N` approaches 0.\n*   Since `cos(0) = 1`, in the limit as N -> ∞, we have `a = R * cos(0) = R`.\n*   This means that as the number of sides becomes infinite, the distance from the center to a side (apothem) becomes equal to the distance from the center to a vertex (radius).\n*   Therefore, a regular N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle of radius 'a' as N tends to infinity.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Diffraction Problem**\n*   The problem is now reduced to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n*   The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern.\n*   The intensity `I(θ)` of the Airy pattern as a function of the diffraction angle `θ` is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center.\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Angular Positions of the Minima**\n*   Intensity minima occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is equal to zero, while the denominator is not zero.\n*   The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let the non-zero roots of `J₁(x)` be `j₁₁, j₁₂, j₁₃, ...`.\n*   The condition for the m-th minimum is `k * a * sin(θ_m) = j₁m`.\n*   The first few non-zero roots of `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n    *   `j₁₁ ≈ 3.8317` (This corresponds to the first minimum)\n    *   `j₁₂ ≈ 7.0156` (This corresponds to the second minimum)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Angular Position of the First Minimum (θ₁)**\n*   For the first minimum: `k * a * sin(θ₁) ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Substitute `k = 2π / λ`: `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ₁) ≈ 3.8317`\n*   The problem states we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ₁) ≈ θ₁`.\n*   `(2π / λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n*   Rounding to three decimal places, `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂)**\n*   For the second minimum: `k * a * sin(θ₂) ≈ 7.0156`\n*   Using the same substitutions and approximations: `(2π / λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n*   `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**\n*   The angular distance is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n*   `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n*   `Δθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a`\n*   `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\n**Step 7: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\n*   The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 * λ / a`.\n*   Let's look at the options:\n    A) 0.506 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ /a\n    C) 0.500 λ / c\n    D) 0.610 λ / d\n*   Our calculated value `0.5068 λ / a` is a very close match to option A, `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n1.  **N -> ∞ Limit:** Correctly identified that the polygon becomes a circle of radius 'a'. The apothem becomes the radius.\n2.  **Diffraction Pattern:** Correctly identified the problem as diffraction from a circular aperture (Airy pattern).\n3.  **Minima Condition:** Correctly used the zeros of the `J₁` Bessel function to find the minima.\n4.  **Correct Zeros:** Used the correct numerical values for the first two non-zero roots of `J₁`.\n5.  **Question Interpretation:** Correctly calculated the *difference* in angular positions (`θ₂ - θ₁`), not just the position of the first minimum (`θ₁`), which is a common pitfall (Option D is `θ₁`).\n6.  **Approximation:** Correctly applied the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`).\n\nThe analysis leads directly to the answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
