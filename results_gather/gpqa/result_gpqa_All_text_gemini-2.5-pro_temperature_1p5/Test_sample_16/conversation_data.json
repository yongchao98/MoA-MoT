    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as [Ca(EDTA)]^2- or [CaY]^2- (where Y^4- represents the fully deprotonated EDTA ion). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca^2+) and EDTA (Y^4-). The relevant chemical reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n    [CaY]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\n\n2.  **Determine the appropriate equilibrium constant:** The question provides the formation constant (K_f) for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA = 5.0 x 10^10. The reaction for formation is the reverse of our dissociation reaction:\n    Ca^2+ + Y^4- <=> [CaY]^2- , with K_f = [CaY]^2- / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-])\n\n    The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10^10) = 2.0 x 10^-11\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species. The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. We assume the initial concentrations of the dissociated ions are zero. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species         | [CaY]^2-  | Ca^2+ | Y^4-  |\n|-----------------|-----------|-------|-------|\n| **Initial (I)** | 0.02 M    | 0 M   | 0 M   |\n| **Change (C)**  | -x        | +x    | +x    |\n| **Equilibrium (E)**| 0.02 - x  | x     | x     |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation:** Now, we use the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, with the equilibrium concentrations from the table:\n    K_d = ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) / [CaY]^2-\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2.0 x 10^-11 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Solve for x (the concentration of Ca^2+):** The value of K_d (2.0 x 10^-11) is extremely small. This indicates that the dissociation reaction proceeds to a very small extent, meaning 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make a simplifying assumption:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now, substitute this approximation back into the equation:\n    2.0 x 10^-11 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n\n    Solve for x^2:\n    x^2 ≈ (2.0 x 10^-11) * 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ 4.0 x 10^-13\n\n    Solve for x by taking the square root:\n    x = sqrt(4.0 x 10^-13)\n    x = sqrt(40 x 10^-14)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M\n\n6.  **Verify the assumption:** We check if 'x' is indeed negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    6.32 x 10^-7 is much, much smaller than 0.02, so our simplifying assumption was valid.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca^2+], at equilibrium is equal to 'x'.\n    [Ca^2+] ≈ 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Formation vs. Dissociation:** Be clear about which reaction is occurring. Since we start with the complex, the relevant process is dissociation, and you must use the dissociation constant (K_d = 1/K_f).\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The dissociation of one mole of the complex produces one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA. This 1:1:1 stoichiometry simplifies the ICE table.\n*   **Ideal pH:** The problem states the pH is \"ideal\". This is a key condition. The formation constant K_f = 5.0 x 10^10 is the absolute constant, which is only applicable when EDTA is fully deprotonated (as Y^4-). This occurs at high pH (typically pH > 10). The \"ideal pH\" assumption allows us to use this K_f value directly without correcting for protonation of the EDTA ligand.\n*   **Approximation:** The simplifying assumption (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is valid because the equilibrium constant is very small. Always mentally check if the calculated 'x' is less than 5% of the initial concentration to confirm the assumption's validity. In this case, it is much less.\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
