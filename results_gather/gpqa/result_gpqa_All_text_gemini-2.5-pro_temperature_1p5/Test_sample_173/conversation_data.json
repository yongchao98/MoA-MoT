    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Parsing the Problem and Identifying Key Information\n\nFirst, we break down the information given in the problem statement and identify the key physical principles involved.\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. This means its initial total momentum is zero (P_initial = 0) and its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy (E_initial = M*c^2).\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** M*c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   **Fission Process:** The nucleus spontaneously splits into two fragments, which we'll call fragment 1 and fragment 2, with rest masses m1 and m2 respectively.\n*   **Mass Relation:** \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean m1 = m2 + 2*m2 = 3*m2, or it could be intended to mean m1 = 2*m2. Given that this is a physics problem with multiple-choice answers, one interpretation will likely lead to a correct option. We will test the interpretation m1 = 2*m2, assuming m1 is the more massive fragment.\n*   **Sum of Final Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** In this decay process, both total energy and momentum are conserved.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated using relativistic mechanics and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) mechanics. Let's call these T1_relativistic and T1_classical. The final answer is |T1_relativistic - T1_classical|.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Rest Masses and Total Kinetic Energy\n\nLet's use the given mass relations to find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments.\n\n1.  We have the system of equations:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\n2.  Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    *   (2*m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   3*m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   m2 = 0.33 * M\n\n3.  Now find m1:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\n4.  Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments using M*c^2 = 300 GeV:\n    *   m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\n5.  The total kinetic energy (T_total), also known as the Q-value, is the energy released from the conversion of rest mass.\n    *   T_total = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Sum of Final Rest-Mass Energies)\n    *   T_total = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n    *   T_total = 3000 MeV\n\n### Step 3: Calculating T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be p.\n    *   p1 = p2 = p\n\n2.  **Relating Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical\n    *   p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\n    *   Therefore, m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n    *   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2\n\n3.  **Distributing the Total Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   We know T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is T_total = T1_classical + T2_classical.\n    *   3000 MeV = T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 * T1_classical\n    *   T1_classical = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV\n\n### Step 4: Calculating T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy of a particle is E = T + m*c^2, and it's related to momentum by E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:**\n    *   Energy: E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV\n    *   Momentum: |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n2.  **Deriving T1_relativistic:** A standard formula for the energy of a decay product (fragment 1) in a 2-body decay from rest is:\n    *   E1 = [ (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ] / (2 * M*c^2)\n\n3.  **Plugging in the values:**\n    *   E1 = [ (300)^2 + (198)^2 - (99)^2 ] / (2 * 300)\n    *   E1 = [ 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ] / 600\n    *   E1 = [ 129204 - 9801 ] / 600\n    *   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\n\n4.  The relativistic kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n    *   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2\n    *   T1_relativistic = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n    *   T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the two calculated values for T1.\n\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV\n*   Difference = 5 MeV\n\nThis matches option B. If we had used the m1 = 3*m2 interpretation, the result would have been 7.5 MeV, which is not an option.\n\n<<<B>>>"
