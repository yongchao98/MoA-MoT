    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Experimental Setup**\n*   **Goal:** Express a recombinant GADD45G protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.\n*   **Construct Design:** The GADD45G coding sequence is engineered to have an N-terminal tag.\n*   **The Tag:** A single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Its sequence is known to be `YPYDVPDYA`. The DNA sequence encoding this is typically `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT`.\n*   **The Problem:** The protein is not being overexpressed as expected.\n*   **The Clue:** The DNA sequence of the constructed plasmid is provided. The task is to analyze this sequence to find the error.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the coding strand (plus strand), which has the same sequence as the resulting mRNA, with Thymine (T) instead of Uracil (U). Translation starts at the first `ATG` codon.\n\nThe sequence is:\n5' **ATG** TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA **TGA** CTCTGGAAGAAG... 3'\n\nLet's break this down into codons (groups of three nucleotides) and translate it into an amino acid sequence, just as a ribosome would.\n\n1.  `ATG`: This is the universal start codon, coding for Methionine (M). Translation begins here.\n2.  `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`: This part of the sequence encodes the HA tag.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    This translates to the amino acid sequence `YPYDVPDYA`, which is the correct HA tag. So far, the construct seems fine.\n\n3.  `AAA`: This codon comes immediately after the HA tag sequence. It codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n\n4.  `TGA`: This codon is crucial. In the genetic code, `TGA` (or `UGA` in mRNA) is one of the three **stop codons** (along with `TAA`/`UAA` and `TAG`/`UAG`).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Consequence of the Sequence**\nWhen the ribosome translates the mRNA transcribed from this DNA, it will proceed as follows:\n*   It starts at `AUG` (Methionine).\n*   It adds the HA tag amino acids (`YPYDVPDYA`).\n*   It adds one more amino acid, Lysine (`K`).\n*   It then encounters the `UGA` stop codon.\n*   Upon reaching a stop codon, translation is terminated. The ribosome dissociates from the mRNA, and the newly synthesized polypeptide is released.\n\nThe result is a very short peptide (M-YPYDVPDYA-K) and not the full-length GADD45G protein. This completely explains the failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options Based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.**\n    *   A linker might be good practice, but its absence doesn't automatically cause proteolysis. More importantly, the primary problem is that the full-length protein is never synthesized in the first place, so it cannot be degraded later. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.**\n    *   A missense mutation changes one amino acid to another. Our analysis shows the HA tag amino acid sequence `YPYDVPDYA` is correctly encoded. The change from the typical `GCT` to `GCC` is a silent mutation, as both code for Alanine. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.**\n    *   This statement is factually true (tRNAs do not recognize stop codons), but it is irrelevant for two reasons. First, the cell line is from a Chinese hamster, not a mouse. Second, and more importantly, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. The problem isn't a lack of a specific tRNA; it's the presence of an unwanted stop codon that actively stops translation. This option is misleading and incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early.**\n    *   This is exactly what our sequence analysis revealed. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon forces the ribosome to halt translation long before it can synthesize the actual GADD45G protein. This is the direct and accurate reason for the experimental failure.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe DNA sequence contains a premature stop codon (`TGA`) immediately after the HA tag sequence. This causes translation to terminate early, preventing the formation of the full-length GADD45G protein. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
