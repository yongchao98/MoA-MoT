    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question and relevant physical principles.**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$). The key principles involved are:\n1.  The Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T).\n2.  Wien's Displacement Law, which relates the surface temperature (T) of a star to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) at which it emits the most radiation.\n3.  The Doppler effect, which relates the observed wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{obs}$) to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{em}$) and the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the source.\n\n**Step 2: List the given information and identify any potential distractors.**\n*   Radius relation: $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$\n*   Mass relation: $M_1 = 1.5 \\times M_2$ (This is a distractor. While mass, radius, and luminosity are related, the Stefan-Boltzmann law gives a more direct way to solve the problem with the given information).\n*   Observed peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$. The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the light as observed from Earth.\n*   Radial velocities: $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s and $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s.\n*   Assumption: Stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the luminosity ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.**\nThe luminosity of a spherical black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nThe ratio of the luminosities is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the known radius ratio.**\nWe are given $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\nSo, $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\nThe luminosity ratio becomes: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$) by considering the observed peak wavelengths.**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. Temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max,em}$) by Wien's Law: $T = b/\\lambda_{max,em}$, where $b$ is a constant. Therefore, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}}$.\n\nWe need to find the relationship between the emitted wavelengths using the given information about the *observed* wavelengths. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{em}(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c})$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n*   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its emitted one: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 1}$.\n*   For Star_2: $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r,2}}{c})$.\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{max, em, 1} = \\lambda_{max, em, 2}(1 + \\frac{v_{r,2}}{c})$.\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths: $\\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$.\n\nSince $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{max,em,2}}{\\lambda_{max,em,1}}$, we have:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the temperature ratio.**\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $\\frac{v_{r,2}}{c} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{7}{3000}$\n*   $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 7/3000} = \\frac{3000}{3007}$\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final luminosity ratio.**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the equation from Step 4:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{3000}{3007})^4$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$(\\frac{3000}{3007}) \\approx 0.997672$\n$(\\frac{3000}{3007})^4 \\approx (0.997672)^4 \\approx 0.99072$\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.99072 \\approx 2.2291$\n\n**Step 8: Match the result to the given options.**\nThe calculated ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to 2.23. This matches option B.\n\n**Careful Point Summary:**\n*   Ignoring the Doppler effect would incorrectly assume $T_1 = T_2$, leading to an answer of 2.25 (Option C). This is a common trap.\n*   The mass information is irrelevant for this specific calculation method, which is based on fundamental radiation laws.\n*   The term \"appeared brightest\" must be interpreted as the observed property, not the intrinsic emitted property.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700 \\text{ km/s}}{300000 \\text{ km/s}}}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.002333...}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{1.009355...} \\approx 2.229$\n\n<<<B>>>"
