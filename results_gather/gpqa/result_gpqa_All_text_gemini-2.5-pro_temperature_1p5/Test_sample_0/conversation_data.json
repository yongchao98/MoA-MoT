    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Physical Principle\n\nThe problem involves the lifetime of quantum states and the ability to distinguish their energy levels. This is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. The principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can know both the energy of a particle and the time for which it has that energy.\n\nThe mathematical relationship is:\n**ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy. For an unstable state, this can be interpreted as the \"width\" or \"spread\" of the energy level. It's not a perfectly sharp value.\n*   **Δt** is the uncertainty in time. For an unstable state, this is taken to be its lifetime (τ).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nFor practical calculations and estimations, we often use the approximation:\n**ΔE ≈ ħ / τ**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** A shorter lifetime (τ) leads to a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE). A longer lifetime leads to a smaller energy uncertainty (a \"sharper\" energy level).\n2.  **Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly resolve\" or \"distinguish\" two energy levels, the separation between their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their individual energy widths. At a minimum, the separation must be larger than the width of the *broader* energy level.\n3.  **Identify the Broader Level:** The broader energy level is the one with the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE). According to the uncertainty principle, this corresponds to the state with the **shorter lifetime**.\n4.  **Consistent Units:** The lifetimes are given in seconds, and the options for energy difference are in electron-volts (eV). We must use a value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) that is consistent with these units. The most convenient value to use is:\n    *   **ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s**\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n\n2.  **Identify the state with the shorter lifetime.**\n    *   τ₁ (10⁻⁹ s) is shorter than τ₂ (10⁻⁸ s).\n    *   Therefore, state 1 will have the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) and will be the broader energy level. This broader width will be the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy width (ΔE₁) of the broader state (state 1).**\n    *   Using the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ:\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **(Optional) Calculate the energy width of the other state (state 2).**\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   As expected, ΔE₁ > ΔE₂.\n\n5.  **Apply the condition for resolution.**\n    *   To clearly resolve the two levels, their energy separation |E₁ - E₂| must be larger than the width of the broader level, ΔE₁.\n    *   Required condition: **|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁**\n    *   Required condition: **|E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n6.  **Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁸ eV:** Is 10⁻⁸ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No. The separation is smaller than the width. The levels would overlap too much.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** Is 10⁻⁹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** Is 10⁻¹¹ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁴ eV:** Is 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV? Yes. (Since 10⁻⁴ is 1000 x 10⁻⁷, it is much larger). This separation is significantly larger than the energy width of the broader state, so the two levels could be clearly distinguished.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe minimum energy difference required to resolve the levels is determined by the natural energy width of the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s), which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The energy difference must be greater than this value. Out of the given options, only 10⁻⁴ eV satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<D>>>"
