    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model:**\n    The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This system is radiating electromagnetic waves. In electromagnetism, any radiating source can be described by a multipole expansion. The lowest-order (and typically dominant) term in this expansion for a source whose size is small compared to the wavelength is the electric dipole term. The described system—a charge distribution oscillating along a symmetry axis—naturally gives rise to an oscillating electric dipole moment, `**p** = p₀ cos(ωt) **ẑ**`. We will therefore model the source as an ideal oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Radiated Power:**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the Larmor formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C(ω) sin²(θ)`\n    where:\n    *   `θ` is the polar angle between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\n    *   `C(ω)` is a term that depends on the angular frequency `ω` of oscillation and the amplitude of the dipole moment `p₀`, but is independent of the angle `θ`.\n    The problem defines this quantity as `f(λ, θ)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Angular Dependence and Find the Maximum Power (A):**\n    The function `f(λ, θ)` is proportional to `sin²(θ)`. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` occurs when `sin(θ) = 1`, which is at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is given as `A`.\n    `A = f_max = (dP/dΩ)_max = C(ω) * sin²(90°) = C(ω) * (1)² = C(ω)`.\n    So, the coefficient `C(ω)` is the maximum power `A`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction of Power at θ = 30°:**\n    We need to find the value of `f` at `θ = 30°` and express it as a fraction of the maximum power `A`.\n    *   Power at `θ = 30°`: `f(λ, 30°) = C(ω) * sin²(30°) = A * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `f(λ, 30°) = A * (1/2)² = A/4`.\n    *   The fraction of `A` radiated at this angle is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence of the Power Function `f`:**\n    Now we need to find how `f` (or equivalently `A = C(ω)`) depends on the wavelength `λ`. The full expression for `C(ω)` is:\n    `C(ω) = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π² ε₀ c³)`\n    This shows that the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`.\n    The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    Thus, a possible form for the function `f` includes a factor of `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Model Choice:** The key assumption is that the source is well-approximated by an electric dipole. This is the most fundamental mode of radiation and is dominant unless suppressed by symmetry. An oscillating charge distribution with a defined axis strongly suggests a dipole model. A higher-order model like a quadrupole (which would lead to answer A) is less likely without explicit information suggesting the dipole moment is zero.\n*   **Radiation Zone:** The problem specifies the \"radiation zone\" (or far-field), which is where the standard `sin²(θ)` radiation pattern and `1/r²` power flux dependence are valid.\n*   **Angular Function:** The power depends on `sin²(θ)`, not `sin(θ)`. This is a common point of error. The maximum power is radiated perpendicular to the dipole (`θ=90°`), and zero power is radiated along the dipole axis (`θ=0°` and `θ=180°`).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nB) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\nC) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nD) 1/4, λ⁻³\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
