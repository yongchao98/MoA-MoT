    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Given Information**\n*   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n*   Ratio of masses: M1 / M2 ≈ 1.15 (This is extra information, see Careful Point 1)\n*   Ratio of masses: M2 / M3 ≈ 1.35 (This is extra information, see Careful Point 1)\n*   Albedo for all three planets: A = 0.3 (The specific value is not needed, only that it's constant, see Careful Point 2)\n*   The orbits are circular.\n\n**Step 3: Establish the Relationship Between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space.\n*   The power absorbed by a planet is proportional to (1 - A) / r², where 'A' is the albedo and 'r' is the orbital radius.\n*   The power radiated by a planet is proportional to T_eq⁴, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   Equating the absorbed and radiated power gives: T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / r².\n*   Since the albedo 'A' is the same for all three planets, the (1 - A) term is a constant factor that cancels out when we take ratios.\n*   Therefore, the relationship simplifies to: T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / r².\n*   Taking the fourth root of both sides gives: T_eq ∝ 1 / r^(2/4) = 1 / r^(1/2) = 1 / √r.\n*   Rearranging this to solve for the orbital radius 'r', we get: r ∝ 1 / T_eq².\n\n**Step 4: Establish the Relationship Between Orbital Period and Orbital Radius**\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, for planets orbiting the same central star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius (r).\n*   P² ∝ r³\n*   Taking the square root of both sides gives: P ∝ r^(3/2).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Relationships to Connect Period and Temperature**\nWe want to find the ratio P3 / P1.\n*   From Step 4, we know P3 / P1 = (r3 / r1)^(3/2).\n*   From Step 3, we know r ∝ 1 / T_eq². Therefore, the ratio of radii is r3 / r1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)². (Note the inversion of the indices).\n*   Now, substitute the expression for the radius ratio into the period ratio equation:\n    P3 / P1 = [(T_eq1 / T_eq3)²]^(3/2)\n*   Simplifying the exponents ( (x²)⁽³/²⁾ = x³ ), we get:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Numerical Value**\nFirst, we need to find the overall temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3.\n*   We can find this by multiplying the given temperature ratios:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\n*   Substituting the given values:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n*   Now, use this value to calculate the period ratio:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³ ≈ (3.22)³\n*   (3.22)³ = 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22 ≈ 10.3684 * 3.22 ≈ 33.386...\n*   This value is approximately 33.4.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Planet Masses:** The masses of the planets are not required for this calculation. Kepler's Third Law in the form P² ∝ r³ assumes the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard and valid assumption in nearly all exoplanet systems. The mass information is extraneous.\n2.  **Albedo Value:** The specific value of the albedo (0.3) is also not necessary. The crucial piece of information is that the albedo is the *same* for all three planets. This allows the (1 - A) term to cancel out when we form the ratio of temperatures and radii.\n3.  **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to use the correct exponents in the relationships: r ∝ 1/T_eq² and P ∝ r^(3/2). A mistake in these exponents will lead to a completely different result.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe analysis shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
