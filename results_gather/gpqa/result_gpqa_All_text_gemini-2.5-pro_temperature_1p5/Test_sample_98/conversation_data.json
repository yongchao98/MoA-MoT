    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is due to the varying strengths of these bonds.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group present but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data (General)**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their absence confirms that the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds). All four options are saturated molecules, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data (Splitting Patterns)**\n\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis. We need to find the structure that contains a proton with a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) multiplicity and another proton with a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) multiplicity.\n\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and another different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each option. The condensed formulas need careful interpretation. Let's assume they describe a main chain with substituents.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's interpret this formula as a chain: `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH` group connected to a `CH(C₂H₅)` group, which is connected to a `CH₂COOH` group.\nLet's draw this out:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C(a))\n      |\n  CH₃--CH(a)--CH(b)--CH₂--COOH\n                 |\n                 CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C(b))\n```\nTo understand the splitting, we first need to identify the longest carbon chain that includes the COOH group.\nThe longest chain is: `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(b)(3)-CH(a)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nThis makes the molecule **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\nNow let's analyze the splitting for the two methine protons, H(a) and H(b).\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The two protons on C2 (`-CH₂-COOH`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  The one proton on C4 (H(a)): `n=1`, gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The two protons on its own ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(a) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The two protons on C5 (`-CH₂CH₃`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  The one proton on C3 (H(b)): `n=1`, gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The three protons of the methyl group on C4: `n=3`, gives a **quartet**.\n    Therefore, the signal for H(a) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\nSince this structure has both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal, it is a very strong candidate.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n\nThis is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C3 and C4.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C4 (d), CH₃ on C3 (q), and CH₂ on C2 (t). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**.\n*   **Proton at C4:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the two CH₃ groups on C4 and C5 (which are equivalent due to being part of an isopropyl group, `n=6`). This gives a **doublet of septets**.\nThis molecule has a `dqt` signal, but it does not have a `dtt` signal. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n\nThis is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C2 and C3.\n*   **Proton at C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (d), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t), and the CH₂ on C4 (t). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\nThis molecule has a `dtt` signal, but it does not have a `dtq` signal. So, C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n\nThis is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C2 and C3.\n*   **Proton at C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the CH₃ on C2 (q). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (d), the CH₃ on C3 (q), and the CH₂ on C4 (t). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**.\nThis molecule has a `dqt` signal, but it does not have a `dtt` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` signal and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
