    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting materials and the product.**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's break down this name:\n    *   \"pyran\" indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n    *   \"tetrahydro\" means the ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n    *   \"2-one\" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 2 of the ring.\n    *   This structure is a δ-lactone (a cyclic ester with a six-membered ring).\n    *   \"4-ethyl\" indicates an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 4.\n    *   The numbering for the pyranone ring starts with the ring oxygen as position 1, and the carbonyl carbon as position 2.\n    *   The carbon at position 4 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, an ethyl group, a -CH₂-C=O group (part of the ring), and a -CH₂-CH₂-O- group (part of the ring).\n*   **Lactone Formation:** A δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The specific precursor for 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH\n    *   When this molecule cyclizes, the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxyl group at C1. The C3 of the acid chain (which has the ethyl group) becomes the C4 of the lactone ring. The stereochemistry at this carbon is preserved during lactonization.\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options provide isomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine its structure.\n    *   This name describes a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5). The chiral center is at C3.\n    *   The goal of both reactions is to transform this starting material into 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which then cyclizes to the product lactone. This requires the selective reduction of the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters and ketones in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (-COO-iBu) at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The H⁺ workup quenches the reaction and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence does not involve breaking any bonds at the chiral C3 center. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The (R/S) configuration of the starting material A at C3 will be the same as the (R/S) configuration of the product lactone at C4.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the (R)-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is a strong reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Careful Point - The \"Trick\" in the Question:** If BH₃ followed its standard selectivity, it would reduce the -COOH group at C1 to -CH₂OH, leaving the ester at C5 intact. The resulting molecule (an ester of a 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid derivative) would cyclize to form a 7-membered lactone (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered lactone (δ-lactone) specified in the product.\n*   **Correct Mechanism for this Substrate:** For dicarboxylic acid monoesters like glutaric acid derivatives, borane exhibits an unusual selectivity. The carboxylic acid first reacts with BH₃ to form an acyloxyborane intermediate (R-COO-BH₂). This intermediate then forms a stable six-membered ring by chelating with the carbonyl oxygen of the nearby ester group. This chelation activates the *ester* carbonyl, directing a second molecule of BH₃ to reduce the ester group instead of the acyloxyborane.\n*   **Mechanism Summary:**\n    1.  Despite the usual selectivity of BH₃, in this specific case, an intramolecular chelate directs the reduction to the ester group.\n    2.  The net result is the same as with LiBH₄: the ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the carboxylic acid at C1 is preserved (regenerated during H⁺ workup).\n    3.  The intermediate is again 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  Lactonization under acidic conditions yields the δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This mechanism also does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is the (S)-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n*   This corresponds to the option where:\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nLet's match this to the given options.\nOption D matches our findings.\n\n<<<D>>>"
