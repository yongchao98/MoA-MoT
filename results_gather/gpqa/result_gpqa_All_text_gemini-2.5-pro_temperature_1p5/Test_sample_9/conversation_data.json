    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of density.**\nDensity (ρ) is a measure of how much mass (m) is contained in a given unit volume (V). The formula is:\nρ = m / V\nFor a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the planet's radius.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the principle of planetary compression.**\nA crucial point to understand for this question is that planets are not perfectly rigid. The material they are made of gets compressed by the planet's own gravity. A more massive planet has stronger gravity, which pulls its material more tightly together. This effect is called gravitational compression. Therefore, for two planets made of the exact same materials (same composition), the more massive planet will be more compressed and will have a higher average density.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each option based on this principle.**\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This option describes a planet identical to Earth. We will use it as our baseline.\n    *   Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_Earth.\n    *   Density of planet (a) = ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    *   The density is explicitly stated in the question.\n    *   Density of planet (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³, which is approximately ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   This planet is made of the same materials as Earth, but it is much more massive (5 M_Earth).\n    *   Due to its significantly greater mass, its self-gravity will be much stronger, causing a high degree of gravitational compression.\n    *   This compression means its volume will not increase proportionally to its mass. The planet will be smaller than it would be without this compression, leading to a higher overall density.\n    *   Therefore, the density of planet (c) will be significantly greater than ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   This planet is made of the same materials as Earth but is less massive (0.5 M_Earth).\n    *   Its self-gravity will be weaker than Earth's.\n    *   This means the material will be less compressed compared to Earth.\n    *   Therefore, the density of planet (d) will be lower than ρ_Earth.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the densities.**\n\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.5 g/cm³ (due to high gravitational compression)\n*   Density (d) < 5.5 g/cm³ (due to low gravitational compression)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four options, the planet described in (c) is the only one with a density guaranteed to be higher than Earth's. It is more massive than the other planets while having a composition that gets denser under pressure. Therefore, it has the highest density.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Composition vs. Density:** Don't confuse having a high mass with having a high density. A large gas giant can be very massive but have a very low density. The key in options (c) and (d) is the phrase \"same composition as Earth,\" which means we are comparing rocky bodies where compression is the dominant factor in density differences.\n*   **Explicit vs. Inferred Properties:** Option (b) gives an explicit density, which we must use. We don't infer its density from its mass, as its composition is not specified. We infer the densities for (c) and (d) based on their mass and specified Earth-like composition.\n*   **Gravitational Compression:** This physical principle is central to solving the problem correctly. For bodies of the same composition, density increases with mass.\n\n<<<A>>>"
