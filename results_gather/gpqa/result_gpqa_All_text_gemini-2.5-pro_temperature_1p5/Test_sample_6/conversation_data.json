    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray photon ($\\gamma$) with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). The reaction is:\n    $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    For this reaction to be possible, both energy and momentum must be conserved. In special relativity, this is conveniently handled by the conservation of the total four-momentum. The threshold energy is the minimum energy the incoming high-energy photon must have for the reaction to occur.\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Invariants:**\n    The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant quantity, meaning it has the same value in all inertial reference frames. We can calculate $s$ before and after the collision and set them equal.\n    *   Let the four-momentum of the high-energy photon be $p_1 = (E_{\\gamma}, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$.\n    *   Let the four-momentum of the CMB photon be $p_2 = (E_{CMB}, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$.\n    *   Let the four-momenta of the electron and positron be $p_{e^{-}}$ and $p_{e^{+}}$.\n\n    The conservation of four-momentum states: $p_1 + p_2 = p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}}$.\n    Squaring both sides gives the invariant $s$:\n    $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = (p_{e^{-}} + p_{e^{+}})^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant 's' for the Initial State (Two Photons):**\n    $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2 = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2$.\n    *   For any massless particle like a photon, the square of its four-momentum is zero ($p^2 = E^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 c^2 = 0$, or just $p^2=0$ in natural units where c=1). Thus, $p_1^2 = 0$ and $p_2^2 = 0$.\n    *   The expression simplifies to $s = 2 p_1 \\cdot p_2$.\n    *   The dot product is $p_1 \\cdot p_2 = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    *   Since for photons, energy $E$ equals the magnitude of momentum $|\\vec{p}|$ (in units where c=1), this becomes: $s = 2 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Invariant 's' for the Final State (Electron-Positron Pair) at Threshold:**\n    The threshold condition corresponds to the minimum energy required to create the final particles. In the center-of-mass frame of the collision, this minimum energy occurs when the electron and positron are created at rest.\n    *   The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is $E_{CM} = \\sqrt{s}$.\n    *   At threshold, the energy is just the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron: $E_{CM, min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    *   Therefore, the invariant $s$ at threshold is $s_{threshold} = (E_{CM, min})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^4$.\n\n6.  **Equate and Solve for the Threshold Energy:**\n    Now we set the two expressions for $s$ equal at the threshold:\n    $2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4m_e^2 c^4$\n\n    To find the *minimum* required energy for the gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma}$, we need to consider the most efficient collision scenario. The left side is maximized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This happens for a head-on collision, where the photons travel towards each other ($\\theta = \\pi$ or 180Â°), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$.\n    *   For a head-on collision: $2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (1 - (-1)) = 4m_e^2 c^4$.\n    *   $2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (2) = 4m_e^2 c^4$.\n    *   $4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} = 4m_e^2 c^4$.\n    *   $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$.\n\n7.  **Plug in the Numerical Values:**\n    *   The rest energy of an electron is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    To compare with the options, we convert this energy to GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$):\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15}}{10^9} \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The problem involves a high-energy particle, so relativistic kinematics (four-vectors and Lorentz invariants) are essential.\n*   **Threshold Condition:** The key is to correctly identify the threshold condition: in the center-of-mass frame, the final products are created at rest.\n*   **Collision Geometry:** The lowest threshold energy occurs for a head-on collision ($\\theta=180^\\circ$). The question asks \"From what energy...\", implying we should find this minimum energy at which the process becomes possible.\n*   **Data and Constants:** Use the provided value for CMB photon energy ($10^{-3}$ eV) and the standard value for the electron rest mass energy ($0.511$ MeV).\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Be careful when converting between eV, MeV, and GeV.\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
