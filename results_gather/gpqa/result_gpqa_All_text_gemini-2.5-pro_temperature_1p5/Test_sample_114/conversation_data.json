    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the angle between the two photons.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThis problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation. The key principles to solve it are:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum (which is a vector) of the system before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision.\n*   **Relativistic Formulas:** We will use the formulas for relativistic energy and momentum.\n    *   Relativistic energy: `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Relationship between energy and momentum: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    *   For photons (massless particles): `E = pc`.\n\n**2. List the Given Information and Define the System**\n*   **Electron (e⁻):** Moves left to right (positive x-direction). Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`. Rest mass is `m_e`.\n*   **Positron (e⁺):** Moves right to left (negative x-direction). Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. Rest mass `m_p = m_e`.\n*   **Collision Outcome:** Two photons (γ) of equal energy. Let the energy of each photon be `E_γ`.\n*   **Photon Directions:** One \"upper-right\" and one \"lower-right\". This implies they have opposite vertical (y-component) momenta.\n*   **Goal:** Find the total angle `θ_total` between the directions of the two photons.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron.\n*   Energy of the electron: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`\n*   Energy of the positron: `E_p = γ_p * m_p * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`\n*   Total initial energy: `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6m_e c²`\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy of the Final Photons**\nBy conservation of energy, the total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n*   `E_final = E_initial = 6m_e c²`\n*   The final state consists of two photons with equal energy `E_γ`.\n*   `E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`\n*   Therefore, `2 * E_γ = 6m_e c²`, which means the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3m_e c²`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\nMomentum is a vector, so we need to consider its direction. Let the horizontal axis be the x-axis.\n*   The momentum `p` of a particle can be found using `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, which rearranges to `p = (1/c) * sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) = mc * sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n*   Momentum of the electron (positive x-direction): `p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(γ_e² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(4² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)`\n*   Momentum of the positron (negative x-direction): `p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(γ_p² - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(2² - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(3)`\n*   Total initial momentum (only in the x-direction): `P_initial_x = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`\n*   Total initial momentum in the y-direction is zero: `P_initial_y = 0`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Momentum**\nThe final state consists of two photons. Let's analyze their momenta.\n*   For a photon, `E = pc`, so the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3m_e c²) / c = 3m_e c`.\n*   Let the first photon travel at an angle `θ` with the x-axis (\"upper-right\"), and the second photon travel at an angle `φ` (\"lower-right\").\n*   **Conservation of y-momentum:** `P_final_y = P_initial_y = 0`.\n    *   `P_final_y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(φ) = 0`\n    *   `sin(θ) = -sin(φ)`, which means `φ = -θ`. This confirms that the photons emerge at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis.\n*   **Conservation of x-momentum:** `P_final_x = P_initial_x`.\n    *   `P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n\n**7. Solve for the Angle**\nNow we equate the initial and final x-momenta.\n*   `P_initial_x = P_final_x`\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n*   Substitute the value we found for `p_γ = 3m_e c`:\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3m_e c) * cos(θ)`\n*   Divide both sides by `m_e * c`:\n*   `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n*   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n*   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n*   Now, calculate the numerical value:\n*   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n*   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n*   Find `θ` by taking the inverse cosine:\n*   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\n**8. Find the Total Angle Between the Photons**\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the two photons.\n*   Photon 1 is at an angle `θ ≈ 69.1°`.\n*   Photon 2 is at an angle `-θ ≈ -69.1°`.\n*   The total angle between them is `θ_total = θ - (-θ) = 2θ`.\n*   `θ_total = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the closest answer is 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
