    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, X is the number of halogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11 / 2) - (0 / 2) + (1 / 2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) or secondary amide (-CONH-) would only show one band, and a primary amide (-CONH2) would also show two bands but they often differ in shape and are coupled with a strong amide C=O stretch at a lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester (an ester attached to a double bond or aromatic ring), which usually appears around 1730-1715 cm-1.\n    *   It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is typically < 1700 cm-1).\n    *   It is generally too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, e.g., R-COO-Ph), which is typically > 1750 cm-1.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons, i.e., a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is part of an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons, i.e., a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is very downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, specifically in an ester (-COO**CH2**-).\n*   **Combined Analysis of 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals:** These two signals together conclusively identify an **ethyl ester** fragment, specifically the -CO**O-CH2-CH3** part.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7-8 ppm):** This region is characteristic of aromatic protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** This means the benzene ring is di-substituted.\n    *   **Splitting (two doublets):** This simple A2B2 (or AA'BB') pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring must be different electronically. One is an electron-donating group (EDG) and the other is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). The protons ortho to the EWG are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm), and the protons ortho to the EDG are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH, -COOH, or -NH groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH2** group. An amine group is an EDG.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nFrom our analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine (-NH2) group (an EDG) attached to the ring.\n3.  An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group (an EWG) attached to the ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together in a para arrangement gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester. The IR and NMR aromatic patterns do not match.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Perfect Match.**\n    *   Formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n    *   Has a primary amine (-NH2), matching the IR.\n    *   Has a conjugated ethyl ester, matching the C=O at 1720 cm-1 and the ethyl group signals in the NMR (quartet at ~4.5 ppm).\n    *   Is para-disubstituted, matching the two-doublet pattern in the NMR. The -NH2 is the EDG (protons ortho to it are upfield at 7.0 ppm) and -COOEt is the EWG (protons ortho to it are downfield at 8.0 ppm).\n    *   The -NH2 protons appear as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (shows a primary amine) and NMR (-NH- would be 1H, not 2H; a formyl proton -CHO would be present).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The structure is CH3CH2COO-Ph-NH2. This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The C=O stretch would be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm-1). In the NMR, the quartet would be from a -CO-CH2- group and appear around 2.5 ppm, not the observed 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll spectroscopic data points unambiguously to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
