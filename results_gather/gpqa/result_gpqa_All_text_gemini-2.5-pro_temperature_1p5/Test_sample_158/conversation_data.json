    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the physical phenomenon:** The question describes a quasar spectrum with a peak at 790 nm and a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line** from the quasar, with the flux drop being caused by the **Lyman-alpha forest** and/or the **Gunn-Peterson trough**. The intergalactic medium, filled with neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts between us and the quasar, absorbs light at wavelengths shorter than the quasar's redshifted Lyα line. Therefore, the observed peak at 790 nm corresponds to the Lyα line emitted by the quasar.\n\n2.  **Calculate the redshift (z):** The redshift `z` relates the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the rest-frame emitted wavelength (λ_em).\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is λ_em ≈ 121.6 nm.\n    *   The observed wavelength is λ_obs = 790 nm.\n    *   The formula for redshift is: 1 + z = λ_obs / λ_em\n    *   Plugging in the values: 1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.497\n    *   Therefore, the redshift of the quasar is z ≈ 5.5.\n\n3.  **Determine the formula for comoving distance:** The comoving distance (D_c) is the proper distance between two points at the present cosmological time (scale factor a=1). For a flat universe (as stated, since Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1.0), the comoving distance to an object at redshift `z` is given by the integral:\n    *   D_c = D_H * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n    *   where:\n        *   D_H is the Hubble distance, D_H = c / H₀.\n        *   `c` is the speed of light.\n        *   H₀ is the Hubble constant.\n        *   E(z') is the dimensionless Hubble parameter: E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m,0 * (1+z')³ + Ω_Λ,0)\n\n4.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   **Hubble constant:** H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   **Speed of light:** c ≈ 3 x 10⁵ km s⁻¹\n    *   **Matter density:** Ω_m,0 = 0.3\n    *   **Dark energy density:** Ω_Λ,0 = 0.7\n    *   **Redshift:** z = 5.5\n\n    *   First, calculate the Hubble distance:\n        D_H = c / H₀ = (3 x 10⁵ km/s) / (70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹) ≈ 4286 Mpc or 4.286 Gpc.\n\n    *   Next, set up the integral for D_c:\n        D_c = 4286 Mpc * ∫[from 0 to 5.5] dz' / sqrt(0.3 * (1+z')³ + 0.7)\n\n    *   This integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be evaluated numerically. The value of the integral is approximately 2.084.\n\n    *   Finally, calculate the comoving distance:\n        D_c ≈ 4286 Mpc * 2.084\n        D_c ≈ 8932 Mpc\n\n5.  **Convert to Gpc and choose the answer:**\n    *   D_c ≈ 8.932 Gpc.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        A) 8 Gpc\n        B) 7 Gpc\n        C) 9 Gpc\n        D) 6 Gpc\n    *   The calculated value of ~8.93 Gpc is closest to 9 Gpc.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Identifying the Line:** The most crucial step is correctly identifying the 790 nm peak as the redshifted Lyman-alpha line based on the description of the flux drop at shorter wavelengths. Mistaking it for another line (like H-alpha at 656.3 nm) would lead to a completely different redshift and distance.\n*   **Correct Formula:** Using the correct formula for comoving distance in a flat ΛCDM universe is essential. The formula changes for open or closed universes.\n*   **Numerical Integration:** Recognizing that the integral requires numerical computation is key to getting an accurate answer rather than a rough approximation.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All units must be consistent throughout the calculation (e.g., using km/s for `c` and km/s/Mpc for H₀) to arrive at a distance in Mpc.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the comoving distance is approximately 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
