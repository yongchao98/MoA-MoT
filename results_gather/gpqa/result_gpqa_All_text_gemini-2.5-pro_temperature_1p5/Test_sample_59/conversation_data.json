    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves a spacecraft traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light (`c`). According to Albert Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, time passes differently for an observer in a fast-moving reference frame compared to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called **time dilation**. The time experienced by the moving person (the astronaut) will be shorter than the time measured by a stationary observer (on Earth).\n\n*   **`Δt_0`**: This is the \"proper time,\" the time measured in the moving frame of reference (the astronaut's clock). This is what the question asks for.\n*   **`Δt`**: This is the time measured in the stationary frame of reference (clocks on Earth).\n\n**2. Identify Given Information and Necessary Constants**\n\n*   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** `v = 0.99999987 * c`\n*   **Astronaut's initial age:** 22 years\n*   **Alien's average lifetime:** 150 years\n*   **Destination:** Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud**\nThe problem does not explicitly state the distance. We need to use a standard astronomical value. The distance to the LMC is commonly cited as being between 159,000 and 163,000 light-years. For physics problems of this nature, a specific value is often intended to produce a clean answer. Let's use **159,000 light-years** as our working distance (`D`), as it is a well-established value.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the time of the journey in Earth's reference frame (`Δt`).**\n\nThis is the time it would take as measured by an observer on Earth. We use the simple formula: `time = distance / speed`.\n\n*   `Δt = D / v`\n*   `Δt = 159,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)`\n\nSince one light-year is the distance light travels in one year (`1 ly = c * 1 year`), the `c` terms cancel out.\n\n*   `Δt = 159,000 years / 0.99999987`\n*   `Δt ≈ 159,000.02` years\n\nFor simplicity, we can approximate this to **159,000 years**. The spacecraft is moving so close to the speed of light that the travel time in Earth's frame is almost identical to the distance in light-years.\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`).**\n\nThe Lorentz factor `γ` (gamma) quantifies the effect of time dilation. It is calculated using the formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculating `γ` with High Precision**\nSince `v` is extremely close to `c`, `v²/c²` is very close to 1, and `1 - v²/c²` is a very small number. A standard calculator might have precision issues. We can simplify the calculation:\n\n*   Let `β = v/c = 0.99999987`\n*   `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt((1 - β)(1 + β))`\n*   `1 - β = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013 = 1.3 x 10⁻⁷`\n*   `1 + β = 1 + 0.99999987 ≈ 2`\n*   `γ ≈ 1 / sqrt((1.3 x 10⁻⁷) * 2) = 1 / sqrt(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)`\n*   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099`\n*   `γ ≈ 1961.17`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (`Δt_0`).**\n\nThe time dilation formula connects the two timeframes: `Δt = γ * Δt_0`. We need to solve for `Δt_0`, the time on the astronaut's clock.\n\n*   `Δt_0 = Δt / γ`\n*   `Δt_0 = 159,000 years / 1961.17`\n*   `Δt_0 ≈ 81.07` years\n\nThis result is extremely close to **81 years**.\n\n**4. Final Analysis and Conclusion**\n\n*   The journey will take approximately **81 years** from the astronaut's point of view.\n*   The astronaut starts at 22 years old.\n*   Their age upon arrival on Earth would be: `22 + 81 = 103` years.\n*   The average lifespan for their species is 150 years.\n*   Since `103 < 150`, the astronaut will survive the journey. This rules out option A.\n*   The calculated time of 81 years matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
