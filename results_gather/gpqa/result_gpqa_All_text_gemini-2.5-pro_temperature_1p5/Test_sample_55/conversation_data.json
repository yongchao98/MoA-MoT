    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Process and Identify the States\nThe problem describes the decay of a Hydrogen atom from an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to a final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs not directly, but \"via two dipole transition\". This implies a cascade process: a sequence of two electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n*   **Initial State ($|i\\rangle$):** $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state).\n*   **Final State ($|f\\rangle$):** $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the ground state, 1s).\n*   **Intermediate State ($|k\\rangle$):** We need to determine the quantum numbers $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ of this state.\n\nThe process is: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{Dipole 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions\nFor a transition to be allowed under the electric dipole approximation, the following selection rules must be met:\n1.  The parity must change. The parity of a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ is given by $(-1)^l$. A change in parity means $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$ must be an odd integer.\n2.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n4.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$). For a decay (photon emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$\nLet's apply the selection rules to find the possible intermediate states $|k\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta l$:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta n$:** The atom decays, so energy decreases. Thus, $n' < n=3$. The problem options suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is allowed. Any other $n'$ is not mentioned in the options. So we consider $n'=2$.\n*   **Rule for $\\Delta m$:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $0, +1, -1$.\n\nCombining these, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   $|2,1,0\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,1\\rangle$\n*   $|2,1,-1\\rangle$\nThese correspond to the three degenerate substates of the 2p orbital.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\nLet's check if the second step is allowed for each of the possible intermediate states.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,1\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n*   **For intermediate state $|2,1,-1\\rangle$:**\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$ (Allowed).\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$ (Allowed).\n    *   This transition is allowed. The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible.\n\nAll three routes suggested by the selection rules are physically possible.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability of the Transition Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this corresponds to the branching ratio of the first transition, assuming the intermediate state decays with 100% probability to the final state (which is true here, as the only dipole-allowed decay from 2p is to 1s).\n\nThe probability of the route via $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is given by:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the transition rate.\n\nThe transition rate $\\Gamma(i \\to f)$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n$\\Gamma(i \\to f) \\propto |\\langle f | e\\vec{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = e^2 (|\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2)$\n\nLet's evaluate the rates for the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Initial State:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric.\n*   **Final States:** The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields).\n\nA key principle of quantum mechanics (related to the Wigner-Eckart theorem) states that for a transition from a spherically symmetric state ($l=0$) to a set of degenerate states, the transition rate to each of these final states is equal. This is because there is no preferred direction in space for the spherically symmetric initial state.\n\nTherefore, the rates must be equal:\n$\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle)$\n\nLet's call this common rate $\\Gamma_0$. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ manifold is the sum of the individual rates:\n$\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0 = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n$P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$, and the probability for the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $1/3$.\n\n### Step 6: Compare with the Given Options\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    This option presents a valid route and the calculated probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability should be $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    The route is valid, but the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, not $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only option that is consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics for dipole transitions is option A. The specific route is allowed by the selection rules, and the probability of this specific channel, among the three equally likely channels, is exactly $1/3$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
