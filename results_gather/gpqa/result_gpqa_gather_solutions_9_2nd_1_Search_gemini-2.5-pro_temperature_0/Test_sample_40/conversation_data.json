The correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **S' (Glass Frame):** This is the frame moving with the glass at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Identify Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'). The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). The problem states `c=1`, so `n = 1 / u'`. This gives `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute Known Values:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To simplify this complex fraction, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Addition:** It is essential to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The classical (Galilean) addition `u = u' + v` would give an incorrect result.\n*   **Defining `u'`:** The speed of light *in the medium's rest frame* is `c/n`. Since `c=1`, this is `1/n`. This is the `u'` in the formula.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The simplification of the complex fraction `(1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)` is a critical step. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` is the most direct way to get the final form.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** After deriving the correct expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, it must be carefully matched with the given options. Many of the provided answers correctly derived the formula but failed at this final step.\n\nThe derived expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light in a moving medium as seen by a stationary observer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the stationary frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **S' (Glass Frame):** This is the frame of reference that is moving along with the glass.

The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). The problem states to take `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: This is the velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the value we need to calculate.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    For combining velocities in special relativity, we must use Einstein's velocity addition formula. Since the glass and the light beam are moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values `u' = 1/n`, `v = v`, and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To remove the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply the entire expression's numerator and denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*(1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Comparing this result with the options provided:\n    A) 1\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\n    The derived expression exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity, often associated with the Fizeau experiment.
