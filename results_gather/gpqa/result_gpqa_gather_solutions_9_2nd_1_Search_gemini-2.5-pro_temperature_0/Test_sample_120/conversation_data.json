Analyze the Reaction Principles**\n\nThe problem describes the reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate (Me₂CuLi). The key principles are provided:\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (in this case, a methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a secondary carbon center.\n*   The secondary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the tertiary carbon (C1).\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution**\n\n*   The attack on C6 adds a methyl group to that position.\n*   The epoxide ring opens, and after a standard aqueous workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. To name it, we follow IUPAC rules:\n    *   The carbon with the -OH group is the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now the new C2) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The product's constitutional name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the deciding step between options B and C.\n*   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 was (R) → Product C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was (R) → Product C5 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was (R) → Product C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an inversion of configuration.\n    *   Original C6 was **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack causes a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out).\n    *   **Crucial Point:** We must determine if this geometric inversion from (S) results in an (R) or (S) descriptor in the product. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which have changed.\n        *   **At C6 (reactant):** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H.\n        *   **At C2 (product, from C6):** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The leaving group (O, priority 1) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3).\n    *   A detailed analysis of the 3D structure and the new CIP priorities shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new center at C2 with an **(S)** configuration. The change in substituent priorities means the R/S descriptor does not flip in this specific case, even though the geometry inverts.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the stereochemical results:\n*   C1 is **(R)**\n*   C2 is **(S)**\n*   C4 is **(R)**\n*   C5 is **(R)**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It is substituted with methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which serves as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt provides the key rules for this specific reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The first rule given is that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A carbon bonded to a methyl group is significantly more sterically hindered than one bonded to a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack of a methyl group at C6 and the subsequent opening of the epoxide ring (with workup) results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product, IUPAC rules dictate that the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (the newly added one on original C6), 4, and 5. This locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The constitutional name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol). The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The second rule given is that **inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added**. This is the defining characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly attacked (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n*   Let's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product:\n    *   **C1:** The configuration is retained. It was (R) and remains **(R)**.\n    *   **C3:** The configuration is retained. It was (R). In the new numbering system, this carbon is C5, so its configuration is **(5R)**.\n    *   **C4:** The configuration is retained. It was (R) and remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **C6:** This is the site of attack. The configuration is inverted. It was (S), so after inversion, it becomes **(R)**. In the new numbering system, this carbon is C2, so its configuration is **(2R)**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemical analysis, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Comparing this to the remaining options:\n    *   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   The derived product matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction and Reactants**\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, by an organocuprate reagent, Me₂CuLi.\n*   **Key Principles:** The problem provides two crucial rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methyl group) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, and a subsequent workup (standard procedure) forms a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original three at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** The carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered such that the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), implying an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful analysis.\n*   **Retention:** The stereocenters not involved in the attack (C1, C3, C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 was (R) → Product C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was (R) → Product C5 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was (R) → Product C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Inversion:** The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an inversion of configuration. The original configuration was **(6S)**.\n*   **The Pitfall:** Simply flipping 'S' to 'R' is a common shortcut, but it is only valid if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents do not change significantly. In this case, they do:\n    *   At reactant C6, the leaving group (epoxide oxygen) is the highest priority substituent.\n    *   At product C2 (the new name for the attacked carbon), the incoming methyl group has a lower priority than the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   **Correct Analysis:** We must consider the actual geometric inversion (a Walden inversion) and then re-assign the configuration using CIP rules. A detailed analysis (as performed correctly by agents 4, 9, and 10) shows that the geometric inversion at the (6S) center results in a product center with an **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reaction type.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The problem states a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that carbon. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest locants to the methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1, C2 (from the original C6), C4 (from the original C4), and C5 (from the original C3).\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol), which would arise from an attack at C1. The choice is between A and B.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The problem states another key rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The configurations of the stereocenters not involved in the attack (C1, C3, C4) are **retained**.\n*   The configuration of the stereocenter that is attacked (C6) is **inverted**.\n\nLet's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product:\n*   **New C1 (from original C1):** Configuration is retained. It was (1R), so it remains **(1R)**.\n*   **New C4 (from original C4):** Configuration is retained. It was (4R), so it remains **(4R)**.\n*   **New C5 (from original C3):** Configuration is retained. It was (3R), so it remains **(5R)**.\n*   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted. The original configuration was (6S).\n\n**Crucial Point: Does geometric inversion from an Sₙ2 reaction always change an S descriptor to an R descriptor?**\nNot necessarily. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents. In this reaction, the leaving group at C6 is an oxygen atom (part of the epoxide), which has a high priority. The incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority. This change in substituent priorities means we must re-evaluate the configuration of the new stereocenter (C2) from first principles rather than just flipping the letter.\n\n*   **Detailed Analysis of C2 (from C6):**\n    1.  A detailed 3D analysis of the starting material (1R,3R,4R,6S) shows that the C6-O bond is on one face of the ring (e.g., 'up'), and the C6-H bond is on the other ('down').\n    2.  The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile occurs from the backside, opposite the C-O bond. So, the methyl group adds to the 'down' face.\n    3.  This attack pushes the hydrogen atom from the 'down' face to the 'up' face (geometric inversion).\n    4.  Now we assign the CIP configuration to the new C2. The groups are C1, C3, Me, and H. The H is now 'up' (wedge), and the new Me is 'down' (dash).\n    5.  The priorities are: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    6.  With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards the viewer ('up'/wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (C1 → C3 → Me). This path is clockwise.\n    7.  According to the CIP rules, a clockwise path when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The geometric inversion at C6 results in a product with an **(S)** configuration at the new C2 center. The final product's stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe derived product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide functional group is between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides two key rules that govern this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide ring and is also bonded to a methyl group (as indicated by the \"1,3,4-trimethyl\" part of the name). This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide ring but is bonded to a hydrogen atom, not a methyl group. This makes C6 a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\nThe attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring. After an aqueous workup (which is standard for these reactions to yield the final alcohol product), a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1, and a new methyl group is added to C6.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are on the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one on C6.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (original C1) places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (original C6), 4 (original C4), and 5 (original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   Numbering clockwise would give the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n*   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-...).\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Retention:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1(R) → New C1(R)\n    *   Original C4(R) → New C4(R)\n    *   Original C3(R) → New C5(R)\n*   **Inversion:** The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an inversion of configuration. The starting configuration is (6S).\n*   **The Critical Point (The \"Stereochemistry Trap\"):** While the Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (the nucleophile attacks from the opposite face of the leaving group), the R/S descriptor does not necessarily flip. We must re-evaluate the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities in the product.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n    *   **At product C2 (from original C6):** The groups are C1(with OH), C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The leaving group (O) had the highest priority (1), while the incoming group (Me) has a lower priority (3). Because the priority of the incoming group is different from the leaving group, the R/S descriptor does not flip despite the geometric inversion. Therefore, the configuration at this center remains **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n*   This regioselectivity means the product will have a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1 and a new methyl group at C6. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product will be a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have a 2,2,4,5- substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack, C6. The configurations at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the reaction and are therefore **retained**.\n*   **Starting Configurations:** (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S)\n*   **Stereochemical Changes:**\n    *   Configuration at C1 is retained: **R**\n    *   Configuration at C3 is retained: **R**\n    *   Configuration at C4 is retained: **R**\n    *   Configuration at C6 is inverted: (S) → **(R)**\n\n**4. Determine the Final Product's IUPAC Name**\n\n*   We must map the stereochemistry from the reactant's numbering system to the product's IUPAC numbering system.\n    *   The carbon with the new -OH group (original C1) becomes the new **C1**.\n    *   The carbon that was attacked (original C6) becomes the new **C2**.\n    *   The original C4 becomes the new **C4**.\n    *   The original C3 becomes the new **C5**.\n*   Now, we assign the final stereodescriptors:\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained → **(1R)**\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to (R) → **(2R)**\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained → **(4R)**\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained → **(5R)**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe full and correct IUPAC name for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A. The discrepancy in some candidate answers arises from an incorrect analysis of how the R/S descriptor changes upon geometric inversion; the fundamental principle is that an Sₙ2 reaction causes inversion, which in this case changes the descriptor from S to R.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring, with the epoxide formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It serves as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. Two key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThe first step is to identify which of the two epoxide carbons, C1 or C6, is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms: O, C2, C6, and a methyl-carbon).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to three other non-hydrogen atoms: O, C1, and C5).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitutional Isomer of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The product will have a new methyl group at the C6 position and a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the C1 position (after a standard aqueous workup).\n*   To name the product, we must renumber the ring according to IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) becomes the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the four methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1 (original C1), C2 (original C6), C4 (original C4), and C5 (original C3).\n*   This analysis of the product's constitution eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would arise from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack (C6), while the other stereocenters retain their configuration.\n*   **Configuration at C1:** Retained as **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C3:** Retained as **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C4:** Retained as **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C6:** Inverted. The starting configuration is **(S)**, so the new configuration will be **(R)**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Product Name**\nWe now map the stereochemical outcomes to the new IUPAC numbering of the product:\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): The configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This perfectly matches our derived product.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect constitution.\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would imply retention of configuration, which is contrary to the Sₙ2 mechanism.\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect constitution and stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, considering the points of agreement and disagreement among the provided answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Principles**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Key Principles:** The problem provides the rules for this reaction type:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first critical step. We must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a more substituted and sterically hindered position. It is a quaternary center (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a less substituted and sterically less hindered position. It is a tertiary center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nBased on the principle of attacking the less hindered carbon, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**. This opens the epoxide ring, and after workup, an -OH group will be on C1 and the new methyl group will be on C6. The resulting product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Numbering**\n\n*   The attack at C6 creates a product with methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position. The hydroxyl group is at the original C1 position.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**. To give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the new **C2**. This results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would arise from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most complex step and where the candidate answers show divergence. We must apply the Sₙ2 inversion rule correctly.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   Original C1 was **R** → New C1 remains **R**.\n    *   Original C4 was **R** → New C4 remains **R**.\n    *   Original C3 was **R** → New C5 remains **R**.\n*   **Attacked Center:** The configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n    *   Original C6 was **S**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion of the substituents. This inversion of the three-dimensional arrangement leads to an inversion of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog descriptor from **S** to **R**. While there are rare exceptions to this rule if substituent priorities change drastically, that is not the case here. The leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by a methyl group (lower priority), which ensures the descriptor flips.\n    *   Therefore, the new C2 (which was the original C6) has an **R** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the results from the IUPAC numbering and the stereochemical analysis, we can assemble the full name of the product:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this specific reaction type.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The first rule given is that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n*   This attack opens the epoxide ring, and after workup, an alcohol (-OH) group is formed at C1. The product's basic structure will be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful analysis.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original absolute configurations.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 remains **(R)**. In the product, this corresponds to the C5 position, so it is **(5R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**. In the product, this corresponds to the C4 position, so it is **(4R)**.\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The second rule states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is a classic Sₙ2 reaction feature.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion, like an umbrella flipping inside out). However, we cannot automatically assume that the R/S descriptor will flip from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n    *   **Let's analyze the change in priorities at the attacked carbon:**\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are -O-, -C1, -C5, and -H. The priorities are: O (1) > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   **At product C2 (which was C6):** The substituents are -C1, -C3(from C5), the new -CH₃, and -H. The leaving group (-O-, priority 1) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (-CH₃, which has a lower priority). The new priorities are: C1 (1) > C3 (2) > CH₃ (3) > H (4).\n    *   **The Consequence of Inversion:** A detailed analysis, considering both the geometric inversion and the significant change in substituent priorities (the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group), shows that the absolute configuration descriptor does *not* change. The geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n*   **Final Stereochemistry of the Product:** Combining the results, the product has the absolute configuration **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Comparing this to the remaining options:\n\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this specific reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary center (if counting the oxygen) or a tertiary carbon (if counting only carbon substituents).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary center (if counting the oxygen) or a secondary carbon (if counting only carbon substituents).\n\nRegardless of the classification system, the methyl group on C1 makes it significantly more sterically hindered than C6, which only has a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack of a methyl group at C6 and the subsequent opening of the epoxide ring (with protonation during workup) results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product will have four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. To give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise from the new C1.\n    *   New C1 (was old C1) has a methyl group.\n    *   New C2 (was old C6) has the newly added methyl group.\n    *   New C4 (was old C4) has a methyl group.\n    *   New C5 (was old C3) has a methyl group.\n*   The product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This constitutional structure eliminates options B and C, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. The choice is now between A and D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must determine the R/S configuration of each chiral center in the product.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly attacked, so their stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   Original C1 was (R) → New C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was (R) → New C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was (R) → New C5 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Attacked Center (Inversion):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is (6S).\n    *   A simple assumption would be that S inverts to R. However, this is not always correct because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change. The leaving group (Oxygen) was priority #1, while the incoming group (Methyl) has a lower priority. A more rigorous analysis is required.\n    *   **Detailed Analysis:** Let's establish the 3D structure. For C6 to be (S) with the epoxide oxygen 'up' (beta), the hydrogen at C6 must also be 'up' (beta). The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile must occur from the opposite ('down' or alpha) face. This pushes the 'up' hydrogen to stay 'up', while the new methyl group is added 'down'.\n    *   Now, we assign the CIP configuration to this new center (C2 in the product). The groups are C1, C3, Me, and H. The priorities are C1 > C3 > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is pointing 'up' (towards the viewer). The path from C1 → C3 → Me is clockwise. According to the CIP rules, a clockwise path when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer results in an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the stereochemical assignments, the final product is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, causing an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution and IUPAC Numbering of the Product**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group there and opens the ring to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1 after workup.\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as the new **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (on the original C6), 4 (on the original C4), and 5 (on the original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}. The alternative clockwise numbering gives {1, 3, 4, 6}, which is a higher set.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and B, which have an incorrect `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern. The correct answer must be C or D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step and requires a careful 3D analysis.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction are retained.\n    *   Original C1 → New C1: Retains **(R)** configuration.\n    *   Original C4 → New C4: Retains **(R)** configuration.\n    *   Original C3 → New C5: Retains **(R)** configuration.\n    *   The product has the partial stereochemistry `(1R, 4R, 5R)`. Both options C and D agree on this. The deciding factor is the stereochemistry at the new C2.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6 → C2):** The reaction causes a geometric inversion at C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**. We must determine the resulting R/S descriptor at the new C2. It is a common mistake to assume that geometric inversion always flips the R/S descriptor; this is not true if the group priorities change.\n\n*   **3D Analysis:**\n    1.  Let's draw the starting material with wedges and dashes. To satisfy the given stereochemistry, we can draw the epoxide oxygen on a wedge (up). This means the C1-Me must be on a dash (down), the C6-H must be on a wedge (up), the C3-Me must be on a dash (down), and the C4-Me must be on a dash (down).\n    2.  The Sₙ2 attack on C6 occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the C6-O bond is on a wedge (up), the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the dash side (down).\n    3.  This inverts the geometry at C6. The C6-H, which was on a wedge (up), remains on a wedge (up). The new methyl group is added on a dash (down).\n    4.  Now we assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configuration to this newly formed stereocenter (C2 in the product).\n    5.  **Priorities at the new C2:**\n        *   Priority 1: C1 (bonded to an Oxygen).\n        *   Priority 2: C3 (a ring carbon, which is higher priority than a methyl group).\n        *   Priority 3: The new methyl group.\n        *   Priority 4: The hydrogen atom.\n    6.  **Assigning R/S:** At C2, we have the lowest priority group (H) on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. The path from C1 → C3 → Me is **clockwise**. Because the lowest priority group is on a wedge, we **reverse** the result. Clockwise becomes Counter-clockwise.\n    7.  A counter-clockwise path corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a new center with an **(S)** configuration. This is a known phenomenon where the change in CIP priorities upon reaction means the descriptor does not flip from S to R despite the inversion.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1: **(R)**\n    *   C2: **(S)**\n    *   C4: **(R)**\n    *   C5: **(R)**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Type and Key Principles\nThe reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, by an organocuprate reagent, Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate). The problem provides, and general organic chemistry principles confirm, two crucial rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (in this case, a methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves a backside attack and results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regiochemistry (Site of Attack)\nWe need to identify the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is formed between C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group, as indicated by the \"1,3,4-trimethyl\" part of the name. It is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C2, C6, and a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nComparing the two, the tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\nThis attack opens the ring to form a cyclohexanol derivative. The hydroxyl group (-OH) will be at C1, and the new methyl group will be at C6. The product's constitution will be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (after renumbering according to IUPAC rules, where the OH-bearing carbon is C1). This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl substitution pattern that would arise from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry\nThe choice between C and D hinges on the final configuration of the stereocenter that was attacked (C6, which becomes C2 in the product).\n\n1.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original absolute configurations.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 (which becomes C5 in the product) remains **(R)**.\n    So, the product must have the partial stereochemistry (1R, 4R, 5R). Both options C and D satisfy this.\n\n2.  **Inverted Center (The Deciding Factor):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   A common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion from an (S) configuration automatically results in an (R) configuration. This is not always true, as the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change during the reaction. We must determine the configuration of the new stereocenter (C2) based on its final structure.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The configuration is (S).\n    *   **At product C2:** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The leaving group (O, priority 1 at C6) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, which has priority 3 at C2).\n    *   Let's perform the CIP assignment on the product C2. The Sₙ2 attack is a backside attack, causing a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). If the C6-O bond was \"up\", the new C2-Me bond will be \"down\", and the C2-H will be \"up\".\n    *   **Priorities at C2:** C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing \"up\" (towards the viewer, on a wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (C1 → C3 → Me). This path is clockwise.\n    *   According to CIP rules, a clockwise path with the lowest priority group pointing towards the viewer corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the configuration at C2 is **(S)**.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the stereochemical results:\n*   C1 is (R)\n*   C2 is (S)\n*   C4 is (R)\n*   C5 is (R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C. The majority of the provided candidate answers that selected option D made the common error of assuming that the inversion of an (S) center must yield an (R) center without re-evaluating the CIP priorities.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\nThe prompt provides the first key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 adds a methyl group there, and the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1 after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest locants to the methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1 (original C1), C2 (original C6), C4 (original C4), and C5 (original C3).\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options A and B, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThe prompt provides the second key rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This implies an Sₙ2-type backside attack.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly attacked (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C3 (which becomes C5 in the product) remains **(R)**.\n*   **Attacked Center:** The configuration at C6 (which becomes C2 in the product) is inverted.\n    *   The starting configuration is **(6S)**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). We must carefully determine the resulting R/S descriptor, as it depends on the change in Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n    *   In the reactant, the leaving group at C6 is the epoxide oxygen (priority 1). In the product, the incoming group is a methyl group (priority 3). This significant change in substituent priorities means that the R/S descriptor does not necessarily flip from S to R.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis shows that the backside attack pushes the hydrogen on C6 from one face of the ring to the other. When the CIP rules are applied to the resulting product at C2, the configuration is determined to be **(S)**. The geometric inversion results in a product that is also described as S.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nCombining the stereochemical results:\n*   C1 is **(R)**\n*   C2 is **(S)**\n*   C4 is **(R)**\n*   C5 is **(R)**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. Two key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nWe must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\nThis attack pattern results in a product where the original methyl group is on C1 and the new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C6). After renumbering according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This constitutional structure eliminates options B and D, which are named as 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (implying attack at C1). The correct answer must be either A or C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack. The configurations of the other stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction are retained.\n\n*   **Track the configurations from reactant to product:**\n    *   Reactant configurations: (1R), (3R), (4R), **(6S)**.\n    *   The product is renumbered for IUPAC naming: original C1 becomes new C1, original C6 becomes new C2, original C4 becomes new C4, and original C3 becomes new C5.\n\n*   **Determine the product's configuration:**\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** The configuration is retained. It remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** This is the site of attack. The configuration is inverted. The original (S) configuration becomes **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained. It remains **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained. It remains **(R)**.\n\n**4. Final Product Identification**\n\nCombining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe derived product matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product of the reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with defined stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt provides the key rules for this reaction: the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and the attack proceeds with inversion of configuration.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. After an aqueous workup (an implied step to get the final alcohol product), a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   To name the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1, C2 (the original C6), C4, and C5.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options A and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol). The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step. The reaction proceeds with Sₙ2-type inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (C6), while the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) retain their configuration.\n\n*   **Retention at C1, C3, and C4:**\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C3 remains **(R)**. In the product, this corresponds to C5, so it is **(5R)**.\n\n*   **Inversion at C6:**\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, one must be careful to re-evaluate the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the product, as the R/S descriptor does not always flip from S to R upon inversion.\n    *   **Priorities at reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (from the epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). This gives the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Priorities at product C2 (original C6):** The substituents are -C1(OH,Me)-, -C3-, the new -CH₃, and -H. The priority order is C1(1) > C3(2) > CH₃(3) > H(4).\n    *   The leaving group (-O-) had the highest priority (1), while the incoming nucleophile (-CH₃) has a lower priority (3). This change in substituent priorities means that despite the geometric inversion, the CIP descriptor remains **(S)**. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the inverted center is assigned the (S) configuration.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is:\n*   C1: **R**\n*   C2: **S**\n*   C4: **R**\n*   C5: **R**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the points of consensus and resolving the points of conflict from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Principles\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Rules:** The problem specifies the two key principles governing this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon, which is characteristic of an Sₙ2 mechanism.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThis step determines the basic structure (constitution) of the product. We must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms: O, C2, C6, and a methyl-carbon).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to three non-hydrogen atoms: O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nA tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**. This attack opens the epoxide ring, and after workup, a hydroxyl (-OH) group forms at C1.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Name\nThe attack at C6 results in a product with methyl groups at the original C1, C3, and C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position. The hydroxyl group is at the original C1 position.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as the new **C1**.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the new **C2**.\n*   This results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis immediately eliminates options C and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would arise from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either A or B.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step and the source of disagreement among the candidate answers. It requires a careful application of the Sₙ2 inversion rule.\n\n*   **Unaffected Stereocenters:** The configurations at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) are **retained**.\n    *   Original C1 was (R) → New C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was (R) → New C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was (R) → New C5 remains **(R)**.\n    The product must have the partial stereochemistry `(1R, 4R, 5R)`. Both options A and B satisfy this.\n\n*   **The Attacked Stereocenter (The Deciding Factor):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**. We must determine if the resulting configuration at the new C2 is (R) or (S).\n    *   **The \"Stereochemistry Trap\":** A common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion of an (S) center automatically results in an (R) center. This is only true if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents do not change order. In this reaction, they do.\n    *   **Analysis of Priority Change:**\n        *   At the reactant's C6, the leaving group is the epoxide oxygen (-O-), which has the **highest priority (#1)**.\n        *   At the product's C2, the incoming group is a methyl group (-CH₃), which has a **lower priority (#3)** than the adjacent ring carbons.\n    *   **Correct Analysis:** Because the highest-priority leaving group is replaced by a lower-priority incoming group, the simple S→R flip is invalid. A detailed 3D analysis is required. This analysis shows that the geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out) combined with the re-assignment of CIP priorities results in a final configuration that is **(S)**. The geometric inversion occurs, but the R/S descriptor does not flip.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nBy combining the constitutional name and the correct stereochemical analysis, we can assemble the full name of the product:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, **2S**, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<B>>>"

This corresponds to the original C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the new C1 towards the original C6 (which is now the new C2) gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The product's constitutional name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern that would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the deciding step between options B and C.\n*   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 was (R) → Product C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was (R) → Product C5 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was (R) → Product C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an inversion of configuration.\n    *   Original C6 was **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack causes a geometric inversion (like an umbrella flipping inside out).\n    *   **Crucial Point:** We must determine if this geometric inversion from (S) results in an (R) or (S) descriptor in the product. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents, which have changed.\n        *   **At C6 (reactant):** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H.\n        *   **At C2 (product, from C6):** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The leaving group (O, priority 1) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, priority 3).\n    *   A detailed analysis of the 3D structure and the new CIP priorities shows that the geometric inversion of the (S) center at C6 results in a new center at C2 with an **(S)** configuration. The change in substituent priorities means the R/S descriptor does not flip in this specific case, even though the geometry inverts.\n\n**5.

Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The first rule given is that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A carbon bonded to a methyl group is significantly more sterically hindered than one bonded to a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack of a methyl group at C6 and the subsequent opening of the epoxide ring (with workup) results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product, IUPAC rules dictate that the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (the newly added one on original C6), 4, and 5. This locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   The constitutional name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The second rule given is that **inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added**. This is the defining characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly attacked (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n*   Let's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product:\n    *   **C1:** The configuration is retained. It was (R) and remains **(R)**.\n    *   **C3:** The configuration is retained. It was (R). In the new numbering system, this carbon is C5, so its configuration is **(5R)**.\n    *   **C4:** The configuration is retained. It was (R) and remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **C6:** This is the site of attack. The configuration is inverted. It was (S), so after inversion, it becomes **(R)**. In the new numbering system, this carbon is C2, so its configuration is **(2R)**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemical analysis, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Comparing this to the remaining options:\n    *   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   The derived product matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reaction and Reactants**\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, by an organocuprate reagent, Me₂CuLi.\n*   **Key Principles:** The problem provides two crucial rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (methyl group) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring, and a subsequent workup (standard procedure) forms a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original three at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** The carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. To give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered such that the methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), implying an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful analysis.\n*   **Retention:** The stereocenters not involved in the attack (C1, C3, C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1 was (R) → Product C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was (R) → Product C5 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was (R) → Product C4 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Inversion:** The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an inversion of configuration. The original configuration was **(6S)**.\n*   **The Pitfall:** Simply flipping 'S' to 'R' is a common shortcut, but it is only valid if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents do not change significantly. In this case, they do:\n    *   At reactant C6, the leaving group (epoxide oxygen) is the highest priority substituent.\n    *   At product C2 (the new name for the attacked carbon), the incoming methyl group has a lower priority than the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   **Correct Analysis:** We must consider the actual geometric inversion (a Walden inversion) and then re-assign the configuration using CIP rules. A detailed analysis (as performed correctly by agents 4, 9, and 10) shows that the geometric inversion at the (6S) center results in a product center with an **(S)** configuration.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reaction type.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The problem states a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group to that carbon. The C6-O bond breaks, and after workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest locants to the methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1, C2 (from the original C6), C4 (from the original C4), and C5 (from the original C3).\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol), which would arise from an attack at C1. The choice is between A and B.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The problem states another key rule: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The configurations of the stereocenters not involved in the attack (C1, C3, C4) are **retained**.\n*   The configuration of the stereocenter that is attacked (C6) is **inverted**.\n\nLet's map the stereochemistry from the reactant to the product:\n*   **New C1 (from original C1):** Configuration is retained. It was (1R), so it remains **(1R)**.\n*   **New C4 (from original C4):** Configuration is retained. It was (4R), so it remains **(4R)**.\n*   **New C5 (from original C3):** Configuration is retained. It was (3R), so it remains **(5R)**.\n*   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted. The original configuration was (6S).\n\n**Crucial Point: Does geometric inversion from an Sₙ2 reaction always change an S descriptor to an R descriptor?**\nNot necessarily. The R/S descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents. In this reaction, the leaving group at C6 is an oxygen atom (part of the epoxide), which has a high priority. The incoming group is a methyl group, which has a lower priority. This change in substituent priorities means we must re-evaluate the configuration of the new stereocenter (C2) from first principles rather than just flipping the letter.\n\n*   **Detailed Analysis of C2 (from C6):**\n    1.  A detailed 3D analysis of the starting material (1R,3R,4R,6S) shows that the C6-O bond is on one face of the ring (e.g., 'up'), and the C6-H bond is on the other ('down').\n    2.  The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile occurs from the backside, opposite the C-O bond. So, the methyl group adds to the 'down' face.\n    3.  This attack pushes the hydrogen atom from the 'down' face to the 'up' face (geometric inversion).\n    4.  Now we assign the CIP configuration to the new C2. The groups are C1, C3, Me, and H. The H is now 'up' (wedge), and the new Me is 'down' (dash).\n    5.  The priorities are: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    6.  With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards the viewer ('up'/wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (C1 → C3 → Me). This path is clockwise.\n    7.  According to the CIP rules, a clockwise path when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The geometric inversion at C6 results in a product with an **(S)** configuration at the new C2 center. The final product's stereochemistry is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\nThe derived product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide functional group is between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides two key rules that govern this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is part of the epoxide ring and is also bonded to a methyl group (as indicated by the \"1,3,4-trimethyl\" part of the name). This makes C1 a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is also part of the epoxide ring but is bonded to a hydrogen atom, not a methyl group. This makes C6 a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\nThe attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring. After an aqueous workup (which is standard for these reactions to yield the final alcohol product), a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1, and a new methyl group is added to C6.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants. The methyl groups are on the original C1, C3, C4, and the newly added one on C6.\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (original C1) places the methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (original C6), 4 (original C4), and 5 (original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n*   Numbering clockwise would give the locant set {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n*   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower. Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-...).\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Retention:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the nucleophilic attack (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Original C1(R) → New C1(R)\n    *   Original C4(R) → New C4(R)\n    *   Original C3(R) → New C5(R)\n*   **Inversion:** The stereocenter that is attacked (C6) undergoes an inversion of configuration. The starting configuration is (6S).\n*   **The Critical Point (The \"Stereochemistry Trap\"):** While the Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (the nucleophile attacks from the opposite face of the leaving group), the R/S descriptor does not necessarily flip. We must re-evaluate the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities in the product.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). The configuration is (S).\n    *   **At product C2 (from original C6):** The groups are C1(with OH), C3, Me, H. The priorities are C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The leaving group (O) had the highest priority (1), while the incoming group (Me) has a lower priority (3). Because the priority of the incoming group is different from the leaving group, the R/S descriptor does not flip despite the geometric inversion. Therefore, the configuration at this center remains **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results:\n*   **Name:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, synthesizing the correct points from the provided answers and resolving their contradictions.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with the specified absolute stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides two key rules for this specific reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare their steric hindrance. Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group). Carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   A quaternary carbon is significantly more sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n*   This regioselectivity means the product will have a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1 and a new methyl group at C6. When renumbered according to IUPAC rules, the product will be a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options B and C, which have a 2,2,4,5- substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack, C6. The configurations at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not directly involved in the reaction and are therefore **retained**.\n*   **Starting Configurations:** (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S)\n*   **Stereochemical Changes:**\n    *   Configuration at C1 is retained: **R**\n    *   Configuration at C3 is retained: **R**\n    *   Configuration at C4 is retained: **R**\n    *   Configuration at C6 is inverted: (S) → **(R)**\n\n**4. Determine the Final Product's IUPAC Name**\n\n*   We must map the stereochemistry from the reactant's numbering system to the product's IUPAC numbering system.\n    *   The carbon with the new -OH group (original C1) becomes the new **C1**.\n    *   The carbon that was attacked (original C6) becomes the new **C2**.\n    *   The original C4 becomes the new **C4**.\n    *   The original C3 becomes the new **C5**.\n*   Now, we assign the final stereodescriptors:\n    *   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained → **(1R)**\n    *   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to (R) → **(2R)**\n    *   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained → **(4R)**\n    *   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained → **(5R)**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe full and correct IUPAC name for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A. The discrepancy in some candidate answers arises from an incorrect analysis of how the R/S descriptor changes upon geometric inversion; the fundamental principle is that an Sₙ2 reaction causes inversion, which in this case changes the descriptor from S to R.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring, with the epoxide formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It serves as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. Two key rules are provided:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the carbon that is attacked (Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nThe first step is to identify which of the two epoxide carbons, C1 or C6, is less sterically hindered.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to four other non-hydrogen atoms: O, C2, C6, and a methyl-carbon).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to three other non-hydrogen atoms: O, C1, and C5).\n\nA quaternary carbon is significantly more hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitutional Isomer of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The product will have a new methyl group at the C6 position and a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the C1 position (after a standard aqueous workup).\n*   To name the product, we must renumber the ring according to IUPAC rules. The carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) becomes the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the four methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1 (original C1), C2 (original C6), C4 (original C4), and C5 (original C3).\n*   This analysis of the product's constitution eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would arise from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\nThe reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack (C6), while the other stereocenters retain their configuration.\n*   **Configuration at C1:** Retained as **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C3:** Retained as **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C4:** Retained as **(R)**.\n*   **Configuration at C6:** Inverted. The starting configuration is **(S)**, so the new configuration will be **(R)**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Product Name**\nWe now map the stereochemical outcomes to the new IUPAC numbering of the product:\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): The configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nCombining these, the full name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   **A) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This perfectly matches our derived product.\n*   B) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect constitution.\n*   C) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect stereochemistry at C2. This would imply retention of configuration, which is contrary to the Sₙ2 mechanism.\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect constitution and stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product, considering the points of agreement and disagreement among the provided answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Principles**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Key Principles:** The problem provides the rules for this reaction type:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\nThis is the first critical step. We must compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a more substituted and sterically hindered position. It is a quaternary center (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a less substituted and sterically less hindered position. It is a tertiary center (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n\nBased on the principle of attacking the less hindered carbon, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**. This opens the epoxide ring, and after workup, an -OH group will be on C1 and the new methyl group will be on C6. The resulting product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Numbering**\n\n*   The attack at C6 creates a product with methyl groups at the original C1, C3, C4 positions, and a new methyl group at the original C6 position. The hydroxyl group is at the original C1 position.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new **C1**. To give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the new **C2**. This results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This eliminates options C and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-), which would arise from an incorrect attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most complex step and where the candidate answers show divergence. We must apply the Sₙ2 inversion rule correctly.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   Original C1 was **R** → New C1 remains **R**.\n    *   Original C4 was **R** → New C4 remains **R**.\n    *   Original C3 was **R** → New C5 remains **R**.\n*   **Attacked Center:** The configuration at the site of attack (C6) is inverted.\n    *   Original C6 was **S**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion of the substituents. This inversion of the three-dimensional arrangement leads to an inversion of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog descriptor from **S** to **R**. While there are rare exceptions to this rule if substituent priorities change drastically, that is not the case here. The leaving group (O, priority 1) is replaced by a methyl group (lower priority), which ensures the descriptor flips.\n    *   Therefore, the new C2 (which was the original C6) has an **R** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the results from the IUPAC numbering and the stereochemical analysis, we can assemble the full name of the product:\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this specific reaction type.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The first rule given is that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two carbons:\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   A tertiary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n*   This attack opens the epoxide ring, and after workup, an alcohol (-OH) group is formed at C1. The product's basic structure will be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical step and requires careful analysis.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original absolute configurations.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 remains **(R)**. In the product, this corresponds to the C5 position, so it is **(5R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**. In the product, this corresponds to the C4 position, so it is **(4R)**.\n*   **Attacked Center (C6):** The second rule states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is a classic Sₙ2 reaction feature.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion, like an umbrella flipping inside out). However, we cannot automatically assume that the R/S descriptor will flip from S to R. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which change during the reaction.\n    *   **Let's analyze the change in priorities at the attacked carbon:**\n        *   **At reactant C6:** The substituents are -O-, -C1, -C5, and -H. The priorities are: O (1) > C1 (2) > C5 (3) > H (4). The configuration is (S).\n        *   **At product C2 (which was C6):** The substituents are -C1, -C3(from C5), the new -CH₃, and -H. The leaving group (-O-, priority 1) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (-CH₃, which has a lower priority). The new priorities are: C1 (1) > C3 (2) > CH₃ (3) > H (4).\n    *   **The Consequence of Inversion:** A detailed analysis, considering both the geometric inversion and the significant change in substituent priorities (the highest priority group is replaced by a lower priority group), shows that the absolute configuration descriptor does *not* change. The geometric inversion of the (S) center results in a new center that is also designated as **(S)**.\n*   **Final Stereochemistry of the Product:** Combining the results, the product has the absolute configuration **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. Comparing this to the remaining options:\n\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur derived product matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, with specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this specific reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2-type reaction, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\nWe need to compare the steric hindrance at the two carbons of the epoxide ring, C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary center (if counting the oxygen) or a tertiary carbon (if counting only carbon substituents).\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary center (if counting the oxygen) or a secondary carbon (if counting only carbon substituents).\n\nRegardless of the classification system, the methyl group on C1 makes it significantly more sterically hindered than C6, which only has a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n\n*   The attack of a methyl group at C6 and the subsequent opening of the epoxide ring (with protonation during workup) results in a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   The product will have four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as C1. To give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring counter-clockwise from the new C1.\n    *   New C1 (was old C1) has a methyl group.\n    *   New C2 (was old C6) has the newly added methyl group.\n    *   New C4 (was old C4) has a methyl group.\n    *   New C5 (was old C3) has a methyl group.\n*   The product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This constitutional structure eliminates options B and C, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. The choice is now between A and D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We must determine the R/S configuration of each chiral center in the product.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not directly attacked, so their stereochemistry is retained.\n    *   Original C1 was (R) → New C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C4 was (R) → New C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   Original C3 was (R) → New C5 remains **(R)**.\n*   **Attacked Center (Inversion):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is (6S).\n    *   A simple assumption would be that S inverts to R. However, this is not always correct because the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change. The leaving group (Oxygen) was priority #1, while the incoming group (Methyl) has a lower priority. A more rigorous analysis is required.\n    *   **Detailed Analysis:** Let's establish the 3D structure. For C6 to be (S) with the epoxide oxygen 'up' (beta), the hydrogen at C6 must also be 'up' (beta). The Sₙ2 attack by the methyl nucleophile must occur from the opposite ('down' or alpha) face. This pushes the 'up' hydrogen to stay 'up', while the new methyl group is added 'down'.\n    *   Now, we assign the CIP configuration to this new center (C2 in the product). The groups are C1, C3, Me, and H. The priorities are C1 > C3 > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is pointing 'up' (towards the viewer). The path from C1 → C3 → Me is clockwise. According to the CIP rules, a clockwise path when the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer results in an **(S)** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **(S)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the stereochemical assignments, the final product is **(1R, 2S, 4R, 5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a definitive, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Rules**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, causing an **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and H).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion:** The nucleophilic methyl group attacks **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Constitution and IUPAC Numbering of the Product**\n\n*   The attack at C6 adds a methyl group there and opens the ring to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1 after workup.\n*   The product is a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as the new **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 gives methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (on the original C6), 4 (on the original C4), and 5 (on the original C3). This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}. The alternative clockwise numbering gives {1, 3, 4, 6}, which is a higher set.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and B, which have an incorrect `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern. The correct answer must be C or D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThis is the most critical step and requires a careful 3D analysis.\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The configurations at the stereocenters not involved in the reaction are retained.\n    *   Original C1 → New C1: Retains **(R)** configuration.\n    *   Original C4 → New C4: Retains **(R)** configuration.\n    *   Original C3 → New C5: Retains **(R)** configuration.\n    *   The product has the partial stereochemistry `(1R, 4R, 5R)`. Both options C and D agree on this. The deciding factor is the stereochemistry at the new C2.\n\n*   **Attacked Center (C6 → C2):** The reaction causes a geometric inversion at C6. The starting configuration is **(6S)**. We must determine the resulting R/S descriptor at the new C2. It is a common mistake to assume that geometric inversion always flips the R/S descriptor; this is not true if the group priorities change.\n\n*   **3D Analysis:**\n    1.  Let's draw the starting material with wedges and dashes. To satisfy the given stereochemistry, we can draw the epoxide oxygen on a wedge (up). This means the C1-Me must be on a dash (down), the C6-H must be on a wedge (up), the C3-Me must be on a dash (down), and the C4-Me must be on a dash (down).\n    2.  The Sₙ2 attack on C6 occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond. Since the C6-O bond is on a wedge (up), the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks from the dash side (down).\n    3.  This inverts the geometry at C6. The C6-H, which was on a wedge (up), remains on a wedge (up). The new methyl group is added on a dash (down).\n    4.  Now we assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configuration to this newly formed stereocenter (C2 in the product).\n    5.  **Priorities at the new C2:**\n        *   Priority 1: C1 (bonded to an Oxygen).\n        *   Priority 2: C3 (a ring carbon, which is higher priority than a methyl group).\n        *   Priority 3: The new methyl group.\n        *   Priority 4: The hydrogen atom.\n    6.  **Assigning R/S:** At C2, we have the lowest priority group (H) on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. The path from C1 → C3 → Me is **clockwise**. Because the lowest priority group is on a wedge, we **reverse** the result. Clockwise becomes Counter-clockwise.\n    7.  A counter-clockwise path corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a new center with an **(S)** configuration. This is a known phenomenon where the change in CIP priorities upon reaction means the descriptor does not flip from S to R despite the inversion.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1: **(R)**\n    *   C2: **(S)**\n    *   C4: **(R)**\n    *   C5: **(R)**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Type and Key Principles\nThe reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, by an organocuprate reagent, Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate). The problem provides, and general organic chemistry principles confirm, two crucial rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (in this case, a methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves a backside attack and results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regiochemistry (Site of Attack)\nWe need to identify the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, which is formed between C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   **Carbon C1:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group, as indicated by the \"1,3,4-trimethyl\" part of the name. It is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C2, C6, and a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon.\n*   **Carbon C6:** This carbon is bonded to the epoxide oxygen, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon.\n\nComparing the two, the tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\nThis attack opens the ring to form a cyclohexanol derivative. The hydroxyl group (-OH) will be at C1, and the new methyl group will be at C6. The product's constitution will be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (after renumbering according to IUPAC rules, where the OH-bearing carbon is C1). This immediately eliminates options A and B, which have a 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl substitution pattern that would arise from an attack at C1. The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry\nThe choice between C and D hinges on the final configuration of the stereocenter that was attacked (C6, which becomes C2 in the product).\n\n1.  **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original absolute configurations.\n    *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   C3 (which becomes C5 in the product) remains **(R)**.\n    So, the product must have the partial stereochemistry (1R, 4R, 5R). Both options C and D satisfy this.\n\n2.  **Inverted Center (The Deciding Factor):** The reaction causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration is given as **(6S)**.\n    *   A common mistake is to assume that a geometric inversion from an (S) configuration automatically results in an (R) configuration. This is not always true, as the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change during the reaction. We must determine the configuration of the new stereocenter (C2) based on its final structure.\n    *   **At reactant C6:** The groups are O, C1, C5, H. The configuration is (S).\n    *   **At product C2:** The groups are C1, C3, Me, H. The leaving group (O, priority 1 at C6) has been replaced by the incoming nucleophile (Me, which has priority 3 at C2).\n    *   Let's perform the CIP assignment on the product C2. The Sₙ2 attack is a backside attack, causing a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). If the C6-O bond was \"up\", the new C2-Me bond will be \"down\", and the C2-H will be \"up\".\n    *   **Priorities at C2:** C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing \"up\" (towards the viewer, on a wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (C1 → C3 → Me). This path is clockwise.\n    *   According to CIP rules, a clockwise path with the lowest priority group pointing towards the viewer corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the configuration at C2 is **(S)**.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the stereochemical results:\n*   C1 is (R)\n*   C2 is (S)\n*   C4 is (R)\n*   C5 is (R)\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option C. The majority of the provided candidate answers that selected option D made the common error of assuming that the inversion of an (S) center must yield an (R) center without re-evaluating the CIP priorities.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product from the given options.\n\n**1.

Determine the Constitution of the Product**\nThe attack at C6 adds a methyl group there, and the epoxide opens to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1 after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product via IUPAC rules, the carbon with the -OH group is designated C1. Numbering the ring to give the lowest locants to the methyl groups results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1 (original C1), C2 (original C6), C4 (original C4), and C5 (original C3).\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options A and B, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The correct answer must be either C or D.\n\n**4.

We must carefully determine the resulting R/S descriptor, as it depends on the change in Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n    *   In the reactant, the leaving group at C6 is the epoxide oxygen (priority 1). In the product, the incoming group is a methyl group (priority 3). This significant change in substituent priorities means that the R/S descriptor does not necessarily flip from S to R.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis shows that the backside attack pushes the hydrogen on C6 from one face of the ring to the other. When the CIP rules are applied to the resulting product at C2, the configuration is determined to be **(S)**. The geometric inversion results in a product that is also described as S.\n\n**5.

After renumbering according to IUPAC rules, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Final Product Identification**\n\nCombining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the remaining options:\n*   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe derived product matches option C exactly.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product of the reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 with defined stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt provides the key rules for this reaction: the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and the attack proceeds with inversion of configuration.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)\nThe first rule states that the nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Carbon C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **Carbon C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   The tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less hindered than the quaternary carbon (C1). Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Constitution of the Product\nThe attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. After an aqueous workup (an implied step to get the final alcohol product), a hydroxyl (-OH) group is formed at C1, and a new methyl group is attached to C6.\n*   To name the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1.\n*   Numbering the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants results in the name **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. The methyl groups are at the new C1, C2 (the original C6), C4, and C5.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options A and C, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol). The correct answer must be either B or D.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product\nThis is the most critical step. The reaction proceeds with Sₙ2-type inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (C6), while the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) retain their configuration.\n\n*   **Retention at C1, C3, and C4:**\n    *   The configuration at C1 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C4 remains **(R)**.\n    *   The configuration at C3 remains **(R)**. In the product, this corresponds to C5, so it is **(5R)**.\n\n*   **Inversion at C6:**\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n    *   An Sₙ2 reaction causes a geometric inversion (a Walden inversion). However, one must be careful to re-evaluate the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the product, as the R/S descriptor does not always flip from S to R upon inversion.\n    *   **Priorities at reactant C6:** The substituents are -O- (from the epoxide), -C1-, -C5-, and -H. The priority order is O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4). This gives the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Priorities at product C2 (original C6):** The substituents are -C1(OH,Me)-, -C3-, the new -CH₃, and -H. The priority order is C1(1) > C3(2) > CH₃(3) > H(4).\n    *   The leaving group (-O-) had the highest priority (1), while the incoming nucleophile (-CH₃) has a lower priority (3). This change in substituent priorities means that despite the geometric inversion, the CIP descriptor remains **(S)**. A detailed 3D analysis confirms that the inverted center is assigned the (S) configuration.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nCombining the stereochemical results, the final product is:\n*   C1: **R**\n*   C2: **S**\n*   C4: **R**\n*   C5: **R**\n\nThe full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
