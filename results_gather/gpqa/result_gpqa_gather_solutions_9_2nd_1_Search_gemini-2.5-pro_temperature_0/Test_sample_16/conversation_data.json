Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Relevant Equilibrium:** The question asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution that starts with the Ca-EDTA complex. This means we need to consider the *dissociation* of the complex to find the concentration of the resulting free ions. The dissociation reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:**\n    *   The problem provides the **formation constant** ($K_f$), which corresponds to the formation reaction: $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$.\n    *   $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    *   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression:**\n    *   The expression for the dissociation constant is: $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}$\n    *   Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table: $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Approximation:**\n    *   The dissociation constant ($K_d = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$) is extremely small. This indicates that the complex is very stable and only a tiny fraction will dissociate.\n    *   Therefore, 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    *   The equation simplifies to: $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration 'x':**\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n        $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n        $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    *   Take the square root to find x:\n        $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n        $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The value 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n    *   $[Ca^{2+}] \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n        B) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n        C) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n        D) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    *   The calculated value matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points and Analysis of Agent Answers\n*   **Correct Methodology:** Nearly all agents correctly identified the need to use the dissociation constant ($K_d = 1/K_f$) and set up the ICE table and approximation correctly. The calculation of $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is consistently correct across the board.\n*   **Common Error:** The most frequent error among the agents was incorrectly matching their correct numerical result to the lettered options. For example, several agents calculated $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M but then incorrectly concluded the answer was A, B, or D.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\":** This term correctly allowed the agents to use the absolute formation constant ($K_f$) without needing to calculate a conditional constant ($K'_f$), which would have required a specific pH value.\n*   **Consensus:** The overwhelming consensus on the calculation itself points to $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. The agents that arrived at the correct final letter (Answers 1, 2, 3, and 7) followed the correct procedure from start to finish.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct calculation, the final answer is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, the relevant reaction is the dissociation:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nWe are given the formation constant (K_f), which corresponds to the formation of the complex:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nAlternatively, we can work directly with the K_f expression, which yields the same result.\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table**\nLet 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. At equilibrium, 'x' will be the concentration of Ca²⁺.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [CaY]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n**4. Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nUsing the formation constant (K_f) expression with the equilibrium concentrations:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA very large K_f value (5 x 10¹⁰) indicates that the complex is extremely stable and the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore make the valid approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentration of Calcium Ions**\nThe simplified equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹² or 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7. Match with the Options**\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Reaction Direction:** It is crucial to recognize that the system starts with the complex, so the relevant process is dissociation.\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Whether using K_f or K_d, the expression must match the corresponding reaction (formation or dissociation).\n*   **Approximation:** The approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is valid due to the very large K_f, but it's good practice to verify that the resulting 'x' is indeed much smaller than 0.02 (6.3x10⁻⁷ << 0.02).\n*   **Matching Options:** A common error in the candidate answers was correctly calculating the value but then mismatching it with the letter of the multiple-choice option. The calculated value of 6.3x10⁻⁷ M corresponds directly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem based on an analysis of the provided answers.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the chemical equilibrium at play. The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). The goal is to find the equilibrium concentration of the calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The core chemical process is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Use the Correct Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f = 5x10¹⁰), which is for the reverse reaction. The equilibrium expression for formation is:\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** I will use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to define the concentrations of all species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form.\n    *   Initial: [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M, [Ca²⁺] = 0, [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0\n    *   Change: [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x, [Ca²⁺] = +x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   Equilibrium: [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Formulate and Simplify the Equation:** I will substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression. Since K_f is very large, the complex is very stable, and the amount that dissociates ('x') will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). This allows for the valid approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. The equation simplifies to:\n    K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n5.  **Solve with Code:** I will write a Python script to solve this simplified equation for 'x'.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:** The value of 'x' represents the concentration of calcium ions. I will compare this calculated value to the provided options to determine the final answer.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The problem states an \"ideal pH,\" which is a key simplification. It allows us to use the given formation constant directly without correcting for the protonation of EDTA that occurs at lower pH values.\n*   The approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is justified by the very large value of K_f. The final calculation will confirm that x is indeed negligible compared to 0.02.\n*   Several candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to match the numerical result to the correct lettered option.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as CaY²⁻. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, the relevant reaction is the dissociation:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nWe are given the *formation constant* (K_f), which corresponds to the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\nK_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe can work with this expression directly.

Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA very large K_f value (5 x 10¹⁰) indicates that the equilibrium lies heavily in favor of the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).

This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, `Ca²⁺` and `EDTA⁴⁻` (denoted as `Y⁴⁻`). The relevant reaction is the dissociation of the complex:\n`[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻`\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant\nThe problem provides the **formation constant** (`K_f`), which corresponds to the reverse reaction:\n`Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻`\n`K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰`\n\nTo analyze the dissociation, we need the **dissociation constant** (`K_d`), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n`K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹`\n\n### Step 3: Set up an ICE Table\nWe use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations.

This indicates that the complex is very stable and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.

Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   **Initial:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M; [Ca²⁺] = 0 M; [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x; [Ca²⁺] = +x; [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x; [Ca²⁺] = x; [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n5.  **Apply a Valid Approximation:** The formation constant (K_f) is extremely large, indicating the complex is very stable and dissociates very little. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    Rearranging to solve for x:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Match to Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

All candidate answers correctly set up this relationship.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The approximation that the change in the complex's concentration is negligible (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is justified because K_f is very large. The final result (x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷) is indeed much smaller than 0.02, confirming the approximation's validity.\n*   **Significance of \"Ideal pH\":** This condition simplifies the problem by allowing the direct use of the given formation constant. At non-ideal (lower) pH, the free EDTA would exist in various protonated forms (HY³⁻, H₂Y²⁻, etc.), which would require using a conditional formation constant (K_f') that is pH-dependent.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** All 15 candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical value of the Ca²⁺ concentration. However, there were discrepancies in matching this value to the lettered options.

The relevant reaction is:\n    $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the **formation constant** ($K_f$) for the reverse reaction, where the complex is formed:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    The value is given as $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The equilibrium expression for this constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca-EDTA]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is used to track the concentrations.

Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).

All candidate answers correctly identified this relationship.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The approximation `(0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02` is justified by the very large value of $K_f$. The result, $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$, is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02, confirming the approximation was valid.\n*   **The \"Ideal pH\" Assumption:** This is a critical simplification. It allows the direct use of the given formation constant ($K_f$). At a non-ideal (lower) pH, the free EDTA would exist in various protonated forms (e.g., $HY^{3-}$, $H_2Y^{2-}$), which would require using a pH-dependent *conditional formation constant* ($K'_f$) that is smaller than $K_f$. The \"ideal pH\" assumption instructs us to ignore this complication.\n*   **Final Answer Matching:** All 15 candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical value.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻. This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, the relevant reaction is the dissociation:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nWe are given the formation constant (K_f), which corresponds to the formation of the complex:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nAlternatively, we can work directly with the K_f expression, which yields the same result.\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table**\nLet 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. At equilibrium, 'x' will be the concentration of Ca²⁺.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [CaY]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n**4. Write and Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nUsing the formation constant (K_f) expression with the equilibrium concentrations:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**5. Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA very large K_f value (5 x 10¹⁰) indicates that the complex is extremely stable and the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore make the valid approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentration of Calcium Ions**\nThe simplified equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹² or 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**7.

The calculated value of 6.3x10⁻⁷ M corresponds directly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem based on an analysis of the provided answers.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the chemical equilibrium at play. The problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). The goal is to find the equilibrium concentration of the calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The core chemical process is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Use the Correct Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f = 5x10¹⁰), which is for the reverse reaction. The equilibrium expression for formation is:\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** I will use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to define the concentrations of all species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form.\n    *   Initial: [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M, [Ca²⁺] = 0, [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0\n    *   Change: [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x, [Ca²⁺] = +x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   Equilibrium: [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Formulate and Simplify the Equation:** I will substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression. Since K_f is very large, the complex is very stable, and the amount that dissociates ('x') will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). This allows for the valid approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02. The equation simplifies to:\n    K_f ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n5.  **Solve with Code:** I will write a Python script to solve this simplified equation for 'x'.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:** The value of 'x' represents the concentration of calcium ions. I will compare this calculated value to the provided options to determine the final answer.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The problem states an \"ideal pH,\" which is a key simplification. It allows us to use the given formation constant directly without correcting for the protonation of EDTA that occurs at lower pH values.\n*   The approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is justified by the very large value of K_f.

Apply a Simplifying Approximation**\nA very large K_f value (5 x 10¹⁰) indicates that the complex is extremely stable and the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex).

This complex exists in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻). Since we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, the relevant reaction is the dissociation:\n\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2.

This greatly simplifies the problem.\n*   **Approximation Validity:** The approximation (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is justified because $K_f$ is very large. The final result (x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷) is many orders of magnitude smaller than 0.02, confirming the approximation was valid.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly. The discrepancies arose from incorrectly matching the calculated value to the lettered options.

This means we need to analyze the *dissociation* of the complex to find the equilibrium concentration of its components.\n\n2.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:**\n    *   The formation of the complex is: $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca-EDTA]^{2-}$\n    *   The dissociation of the complex, which is the relevant reaction here, is the reverse: $[Ca-EDTA]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:**\n    *   We are given the **formation constant** ($K_f$) = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    *   The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction is the **dissociation constant** ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    *   $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n    *   Alternatively, one can work directly with the $K_f$ expression, ensuring the concentrations are placed correctly (products/reactants).

This indicates the complex is very stable and very little of it will dissociate.\n    *   Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the valid approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n    *   The equation simplifies to: $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Concentration of Calcium Ions (x):**\n    *   $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    *   $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    *   $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    *   $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    This calculation can be verified with a simple script.\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    # Given values\n    initial_conc_complex = 0.02  # M\n    K_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\n    \n    # K_d is the dissociation constant\n    K_d = 1 / K_f\n    \n    # From the approximation K_d ≈ x^2 / initial_conc_complex\n    # We solve for x, where x = [Ca^2+]\n    x_squared = K_d * initial_conc_complex\n    x = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n    \n    print(f\"The calculated concentration of Ca2+ is: {x:.2e} M\")\n    ```\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

The result (x ≈ 6.3x10⁻⁷) is indeed much smaller than 0.02, confirming the approximation's validity.\n*   **\"Ideal pH\":** This assumption is crucial.

Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe problem starts with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻. This complex will dissociate to a small extent to reach equilibrium with its constituent ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. The relevant chemical reaction is the dissociation:\n[CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Equilibrium Constant**\nThe problem provides the *formation constant* (K_f), which corresponds to the reverse reaction:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\nK_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nFor the dissociation reaction, we need the *dissociation constant* (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nAlternatively, one can work directly with the K_f expression, which all methods ultimately do.\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) Table**\nLet 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form at equilibrium. Due to the 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentrations will be as follows:\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [CaY]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Apply Approximations**\nUsing the formation constant expression:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n**Careful Point:** The formation constant (K_f) is extremely large. This indicates the complex is very stable and the equilibrium lies far to the right (favoring the complex). Therefore, the amount that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n**5.

To find the concentration of free calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of this complex. The dissociation reaction is:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Equilibrium Constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f) for the complex, which corresponds to the reverse reaction:\n    K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n    The equilibrium expression for formation is: K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    *   **Initial:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M; [Ca²⁺] = 0 M; [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x; [Ca²⁺] = +x; [EDTA⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:** [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x; [Ca²⁺] = x; [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n5.  **Apply a Valid Approximation:** The formation constant (K_f) is extremely large, indicating the complex is very stable and dissociates very little. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentration:** The simplified equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    Rearranging to solve for x:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Match to Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.

All candidate answers correctly set up this relationship.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** The approximation that the change in the complex's concentration is negligible (0.02 - x ≈ 0.02) is justified because K_f is very large. The final result (x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷) is indeed much smaller than 0.02, confirming the approximation's validity.\n*   **Significance of \"Ideal pH\":** This condition simplifies the problem by allowing the direct use of the given formation constant. At non-ideal (lower) pH, the free EDTA would exist in various protonated forms (HY³⁻, H₂Y²⁻, etc.), which would require using a conditional formation constant (K_f') that is pH-dependent.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** All 15 candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical value of the Ca²⁺ concentration. However, there were discrepancies in matching this value to the lettered options. The correct final step is to match the calculated value of 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M to the corresponding option from the prompt, which is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
