  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nFive binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF=31,96%) and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances. Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\n\nA) 220-240\nB) 110-130\nC) 140-160\nD) 160-180\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues that appear to contradict each other, which is common in advanced chemistry problems designed to test deductive reasoning. The key is to identify the most reliable clues and find the most consistent explanation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe most quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nRearranging for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), with M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for n:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, M=121.8 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, a near-perfect match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for PuF₆ is 31.84%, also a near-perfect match.\n\nThe Pu hypothesis fails because if A2=PuF₆, A1 cannot be a higher fluoride that decomposes to it. The Sb hypothesis fails on several key properties (only two common fluorides, not five; SbF₅ is stable and colorless, not red and unstable). The Krypton hypothesis, while having a slightly larger discrepancy in the mass percentage, aligns best with the chemical reactions described.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the compounds based on Y = Krypton (Kr).**\nThe most specific and unusual clue is the reaction stoichiometry: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... a solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes the reaction: Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n\nLet's consider the known chemistry of Krypton fluorides:\nThe comproportionation reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** is a known reaction that perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants.\n\nThis allows us to make the following identifications:\n*   **Y** = Krypton (Kr)\n*   **A4** = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)\n*   **A5** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)\n\n**Step 3: Verify the other clues with this assignment.**\n*   **A2**: The problem states A2 has ɷF=31.96%. Our A5 is KrF₂, which has ɷF=31.2%. It is highly probable that A2 and A5 are the same compound (KrF₂) and the value in the problem statement is slightly inaccurate. So, **A2 = KrF₂**.\n*   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride. The reaction KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂ fits perfectly. Therefore, **A1 = KrF₄**. This is consistent with our identification of A4.\n*   **A1 and A3 properties**: A1 (KrF₄) and A3 (likely KrF₂) are extremely powerful oxidizing agents and would react with xenon. This fits.\n*   **Contradictions**: This interpretation requires us to accept that the problem contains descriptive errors. A1 (KrF₄) is a white solid, not \"bright-red\". Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides. These types of descriptive errors are common in such puzzles, whereas a specific reaction stoichiometry (1:1) is a much harder clue to ignore.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\nBased on our deduction, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Kr ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the correct range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol. We compare this to the given ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 159.8 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction by evaluating several hypotheses for the identity of element Y. The most crucial pieces of information are the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2, the existence of five binary fluorides, the properties of compound A1, and the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5.\n\n**Step 1: Initial analysis of Element Y based on the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. The formula for the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) in a compound YFₙ is M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n, where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms.\nTesting integer values for 'n' gives several potential candidates for Y:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidate: Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nAnother possibility not immediately obvious from this calculation is Platinum (Pt). If A2 is PtF₅, the mass percentage of fluorine is (5 * 19.00) / (195.08 + 95) = 32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating the candidates against the other chemical clues.**\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: While the mass percentage for SbF₃ is an excellent match (31.88%), this hypothesis fails on several key points. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃ and SbF₅), not five. Also, A1 would have to be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, contradicting the description of a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\".\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: This is a plausible candidate. A1 could be KrF₄, which is unstable and a powerful oxidizer, decomposing into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. However, Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides, and KrF₄ is a white solid, not red. While some reaction pathways fit, the premise of five known compounds is not met.\n*   **Plutonium (Pu) Hypothesis**: This fits the mass percentage well if A2 is PuF₆. However, it fails because solutions of its fluorides are colored, contradicting the \"colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis proves to be the most consistent.\n    1.  **Five binary compounds**: Platinum is known to form five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This perfectly matches the first clue.\n    2.  **Substance A1**: The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" and \"oxidizes xenon\" is a near-perfect match for Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), which is a dark-red solid and one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known.\n    3.  **Substance A2**: If A1 is PtF₆, it can decompose into a lower fluoride. A plausible product is PtF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is 32.75%, which is a close fit to the given 31.96%.\n    4.  **Substances A4 and A5**: The reaction involves adding Y (Pt) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to get A5. This describes a comproportionation reaction. Among the remaining fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), the reaction **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF** fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. This identifies **A4 as PtF₂** and A5 as PtF. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is consistent with the nature of a sub-halide like PtF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\nBased on the most consistent hypothesis, A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol.\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   Molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 * 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex chemistry problem with several clues that can seem contradictory. The key is to find the element Y that provides the most consistent explanation across all the given conditions. After analyzing the different possibilities presented by the candidate answers, the most coherent solution identifies the element Y as Platinum (Pt).\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Element Y**: The primary quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can use the formula `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n` (where n is the number of fluorine atoms) to find potential elements. This points to candidates like Krypton (Kr, n=2), Antimony (Sb, n=3), and Platinum-group or Actinide metals (e.g., Pt, Pu for n=5 or n=6).\n2.  **Test Hypotheses Against All Clues**: We must test each candidate element against the full set of clues:\n    *   **Five binary fluorides**: This is a very strong constraint. Platinum is known to form five (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). Krypton and Antimony do not.\n    *   **Properties of A1**: \"Bright-red,\" decomposes at room temperature, and oxidizes xenon. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a near-perfect match. Other candidates' fluorides do not fit these properties as well.\n    *   **Identity of A2**: If A1 is PtF₆, its decomposition `PtF₆ → A2 + F₂` suggests A2 is a lower fluoride, likely PtF₅. The theoretical ɷF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **The 1:1 Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio is crucial. For Platinum, the reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` fits this 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly. This identifies **A4 as PtF₂** and A5 as PtF.\n    *   **Consistency**: This hypothesis allows A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 to be five distinct, known binary fluorides of platinum (PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), avoiding the contradictions found in other hypotheses (like A1=A4 for Krypton).\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**: Based on the deduction, A4 is platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂). We will calculate its molecular weight.\n4.  **Select the Correct Range**: Compare the calculated molecular weight to the given options to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry puzzle by identifying element Y as Platinum\n    and then calculating the molecular weight of compound A4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Deduce the identity of the element and compounds.\n    # Based on the analysis of all clues (five binary fluorides, properties of A1,\n    # and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry), the most consistent hypothesis is:\n    # Element Y = Platinum (Pt)\n    # Compound A1 = PtF6\n    # Compound A2 = PtF5\n    # Compound A4 = PtF2 (from the reaction Pt + PtF2 -> 2PtF)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 (PtF2).\n    # Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt)\n    M_Pt = 195.08  # g/mol\n    # Atomic weight of Fluorine (F)\n    M_F = 19.00   # g/mol\n\n    # Molecular weight of A4 (PtF2) = M(Pt) + 2 * M(F)\n    mw_A4 = M_Pt + 2 * M_F\n\n    # Step 4: Select the correct range for the calculated molecular weight.\n    print(\"Step-by-step deduction:\")\n    print(\"1.

The formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.0 g/mol), M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (19.0 × n) / (M(Y) + 19.0 × n)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 2 = 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for KrF₂: (2×19) / (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable fit.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.8 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3×19) / (121.8 + 57) = 31.88%. This is an excellent fit.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for PuF₆: (6×19) / (244 + 114) = 31.84%. This is also an excellent fit.\n\nWe have three strong candidates for Y: Krypton, Antimony, and Plutonium.\n\n**Step 2: Use the chemical properties to distinguish between the candidates.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine (A1 → A2 + F₂).**\n    *   If Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆. A1 would have to be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF₇), which is not known to exist. This makes Pu unlikely.\n    *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF₃. A1 would be SbF₅. The reaction is SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. However, SbF₅ is a stable liquid at room temperature, not a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes. This contradicts the problem's description.\n    *   If Y=Kr, A2=KrF₂. A1 would be KrF₄. The reaction is KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂. KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable and decomposes at or below room temperature. This fits the decomposition clue perfectly. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an error in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is a white solid.\n\n*   **Clue 2: By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained (Y + A4 → A5).**\n    *   If Y=Sb, the most plausible reaction involving Sb metal is the comproportionation: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. Here, A4 would be SbF₅. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, which contradicts the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   If Y=Kr, let's test possible reactions. A very plausible reaction that fits the 1:1 stoichiometry is: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**. In this case, Y is Kr, A4 is KrF₄, and A5 is KrF₂. This reaction perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the identities of the compounds and find A4.**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides the most chemically consistent narrative, especially for the reaction steps, despite the minor discrepancy in mass percentage and the incorrect color description for A1.\n*   **Y** = Krypton (Kr)\n*   **A1** = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)\n*   **A2** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)\n*   **A3** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) (formed by fluorination of Kr, reacts with Xe)\n*   **A4** = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) (from the 1:1 reaction with Kr)\n*   **A5** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) (the product of the 1:1 reaction)\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight of substance A4. Based on our deduction, A4 is KrF₄.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = MW(KrF₄)\n*   MW(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.8 g/mol\n\nNow, we check which range this value falls into:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) is:\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) × (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF\nM(Y) ≈ (n × 19.00 × 0.6804) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find plausible elements that form multiple fluorides:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%. This is a possibility.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%. This is an excellent numerical match.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). ɷF for PuF₆ is 31.84%. This is also an excellent numerical match.\n\nWe must now use the other chemical clues to distinguish between these possibilities. The most promising candidates based on the richness of their fluoride chemistry are Kr, Sb, and Pu. Let's also consider Platinum (Pt), which is famous for its fluorides.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates against the other clues.**\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** Only two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) are known. This is a major contradiction.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Only KrF₂ is well-established; KrF₄ is highly unstable/disputed. This contradicts the clue.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆ are known. This fits well.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆ are known. This fits perfectly.\n\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** If Y=Pt, then A1 is likely PtF₆. Platinum hexafluoride is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** If Y=Pu, A1 would be a higher fluoride than A2=PuF₆ (e.g., PuF₈), which is not known to exist. This is a major contradiction.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** If Y=Kr, A1 would be KrF₄. KrF₄ is a white solid, not red. This is a major contradiction.\n\nBased on these clues, **Platinum (Pt) is by far the most likely candidate for element Y.**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Platinum Fluorides (A1-A5).**\nLet's build the full story with Y = Pt.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆**: Matches the description of a red, unstable solid that oxidizes xenon.\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. A plausible product is PtF₅. Let's check the mass percentage: ɷF(PtF₅) = (5 * 19) / (195.08 + 95) = 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96% (a 2.5% relative error, which is common in such problems).\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Pt and reacts with Xe. This could be PtF₄ or PtF₆.\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Pt) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction: Pt + A4 → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction. A plausible reaction with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is:\n    Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF\n    This reaction fits the stoichiometry perfectly.\n*   This identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n*   **Final Clue**: \"In water, A5 decomposes\". A5=PtF, a sub-fluoride, would certainly be unstable in water.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\nBased on the deduction, A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n*   Molar Mass of Pt ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 233.08 g/mol. We compare this to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction, using each piece of information to narrow down the possibilities. The most critical clues are the mass percentage of fluorine in A2, the existence of five binary fluorides, the properties of A1, and the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 (formula YFₙ) is 31.96%. The molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) can be related to the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula:\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) × (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF\nM(Y) ≈ (n × 19.00 × 0.6804) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can test integer values of n to find plausible elements:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). ɷF for PuF₆ is 31.84%.\n\nWhile Sb provides an excellent numerical fit, it fails on other chemical clues (it only has two common fluorides, not five, and its properties do not match A1). The Krypton and Plutonium/Platinum group hypotheses are more promising.\n\n**Step 2: Use the \"Five Binary Compounds\" and A1's Properties**\n\n*   The problem states that **five binary compounds** of fluorine with Y are known. This is a very strong clue. Platinum (Pt) is known to form five: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. Krypton is only known to form one stable fluoride (KrF₂) and one very unstable one (KrF₄), failing this condition.\n*   A1 is a **bright-red substance** that **decomposes at 293 K** and **oxidizes xenon**. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for A1.\n\n**Step 3: Identify All Five Compounds (A1-A5)**\n\nAssuming Y is Platinum (Pt), we can deduce the identities of all five compounds:\n*   **A1 = PtF₆**: Matches the color, instability, and extreme oxidizing power.\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The reaction is PtF₆ → A2 + F₂. The logical product is PtF₅. Let's check the mass percentage for PtF₅: ɷF = (5 × 19.00) / (195.08 + 5 × 19.00) = 95 / 290.08 ≈ 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the small discrepancy is acceptable given how well all other clues fit.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Pt and reacts with xenon. This could be PtF₄ or PtF₆. As A1 is PtF₆, A3 is likely **PtF₄**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: We are left with PtF₂ and PtF. The reaction is Y + A4 → A5 in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The only reaction that fits this stoichiometry is:\n    Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF\n    This reaction is not standard but fits the 1:1 ratio constraint perfectly if we consider the product is two moles of A5. This identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n*   **Final Clue**: A5 (PtF) decomposes in water. As a sub-halide, this is chemically expected.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that satisfies all the major constraints of the problem: the existence of five distinct compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the deduction, substance A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n*   Molar Mass of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = M(Pt) + 2 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 195.08 + 2 × 19.00 = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe correct range is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ωF - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol). The calculated ωF for KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, M=121.8 g/mol). The calculated ωF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is extremely close to 31.96%.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol). The calculated ωF for PuF₆ is 31.84%.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n\nThe most decisive clue is the reaction used to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: The only plausible comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This would identify Y=Sb, A4=SbF₅, and A5=SbF₃. However, the molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, which contradicts the 1:1 ratio given in the problem. Furthermore, Sb only has two common fluorides, not five, and SbF₅ is a stable colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. This hypothesis has too many contradictions.\n\n*   **Plutonium (Pu) Hypothesis**: While the mass percentage fits well, the known reactions for plutonium fluorides do not fit a 1:1 molar ratio for comproportionation. For example, `Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃`. This hypothesis is unlikely.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: Let's test the chemical properties if Y=Kr.\n    *   **A2 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This identifies **A1 = KrF₄**. The reaction is `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable at room temperature (293 K) and is a powerful oxidizing agent that would react with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an error in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is a colorless solid.\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y (Kr) and interacts with xenon. This is consistent with **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **Reaction for A4 and A5**: The reaction is `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio. The known reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` fits this 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n    *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   The final clue states A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water, which is correct as it hydrolyzes readily.\n\nThis Krypton-based solution provides the most chemically consistent narrative, especially regarding the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry, despite minor inconsistencies in the descriptive text (color, number of compounds).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nBased on the most consistent deduction, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n*   MW(A4) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct range.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe correct range is 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most consistent solution.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine (ɷF) in A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) with ɷF = 31.96%. The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula:\n    M(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\n    M(Y) ≈ (n × 19.0 / 0.3196) - (n × 19.0)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We must test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible element:\n    *   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 2 = 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Krypton (Kr)**, which is 83.8 g/mol. The calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is (2×19)/121.8 = 31.2%, which is a reasonable match.\n    *   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. The calculated ɷF for SbF₃ is (3×19)/178.76 = 31.88%, a near-perfect match.\n    *   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Plutonium (Pu)**, which is ~244 g/mol. The calculated ɷF for PuF₆ is (6×19)/358 = 31.84%, also a near-perfect match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n    The most decisive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a reaction with a specific 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) Path**: While the mass percentage fit is excellent, this path fails on multiple chemical properties. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. A1 would be SbF₅, which is a stable colorless liquid, not an unstable bright-red solid. Most importantly, the reaction between Sb and its fluorides does not have a 1:1 stoichiometry (the known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃). This path has too many contradictions.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu) Path**: This path also has an excellent mass percentage fit. However, if A2 is PuF₆, then A1 must be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF₈), which is not a well-established compound. This makes the initial decomposition step problematic.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) Path**: This path provides the most coherent explanation, especially for the 1:1 reaction.\n        *   **A1** decomposes into **A2** and fluorine: This fits the reaction **KrF₄ (A1) → KrF₂ (A2) + F₂**. KrF₄ is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K).\n        *   **A1** and **A3** oxidize xenon: Both KrF₄ and KrF₂ are exceptionally strong oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon.\n        *   **1:1 Reaction**: The reaction **Kr (Y) + KrF₄ (A4) → 2KrF₂ (A5)** fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly. This is a known, albeit not common, comproportionation reaction. This provides a clear identity for A4 and A5.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight.**\n    Based on the Krypton path, which best explains the specific 1:1 stoichiometry, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 ≈ 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\nWhile the problem contains inconsistencies (Krypton does not have five well-known binary fluorides, and KrF₄ is a white solid, not red), the Krypton hypothesis provides the most logical and consistent explanation for the most specific chemical clues, particularly the decomposition reaction and the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the provided candidate solutions and the problem's constraints.\n\n**1. Analyze the Core Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Mass Percentage of A2.** A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The molar mass of Y can be estimated with the formula M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n*   **Clue 2: Number of Compounds.** Five binary fluorides of Y are known.\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1.** A1 is bright-red, decomposes at room temperature (293 K) into A2 and F₂, and oxidizes xenon. This implies A1 is a highly unstable, powerful oxidizing agent with a higher fluorine content than A2.\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Reaction.** The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a strong hint for a specific type of comproportionation reaction.\n*   **Clue 5: Properties of A4.** A4 is used in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n\n**2. Evaluate the Main Hypotheses from the Candidate Answers**\n\nThere are three primary candidates for element Y: Antimony (Sb), Krypton (Kr), and Platinum (Pt).\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis (Answers 3, 4, 5):**\n    *   **Pro:** The mass percentage calculation for A2=SbF₃ (31.88%) is an almost perfect match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Cons:** This hypothesis fails on nearly every other point.\n        *   Antimony only has two common binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five.\n        *   A1 would be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at 293 K.\n        *   There is no known 1:1 reaction for `Sb + A4 -> A5`. The actual reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`, which has a 2:3 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The excellent mass percentage match is likely a deliberate misdirection. The chemical inconsistencies are too severe.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis (Answers 1, 6, 7):**\n    *   **Pros:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂` fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly (identifying A4=KrF₄, A5=KrF₂). The properties of A1 (unstable, oxidizes Xe) are a good fit for KrF₄.\n    *   **Cons:**\n        *   The mass percentage for A2=KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is a noticeable deviation from 31.96%.\n        *   Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n        *   The physical properties are wrong: KrF₄ is a white solid, not a \"bright-red\" substance (A1) or something that forms a \"solution\" (A4).\n        *   This hypothesis identifies A1 and A4 as the same compound, and A2, A3, and A5 as the same compound, which seems unlikely.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While the 1:1 reaction is elegant, this path has multiple significant flaws. If A4=KrF₄, its MW is ~160 g/mol (Range C).\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis (Answer 2):**\n    *   **Pros:**\n        *   Platinum is known to form five binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆), perfectly matching Clue 2.\n        *   A1=PtF₆ is a dark-red solid, one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known (it was famously used to oxidize xenon), and is thermally unstable. This is an excellent match for Clue 3.\n        *   The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ -> 2PtF` is a known comproportionation that fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly (identifying A4=PtF₂, A5=PtF). This matches Clue 4.\n    *   **Cons:**\n        *   The mass percentage for A2=PtF₅ (the likely decomposition product of PtF₆) is 32.75%, which is a reasonable but not perfect match for 31.96%.\n        *   A4=PtF₂ is a yellowish-green insoluble solid, which contradicts the \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This hypothesis provides the most chemically consistent story. It correctly accounts for the number of compounds, the specific properties of the powerful oxidant A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The only significant flaw is the physical description of the A4 solution, which is a very common type of red herring or simplification in complex chemistry problems.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the most robust. It aligns with the majority of the chemical principles and specific numerical constraints given in the problem. The inconsistencies in the other hypotheses are more fundamental (e.g., incorrect stoichiometry, non-existence of compounds).\n\nLet's finalize the identification based on the Platinum hypothesis:\n*   Y = Platinum (Pt)\n*   A1 = PtF₆\n*   A2 = PtF₅ (decomposition product)\n*   A3 = PtF₄ (another fluoride)\n*   **A4 = PtF₂** (reactant in the 1:1 reaction)\n*   A5 = PtF (product of the 1:1 reaction)\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance **A4**.\n*   A4 = PtF₂\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of PtF₂ = M(Pt) + 2 * M(F)\n*   MW(PtF₂) ≈ 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**\n\nThis value falls squarely within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction, evaluating multiple hypotheses against a set of clues. Several clues appear to be contradictory, which is common in such problems, forcing a decision on which pieces of evidence are most reliable.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most quantitative clue is that substance A2, a binary fluoride of element Y (YFₙ), has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nWhere M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nRearranging to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = (n × 19.00 × (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   Let's check the ɷF for KrF₂: (2×19) / (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3×19) / (121.8 + 57) = 31.9%. This is an excellent match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n    *   Let's check the ɷF for PuF₆: (6×19) / (244 + 114) = 31.8%. This is also an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Hypotheses (Kr, Sb, Pu) against Other Clues**\n\nWe must now test these three possibilities against the other clues, especially the reaction stoichiometry and chemical properties.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**:\n    *   Fails on the \"five binary compounds\" clue (only SbF₃ and SbF₅ are common).\n    *   Fails on the properties of A1. A1 would be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\".\n    *   Fails on the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The reaction Sb + SbF₅ -> SbF₃ has a 2:3 ratio.\n    *   This hypothesis is chemically inconsistent despite the excellent mass percentage match.\n\n*   **Plutonium (Pu) Hypothesis**:\n    *   Fits the \"five binary compounds\" clue well.\n    *   The reaction `Pu + A4 -> A5` would be a comproportionation (e.g., `Pu + 3PuF₄ -> 4PuF₃`), but the 1:1 stoichiometry is not met.\n    *   If A4 were PuF₄, its molecular weight would be ~320 g/mol, which is not in any of the answer ranges.\n    *   This hypothesis leads to a dead end.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**:\n    *   **A1/A2/A3**: A1 decomposes to A2 and F₂. This fits A1=KrF₄ and A2=KrF₂. Both KrF₄ and KrF₂ (A3) are extremely powerful oxidizing agents that would react with Xenon. The instability of A1 (KrF₄) at room temperature (293 K) is also correct. The \"bright-red\" color is a known inaccuracy in this classic problem statement; KrF₄ is a colorless solid.\n    *   **A4/A5 Reaction**: The clue states `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂` is a known type of comproportionation that fits the 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n    *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **Properties of A4**: A4 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, so a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" (e.g., in a suitable non-aqueous solvent like HF) is plausible.\n    *   **Properties of A5**: A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water, which is correct.\n    *   This hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation, especially for the crucial 1:1 stoichiometry, by assuming the descriptive clues (color, number of compounds) are less reliable than the reaction data.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Range**\n\nBased on the most consistent hypothesis, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight falls squarely within the range **140-160**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Potential Candidates for Element Y**\n\nThe most crucial piece of quantitative information is that substance A2, a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ), has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nWe can use the formula for mass percentage to estimate the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n0.3196 = (n × 19.0) / (M(Y) + n × 19.0)\n\nRearranging the formula gives: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nLet's test plausible integer values for n:\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nWe have three main candidates for Y: Krypton, Antimony, and Plutonium.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Against the Reaction Clues**\n\nThe problem describes several chemical reactions. The most specific and restrictive clue is the reaction to form A5:\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)**.\n\nLet's test our candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The reaction would be a comproportionation between Sb(0) and a higher fluoride like SbF₅. The balanced chemical equation is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The molar ratio of Y (Sb) to A4 (SbF₅) is 2:3, which is not 1:1. Therefore, Antimony is incorrect.\n*   **Plutonium (Pu):** A plausible comproportionation reaction is Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃. The molar ratio is 1:3, not 1:1. Therefore, Plutonium is incorrect.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Let's consider the comproportionation reaction between Krypton and its higher fluoride, Krypton tetrafluoride: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**. In this reaction, 1 mole of Y (Kr) reacts with 1 mole of A4 (KrF₄). **This is a perfect 1:1 molar ratio.**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis is the only one that satisfies this critical stoichiometric requirement.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the Identities of the Compounds**\n\nBased on the Krypton hypothesis, we can identify the substances:\n*   **Y = Kr** (Krypton)\n*   **A4 = KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride), from the 1:1 reaction.\n*   **A5 = KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride), the product of the reaction.\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The reaction KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂ fits this. So, **A1 = KrF₄** and **A2 = KrF₂**.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂) and reacts with xenon. This identifies **A3 = KrF₂**.\n\nThis set of identifications is chemically consistent, even if some descriptive details in the problem (like the \"bright-red\" color of A1) are inaccurate, which is common in such puzzles.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Atomic Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Atomic Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls into the range given in option C.\n*   A) 220-240\n*   B) 110-130\n*   C) 140-160\n*   D) 160-180\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Quantitative Clue (Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2)**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can calculate the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) as a function of n (the number of fluorine atoms).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nRearranging for M(Y): M(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\nUsing M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196:\nM(Y) ≈ n × 19.0 × (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ n × 40.45 g/mol\n\nLet's test integer values of n:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8). ɷF(KrF₂) = 31.2%. (Fair match)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8). ɷF(SbF₃) = 31.88%. (Excellent match)\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Close to Plutonium (Pu, 244). ɷF(PuF₆) = 31.84%. (Excellent match)\n\nThe excellent numerical match for Antimony (Sb) is tempting, but it leads to major chemical contradictions (only two fluorides, not five; properties of SbF₅ do not match A1; reaction stoichiometry fails). The Plutonium path also fails to produce a molecular weight for A4 that fits any of the options. This suggests the precise mass percentage might be a red herring, or there's a typo in the problem, and we should rely more on the qualitative chemical clues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Qualitative Clues**\n\n1.  **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This strongly suggests a transition metal or a heavy element. Platinum (Pt) and Plutonium (Pu) are excellent candidates. Krypton (Kr) and Antimony (Sb) are poor candidates.\n2.  **\"The bright-red substance A1 ... oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** This is a very specific and powerful clue. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a famous dark-red solid and is one of the few substances capable of oxidizing xenon, which led to the discovery of noble gas compounds. This makes **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆** a very strong hypothesis.\n3.  **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine.\"** PtF₆ is known to be thermally unstable and can decompose to lower fluorides. The reaction PtF₆ → PtF₅ + F is known. This would make **A2 = PtF₅**. Let's check the mass percentage for PtF₅: ɷF = (5×19)/(195.08 + 5×19) = 95/290.08 ≈ 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the discrepancy is acceptable given the strength of the other clues.\n4.  **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes the reaction: Pt + A4 → A5. The 1:1 stoichiometry is key. The known fluorides of platinum are PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, and PtF. We have already assigned A1=PtF₆ and A2=PtF₅. A plausible comproportionation reaction involving the remaining fluorides that fits a 1:1 ratio is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n    This reaction perfectly fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Y and A4).\n5.  **Identify A4 and A5.** From the reaction above, we can identify **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is consistent with the nature of a sub-halide like PtF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Range**\n\nBased on the consistent line of reasoning above, substance A4 is platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = M(Pt) + 2 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 195.08 + 2 × 19.00 = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**\n\nNow, we check which range this value falls into:\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided chemical clues, the most consistent identification for element Y is Platinum (Pt). This conclusion allows for the logical identification of the unknown substances and the determination of the molecular weight of A4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y**: The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. This points to an element with a rich fluoride chemistry. Furthermore, substance A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\". This is a very strong clue. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon, as demonstrated by Neil Bartlett in 1962. This makes Platinum (Pt) a very strong candidate for element Y.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A1 and A2**:\n    *   **A1**: Based on the properties above, A1 is **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. It is a dark-red, volatile solid and one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known.\n    *   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. This implies A2 is a lower fluoride of platinum. A plausible decomposition product is Platinum pentafluoride (PtF₅). Let's check the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in PtF₅. The molar mass of PtF₅ is approximately 290.08 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (5 * 19.00) / 290.08 ≈ 32.75%. This value is reasonably close to the 31.96% given in the problem, with the small discrepancy likely being an acceptable error in the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Pt) and also interacts with xenon. Direct fluorination of platinum can produce several fluorides, including PtF₄ and PtF₆. Both are strong oxidizing agents. This is consistent with our identification.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5**: The key reaction is the addition of Y (Pt) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to yield A5 (`Y + A4 → A5`). This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in oxidation state 0 reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state.\n    *   The known binary fluorides of platinum are PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, and PtF.\n    *   We have assigned A1=PtF₆ and A2=PtF₅. The remaining candidates for A4 and A5 are PtF₄, PtF₂, and PtF.\n    *   A reaction that fits the 1:1 molar ratio is: **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**.\n    *   This reaction identifies **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂) and A5 as Platinum(I) fluoride (PtF)**.\n    *   The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is chemically sound for a sub-halide like PtF.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    *   From the deduction above, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n    *   The molecular weight is the sum of the atomic weights of its constituent atoms: M(Pt) + 2 * M(F).\n    *   Using the atomic weight of Platinum (≈195.08 g/mol) and Fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol), the molecular weight of PtF₂ is 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful step-by-step deduction, weighing chemical plausibility against numerical data. Several clues seem contradictory, which is common in complex chemical puzzles, forcing a decision on which clues are most reliable.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine (ɷF) in A2.**\n    The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine in a compound YFₙ is:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    Given ɷF = 31.96% (0.3196) and M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, we can solve for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for KrF₂: (2×19) / (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable fit.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3×19) / (121.76 + 57) = 31.88%. This is an excellent numerical fit.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for PuF₆: (6×19) / (244 + 114) = 31.84%. This is also an excellent fit.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n    The most decisive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) hypothesis:** The main fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The most plausible reaction involving Sb metal is the comproportionation: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This reaction does not have a 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis fails on the stoichiometry.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu) hypothesis:** Plutonium has a rich fluoride chemistry. A plausible comproportionation is 3PuF₄ + Pu → 4PuF₃. This reaction does not have a 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis also fails on the stoichiometry.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) hypothesis:** Let's examine the reactions of Krypton fluorides. A known reaction is the formation of Krypton difluoride from Krypton and Krypton tetrafluoride: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**. This reaction has a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants (Y and A4). This is a very strong indication that Y is Krypton.\n\n3.  **Identify all compounds based on the Krypton hypothesis.**\n    *   **Y = Krypton (Kr)**\n    *   The reaction is Kr (Y) + KrF₄ (A4) → 2KrF₂ (A5).\n    *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   Let's check the other clues. A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. If A1 is KrF₄, it would decompose into a lower fluoride and F₂. However, our reaction identifies A4 as KrF₄. Let's re-read: \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine\". This means A1 → A2 + F₂. The reaction Kr + A4 → A5 is separate.\n    *   Let's assume the most unstable fluoride is A1. So, **A1 = KrF₄**. It decomposes via KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂. This makes **A2 = KrF₂**.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂) and reacts with Xenon. This makes **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   This leaves the reaction Y + A4 → A5. We have identified all plausible compounds (KrF₂, KrF₄). If A4 is KrF₂, the reaction Kr + KrF₂ is unlikely. If A4 is KrF₄, the reaction Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂ fits the 1:1 ratio perfectly. This means **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   This assignment is consistent: A2, A3, and A5 are all KrF₂, while A1 and A4 are KrF₄. The problem states five compounds are *known*, not that A1-A5 are all different. The inconsistencies (the \"bright-red\" color for KrF₄, the \"five compounds\" rule for Kr) are likely deliberate flaws in the problem statement, which is common. The 1:1 stoichiometry is the most specific and restrictive chemical clue.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the deduction, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   Molar mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory. A step-by-step analysis, prioritizing the quantitative information, leads to the most logical solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol), M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy)\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu)\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for SbF₃:\nM(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis is a near-perfect match to the given 31.96%, making Antimony the most likely candidate for element Y, and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the other clues based on Y = Sb.**\n*   **\"Five binary compounds...\"**: Antimony is primarily known for two fluorides, SbF₃ and SbF₅. This clue appears to be incorrect or misleading, a common feature in such puzzle-like problems.\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, so **A1 = SbF₅**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the properties of SbF₅ (a stable, colorless liquid). This is another likely inaccuracy in the problem statement.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and oxidizes xenon. This also points to the most powerful fluorinating agent of antimony, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The key reaction is \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   The available fluorides for A4 are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction is a comproportionation: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This reaction is well-known, but the molar ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is Sb + SbF₃ → A5. While chemically unusual, the stoichiometry is exactly 1:1 as stated in the problem. Given the other inconsistencies, it is most probable that we are meant to strictly follow the 1:1 ratio clue.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and calculate its molecular weight.**\nBased on the 1:1 molar ratio clue, we must identify **A4 as SbF₃**.\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is:\nMW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) ≈ 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe correct range is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Krypton and Antimony do not have five well-established binary fluorides. This strongly favors Platinum.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**: A1 is a \"bright-red substance,\" \"decomposes at 293 K,\" and \"oxidizes xenon.\" This description is a near-perfect match for Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), a dark-red solid famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon and known for its thermal instability.

This is a crucial stoichiometric clue.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: Fails because Sb does not have five fluorides, SbF₅ does not match the properties of A1, and the known reaction `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃` does not have a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: While the reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly fits the 1:1 ratio, this hypothesis fails on two major points: Krypton does not have five known fluorides, and A1 (KrF₄) is a white solid, not red.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis aligns with the most specific and reliable clues.\n    1.  It satisfies the \"five binary compounds\" rule.\n    2.  A1=PtF₆ is a perfect match for the described properties.\n    3.

The key is to identify the most reliable clues and find the most consistent explanation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe most quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nRearranging for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), with M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for n:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, M=121.8 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, a near-perfect match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol). The calculated ɷF for PuF₆ is 31.84%, also a near-perfect match.\n\nThe Pu hypothesis fails because if A2=PuF₆, A1 cannot be a higher fluoride that decomposes to it. The Sb hypothesis fails on several key properties (only two common fluorides, not five; SbF₅ is stable and colorless, not red and unstable). The Krypton hypothesis, while having a slightly larger discrepancy in the mass percentage, aligns best with the chemical reactions described.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the compounds based on Y = Krypton (Kr).**\nThe most specific and unusual clue is the reaction stoichiometry: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... a solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes the reaction: Y + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio of reactants).\n\nLet's consider the known chemistry of Krypton fluorides:\nThe comproportionation reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** is a known reaction that perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants.\n\nThis allows us to make the following identifications:\n*   **Y** = Krypton (Kr)\n*   **A4** = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)\n*   **A5** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)\n\n**Step 3: Verify the other clues with this assignment.**\n*   **A2**: The problem states A2 has ɷF=31.96%. Our A5 is KrF₂, which has ɷF=31.2%. It is highly probable that A2 and A5 are the same compound (KrF₂) and the value in the problem statement is slightly inaccurate. So, **A2 = KrF₂**.\n*   **A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride. The reaction KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂ fits perfectly. Therefore, **A1 = KrF₄**. This is consistent with our identification of A4.\n*   **A1 and A3 properties**: A1 (KrF₄) and A3 (likely KrF₂) are extremely powerful oxidizing agents and would react with xenon. This fits.\n*   **Contradictions**: This interpretation requires us to accept that the problem contains descriptive errors. A1 (KrF₄) is a white solid, not \"bright-red\". Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides. These types of descriptive errors are common in such puzzles, whereas a specific reaction stoichiometry (1:1) is a much harder clue to ignore.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\nBased on our deduction, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Kr ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the correct range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol. We compare this to the given ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 159.8 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction by evaluating several hypotheses for the identity of element Y. The most crucial pieces of information are the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2, the existence of five binary fluorides, the properties of compound A1, and the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5.\n\n**Step 1: Initial analysis of Element Y based on the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. The formula for the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) in a compound YFₙ is M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n, where 'n' is the number of fluorine atoms.\nTesting integer values for 'n' gives several potential candidates for Y:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidate: Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidate: Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nAnother possibility not immediately obvious from this calculation is Platinum (Pt). If A2 is PtF₅, the mass percentage of fluorine is (5 * 19.00) / (195.08 + 95) = 32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating the candidates against the other chemical clues.**\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: While the mass percentage for SbF₃ is an excellent match (31.88%), this hypothesis fails on several key points. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃ and SbF₅), not five. Also, A1 would have to be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, contradicting the description of a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\".\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: This is a plausible candidate. A1 could be KrF₄, which is unstable and a powerful oxidizer, decomposing into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. However, Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides, and KrF₄ is a white solid, not red. While some reaction pathways fit, the premise of five known compounds is not met.\n*   **Plutonium (Pu) Hypothesis**: This fits the mass percentage well if A2 is PuF₆. However, it fails because solutions of its fluorides are colored, contradicting the \"colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis**: This hypothesis proves to be the most consistent.\n    1.  **Five binary compounds**: Platinum is known to form five binary fluorides: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. This perfectly matches the first clue.\n    2.  **Substance A1**: The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" and \"oxidizes xenon\" is a near-perfect match for Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), which is a dark-red solid and one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known.\n    3.  **Substance A2**: If A1 is PtF₆, it can decompose into a lower fluoride. A plausible product is PtF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ is 32.75%, which is a close fit to the given 31.96%.\n    4.  **Substances A4 and A5**: The reaction involves adding Y (Pt) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to get A5. This describes a comproportionation reaction. Among the remaining fluorides (PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), the reaction **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF** fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. This identifies **A4 as PtF₂** and A5 as PtF. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is consistent with the nature of a sub-halide like PtF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\nBased on the most consistent hypothesis, A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n*   Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol.\n*   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n*   Molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + (2 * 19.00) = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex chemistry problem with several clues that can seem contradictory. The key is to find the element Y that provides the most consistent explanation across all the given conditions. After analyzing the different possibilities presented by the candidate answers, the most coherent solution identifies the element Y as Platinum (Pt).\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Element Y**: The primary quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can use the formula `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n` (where n is the number of fluorine atoms) to find potential elements. This points to candidates like Krypton (Kr, n=2), Antimony (Sb, n=3), and Platinum-group or Actinide metals (e.g., Pt, Pu for n=5 or n=6).\n2.  **Test Hypotheses Against All Clues**: We must test each candidate element against the full set of clues:\n    *   **Five binary fluorides**: This is a very strong constraint. Platinum is known to form five (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). Krypton and Antimony do not.\n    *   **Properties of A1**: \"Bright-red,\" decomposes at room temperature, and oxidizes xenon. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a near-perfect match. Other candidates' fluorides do not fit these properties as well.\n    *   **Identity of A2**: If A1 is PtF₆, its decomposition `PtF₆ → A2 + F₂` suggests A2 is a lower fluoride, likely PtF₅. The theoretical ɷF for PtF₅ is ~32.75%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **The 1:1 Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio is crucial. For Platinum, the reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` fits this 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly. This identifies **A4 as PtF₂** and A5 as PtF.\n    *   **Consistency**: This hypothesis allows A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 to be five distinct, known binary fluorides of platinum (PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, PtF), avoiding the contradictions found in other hypotheses (like A1=A4 for Krypton).\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**: Based on the deduction, A4 is platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂). We will calculate its molecular weight.\n4.  **Select the Correct Range**: Compare the calculated molecular weight to the given options to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemistry puzzle by identifying element Y as Platinum\n    and then calculating the molecular weight of compound A4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Deduce the identity of the element and compounds.\n    # Based on the analysis of all clues (five binary fluorides, properties of A1,\n    # and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry), the most consistent hypothesis is:\n    # Element Y = Platinum (Pt)\n    # Compound A1 = PtF6\n    # Compound A2 = PtF5\n    # Compound A4 = PtF2 (from the reaction Pt + PtF2 -> 2PtF)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 (PtF2).\n    # Atomic weight of Platinum (Pt)\n    M_Pt = 195.08  # g/mol\n    # Atomic weight of Fluorine (F)\n    M_F = 19.00   # g/mol\n\n    # Molecular weight of A4 (PtF2) = M(Pt) + 2 * M(F)\n    mw_A4 = M_Pt + 2 * M_F\n\n    # Step 4: Select the correct range for the calculated molecular weight.\n    print(\"Step-by-step deduction:\")\n    print(\"1.

The formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.0 g/mol), M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (19.0 × n) / (M(Y) + 19.0 × n)\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 2 = 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for KrF₂: (2×19) / (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable fit.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.8 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3×19) / (121.8 + 57) = 31.88%. This is an excellent fit.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, M ≈ 244 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for PuF₆: (6×19) / (244 + 114) = 31.84%. This is also an excellent fit.\n\nWe have three strong candidates for Y: Krypton, Antimony, and Plutonium.\n\n**Step 2: Use the chemical properties to distinguish between the candidates.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine (A1 → A2 + F₂).**\n    *   If Y=Pu, A2=PuF₆. A1 would have to be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF₇), which is not known to exist. This makes Pu unlikely.\n    *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF₃. A1 would be SbF₅. The reaction is SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂. However, SbF₅ is a stable liquid at room temperature, not a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes. This contradicts the problem's description.\n    *   If Y=Kr, A2=KrF₂. A1 would be KrF₄. The reaction is KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂. KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable and decomposes at or below room temperature. This fits the decomposition clue perfectly. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an error in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is a white solid.\n\n*   **Clue 2: By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained (Y + A4 → A5).**\n    *   If Y=Sb, the most plausible reaction involving Sb metal is the comproportionation: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. Here, A4 would be SbF₅. The molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, which contradicts the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n    *   If Y=Kr, let's test possible reactions. A very plausible reaction that fits the 1:1 stoichiometry is: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**. In this case, Y is Kr, A4 is KrF₄, and A5 is KrF₂. This reaction perfectly matches the 1:1 molar ratio clue.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the identities of the compounds and find A4.**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides the most chemically consistent narrative, especially for the reaction steps, despite the minor discrepancy in mass percentage and the incorrect color description for A1.\n*   **Y** = Krypton (Kr)\n*   **A1** = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)\n*   **A2** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)\n*   **A3** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) (formed by fluorination of Kr, reacts with Xe)\n*   **A4** = Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) (from the 1:1 reaction with Kr)\n*   **A5** = Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) (the product of the 1:1 reaction)\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight of substance A4. Based on our deduction, A4 is KrF₄.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = MW(KrF₄)\n*   MW(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.8 g/mol\n\nNow, we check which range this value falls into:\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) is:\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) × (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF\nM(Y) ≈ (n × 19.00 × 0.6804) / 0.3196 ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find plausible elements that form multiple fluorides:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%. This is a possibility.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%. This is an excellent numerical match.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). ɷF for PuF₆ is 31.84%. This is also an excellent numerical match.\n\nWe must now use the other chemical clues to distinguish between these possibilities. The most promising candidates based on the richness of their fluoride chemistry are Kr, Sb, and Pu. Let's also consider Platinum (Pt), which is famous for its fluorides.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates against the other clues.**\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** Only two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅) are known. This is a major contradiction.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Only KrF₂ is well-established; KrF₄ is highly unstable/disputed. This contradicts the clue.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆ are known. This fits well.\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆ are known. This fits perfectly.\n\n*   **Clue: \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K... and oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   **Platinum (Pt):** If Y=Pt, then A1 is likely PtF₆. Platinum hexafluoride is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu):** If Y=Pu, A1 would be a higher fluoride than A2=PuF₆ (e.g., PuF₈), which is not known to exist. This is a major contradiction.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** If Y=Kr, A1 would be KrF₄. KrF₄ is a white solid, not red. This is a major contradiction.\n\nBased on these clues, **Platinum (Pt) is by far the most likely candidate for element Y.**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Platinum Fluorides (A1-A5).**\nLet's build the full story with Y = Pt.\n*   **Y = Platinum (Pt)**\n*   **A1 = PtF₆**: Matches the description of a red, unstable solid that oxidizes xenon.\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. A plausible product is PtF₅. Let's check the mass percentage: ɷF(PtF₅) = (5 * 19) / (195.08 + 95) = 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96% (a 2.5% relative error, which is common in such problems).\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Pt and reacts with Xe. This could be PtF₄ or PtF₆.\n*   **A4 and A5**: \"By adding Y (Pt) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction: Pt + A4 → A5. This is a comproportionation reaction. A plausible reaction with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is:\n    Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF\n    This reaction fits the stoichiometry perfectly.\n*   This identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n*   **Final Clue**: \"In water, A5 decomposes\". A5=PtF, a sub-fluoride, would certainly be unstable in water.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\nBased on the deduction, A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n*   Molar Mass of Pt ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of F ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 233.08 g/mol. We compare this to the given ranges:\nA) 110-130\nB) 140-160\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction, using each piece of information to narrow down the possibilities. The most critical clues are the mass percentage of fluorine in A2, the existence of five binary fluorides, the properties of A1, and the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 (formula YFₙ) is 31.96%. The molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) can be related to the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula:\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) × (1 - ɷF)) / ɷF\nM(Y) ≈ (n × 19.00 × 0.6804) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can test integer values of n to find plausible elements:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). ɷF for PuF₆ is 31.84%.\n\nWhile Sb provides an excellent numerical fit, it fails on other chemical clues (it only has two common fluorides, not five, and its properties do not match A1). The Krypton and Plutonium/Platinum group hypotheses are more promising.\n\n**Step 2: Use the \"Five Binary Compounds\" and A1's Properties**\n\n*   The problem states that **five binary compounds** of fluorine with Y are known. This is a very strong clue. Platinum (Pt) is known to form five: PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, and PtF₆. Krypton is only known to form one stable fluoride (KrF₂) and one very unstable one (KrF₄), failing this condition.\n*   A1 is a **bright-red substance** that **decomposes at 293 K** and **oxidizes xenon**. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and is famous for being the first chemical to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for A1.\n\n**Step 3: Identify All Five Compounds (A1-A5)**\n\nAssuming Y is Platinum (Pt), we can deduce the identities of all five compounds:\n*   **A1 = PtF₆**: Matches the color, instability, and extreme oxidizing power.\n*   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The reaction is PtF₆ → A2 + F₂. The logical product is PtF₅. Let's check the mass percentage for PtF₅: ɷF = (5 × 19.00) / (195.08 + 5 × 19.00) = 95 / 290.08 ≈ 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the small discrepancy is acceptable given how well all other clues fit.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Pt and reacts with xenon. This could be PtF₄ or PtF₆. As A1 is PtF₆, A3 is likely **PtF₄**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: We are left with PtF₂ and PtF. The reaction is Y + A4 → A5 in a **1:1 molar ratio**. The only reaction that fits this stoichiometry is:\n    Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF\n    This reaction is not standard but fits the 1:1 ratio constraint perfectly if we consider the product is two moles of A5. This identifies **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**.\n*   **Final Clue**: A5 (PtF) decomposes in water. As a sub-halide, this is chemically expected.\n\nThis Platinum-based hypothesis is the only one that satisfies all the major constraints of the problem: the existence of five distinct compounds, the specific properties of A1, and the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the deduction, substance A4 is Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n*   Molar Mass of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = M(Pt) + 2 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 195.08 + 2 × 19.00 = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 220-240\nD) 160-180\n\nThe correct range is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ωF - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol). The calculated ωF for KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, M=121.8 g/mol). The calculated ωF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, which is extremely close to 31.96%.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Plutonium (Pu, M=244 g/mol). The calculated ωF for PuF₆ is 31.84%.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n\nThe most decisive clue is the reaction used to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: The only plausible comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This would identify Y=Sb, A4=SbF₅, and A5=SbF₃. However, the molar ratio of reactants is 2:3, which contradicts the 1:1 ratio given in the problem. Furthermore, Sb only has two common fluorides, not five, and SbF₅ is a stable colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. This hypothesis has too many contradictions.\n\n*   **Plutonium (Pu) Hypothesis**: While the mass percentage fits well, the known reactions for plutonium fluorides do not fit a 1:1 molar ratio for comproportionation. For example, `Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃`. This hypothesis is unlikely.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: Let's test the chemical properties if Y=Kr.\n    *   **A2 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This identifies **A1 = KrF₄**. The reaction is `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable at room temperature (293 K) and is a powerful oxidizing agent that would react with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color is likely an error in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is a colorless solid.\n    *   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y (Kr) and interacts with xenon. This is consistent with **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **Reaction for A4 and A5**: The reaction is `Y + A4 → A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio. The known reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` fits this 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n    *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   The final clue states A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water, which is correct as it hydrolyzes readily.\n\nThis Krypton-based solution provides the most chemically consistent narrative, especially regarding the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry, despite minor inconsistencies in the descriptive text (color, number of compounds).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nBased on the most consistent deduction, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n*   MW(A4) ≈ 83.80 + 76.00 = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct range.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol.

The molar mass of Y (M(Y)) can be related to the molar mass of Fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula:\n    M(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\n    M(Y) ≈ (n × 19.0 / 0.3196) - (n × 19.0)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\n    We must test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible element:\n    *   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 2 = 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Krypton (Kr)**, which is 83.8 g/mol. The calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is (2×19)/121.8 = 31.2%, which is a reasonable match.\n    *   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 3 = 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. The calculated ɷF for SbF₃ is (3×19)/178.76 = 31.88%, a near-perfect match.\n    *   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × 6 = 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Plutonium (Pu)**, which is ~244 g/mol. The calculated ɷF for PuF₆ is (6×19)/358 = 31.84%, also a near-perfect match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n    The most decisive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes a reaction with a specific 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) Path**: While the mass percentage fit is excellent, this path fails on multiple chemical properties. Antimony only has two common fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. A1 would be SbF₅, which is a stable colorless liquid, not an unstable bright-red solid. Most importantly, the reaction between Sb and its fluorides does not have a 1:1 stoichiometry (the known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃). This path has too many contradictions.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu) Path**: This path also has an excellent mass percentage fit. However, if A2 is PuF₆, then A1 must be a higher fluoride (e.g., PuF₈), which is not a well-established compound. This makes the initial decomposition step problematic.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) Path**: This path provides the most coherent explanation, especially for the 1:1 reaction.\n        *   **A1** decomposes into **A2** and fluorine: This fits the reaction **KrF₄ (A1) → KrF₂ (A2) + F₂**. KrF₄ is known to be unstable at room temperature (293 K).\n        *   **A1** and **A3** oxidize xenon: Both KrF₄ and KrF₂ are exceptionally strong oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon.\n        *   **1:1 Reaction**: The reaction **Kr (Y) + KrF₄ (A4) → 2KrF₂ (A5)** fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly. This is a known, albeit not common, comproportionation reaction. This provides a clear identity for A4 and A5.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight.**\n    Based on the Krypton path, which best explains the specific 1:1 stoichiometry, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 ≈ 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\nWhile the problem contains inconsistencies (Krypton does not have five well-known binary fluorides, and KrF₄ is a white solid, not red), the Krypton hypothesis provides the most logical and consistent explanation for the most specific chemical clues, particularly the decomposition reaction and the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the provided candidate solutions and the problem's constraints.\n\n**1. Analyze the Core Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Mass Percentage of A2.** A2 is a binary fluoride (YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The molar mass of Y can be estimated with the formula M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n*   **Clue 2: Number of Compounds.** Five binary fluorides of Y are known.\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1.** A1 is bright-red, decomposes at room temperature (293 K) into A2 and F₂, and oxidizes xenon. This implies A1 is a highly unstable, powerful oxidizing agent with a higher fluorine content than A2.\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Reaction.** The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. This is a strong hint for a specific type of comproportionation reaction.\n*   **Clue 5: Properties of A4.** A4 is used in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n\n**2. Evaluate the Main Hypotheses from the Candidate Answers**\n\nThere are three primary candidates for element Y: Antimony (Sb), Krypton (Kr), and Platinum (Pt).\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis (Answers 3, 4, 5):**\n    *   **Pro:** The mass percentage calculation for A2=SbF₃ (31.88%) is an almost perfect match for the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Cons:** This hypothesis fails on nearly every other point.\n        *   Antimony only has two common binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five.\n        *   A1 would be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at 293 K.\n        *   There is no known 1:1 reaction for `Sb + A4 -> A5`. The actual reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ -> 5SbF₃`, which has a 2:3 ratio.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The excellent mass percentage match is likely a deliberate misdirection. The chemical inconsistencies are too severe.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis (Answers 1, 6, 7):**\n    *   **Pros:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂` fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly (identifying A4=KrF₄, A5=KrF₂). The properties of A1 (unstable, oxidizes Xe) are a good fit for KrF₄.\n    *   **Cons:**\n        *   The mass percentage for A2=KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is a noticeable deviation from 31.96%.\n        *   Krypton does not have five well-established binary fluorides.\n        *   The physical properties are wrong: KrF₄ is a white solid, not a \"bright-red\" substance (A1) or something that forms a \"solution\" (A4).\n        *   This hypothesis identifies A1 and A4 as the same compound, and A2, A3, and A5 as the same compound, which seems unlikely.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While the 1:1 reaction is elegant, this path has multiple significant flaws. If A4=KrF₄, its MW is ~160 g/mol (Range C).\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis (Answer 2):**\n    *   **Pros:**\n        *   Platinum is known to form five binary fluorides (PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆), perfectly matching Clue 2.\n        *   A1=PtF₆ is a dark-red solid, one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known (it was famously used to oxidize xenon), and is thermally unstable. This is an excellent match for Clue 3.\n        *   The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ -> 2PtF` is a known comproportionation that fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly (identifying A4=PtF₂, A5=PtF). This matches Clue 4.\n    *   **Cons:**\n        *   The mass percentage for A2=PtF₅ (the likely decomposition product of PtF₆) is 32.75%, which is a reasonable but not perfect match for 31.96%.\n        *   A4=PtF₂ is a yellowish-green insoluble solid, which contradicts the \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This hypothesis provides the most chemically consistent story. It correctly accounts for the number of compounds, the specific properties of the powerful oxidant A1, and the crucial 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The only significant flaw is the physical description of the A4 solution, which is a very common type of red herring or simplification in complex chemistry problems.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nThe Platinum hypothesis is the most robust. It aligns with the majority of the chemical principles and specific numerical constraints given in the problem. The inconsistencies in the other hypotheses are more fundamental (e.g., incorrect stoichiometry, non-existence of compounds).\n\nLet's finalize the identification based on the Platinum hypothesis:\n*   Y = Platinum (Pt)\n*   A1 = PtF₆\n*   A2 = PtF₅ (decomposition product)\n*   A3 = PtF₄ (another fluoride)\n*   **A4 = PtF₂** (reactant in the 1:1 reaction)\n*   A5 = PtF (product of the 1:1 reaction)\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance **A4**.\n*   A4 = PtF₂\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of PtF₂ = M(Pt) + 2 * M(F)\n*   MW(PtF₂) ≈ 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**\n\nThis value falls squarely within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem is a chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction, evaluating multiple hypotheses against a set of clues. Several clues appear to be contradictory, which is common in such problems, forcing a decision on which pieces of evidence are most reliable.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most quantitative clue is that substance A2, a binary fluoride of element Y (YFₙ), has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nWhere M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nRearranging to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = (n × 19.00 × (1 - 0.3196)) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n    *   Let's check the ɷF for KrF₂: (2×19) / (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n    *   Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3×19) / (121.8 + 57) = 31.9%. This is an excellent match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n    *   Let's check the ɷF for PuF₆: (6×19) / (244 + 114) = 31.8%. This is also an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Hypotheses (Kr, Sb, Pu) against Other Clues**\n\nWe must now test these three possibilities against the other clues, especially the reaction stoichiometry and chemical properties.\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**:\n    *   Fails on the \"five binary compounds\" clue (only SbF₃ and SbF₅ are common).\n    *   Fails on the properties of A1. A1 would be SbF₅, which is a stable, colorless liquid, not a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\".\n    *   Fails on the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry. The reaction Sb + SbF₅ -> SbF₃ has a 2:3 ratio.\n    *   This hypothesis is chemically inconsistent despite the excellent mass percentage match.\n\n*   **Plutonium (Pu) Hypothesis**:\n    *   Fits the \"five binary compounds\" clue well.\n    *   The reaction `Pu + A4 -> A5` would be a comproportionation (e.g., `Pu + 3PuF₄ -> 4PuF₃`), but the 1:1 stoichiometry is not met.\n    *   If A4 were PuF₄, its molecular weight would be ~320 g/mol, which is not in any of the answer ranges.\n    *   This hypothesis leads to a dead end.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**:\n    *   **A1/A2/A3**: A1 decomposes to A2 and F₂. This fits A1=KrF₄ and A2=KrF₂. Both KrF₄ and KrF₂ (A3) are extremely powerful oxidizing agents that would react with Xenon. The instability of A1 (KrF₄) at room temperature (293 K) is also correct. The \"bright-red\" color is a known inaccuracy in this classic problem statement; KrF₄ is a colorless solid.\n    *   **A4/A5 Reaction**: The clue states `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ -> 2KrF₂` is a known type of comproportionation that fits the 1:1 stoichiometry perfectly.\n    *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **Properties of A4**: A4 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, so a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" (e.g., in a suitable non-aqueous solvent like HF) is plausible.\n    *   **Properties of A5**: A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water, which is correct.\n    *   This hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation, especially for the crucial 1:1 stoichiometry, by assuming the descriptive clues (color, number of compounds) are less reliable than the reaction data.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Range**\n\nBased on the most consistent hypothesis, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight falls squarely within the range **140-160**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Potential Candidates for Element Y**\n\nThe most crucial piece of quantitative information is that substance A2, a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ), has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n\nWe can use the formula for mass percentage to estimate the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n0.3196 = (n × 19.0) / (M(Y) + n × 19.0)\n\nRearranging the formula gives: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nLet's test plausible integer values for n:\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\nWe have three main candidates for Y: Krypton, Antimony, and Plutonium.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Against the Reaction Clues**\n\nThe problem describes several chemical reactions. The most specific and restrictive clue is the reaction to form A5:\n\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis describes the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)**.\n\nLet's test our candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The reaction would be a comproportionation between Sb(0) and a higher fluoride like SbF₅. The balanced chemical equation is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. The molar ratio of Y (Sb) to A4 (SbF₅) is 2:3, which is not 1:1. Therefore, Antimony is incorrect.\n*   **Plutonium (Pu):** A plausible comproportionation reaction is Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃. The molar ratio is 1:3, not 1:1. Therefore, Plutonium is incorrect.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Let's consider the comproportionation reaction between Krypton and its higher fluoride, Krypton tetrafluoride: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**. In this reaction, 1 mole of Y (Kr) reacts with 1 mole of A4 (KrF₄). **This is a perfect 1:1 molar ratio.**\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis is the only one that satisfies this critical stoichiometric requirement.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the Identities of the Compounds**\n\nBased on the Krypton hypothesis, we can identify the substances:\n*   **Y = Kr** (Krypton)\n*   **A4 = KrF₄** (Krypton tetrafluoride), from the 1:1 reaction.\n*   **A5 = KrF₂** (Krypton difluoride), the product of the reaction.\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 and fluorine. The reaction KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂ fits this. So, **A1 = KrF₄** and **A2 = KrF₂**.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorinating Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂) and reacts with xenon. This identifies **A3 = KrF₂**.\n\nThis set of identifications is chemically consistent, even if some descriptive details in the problem (like the \"bright-red\" color of A1) are inaccurate, which is common in such puzzles.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nWe have identified A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Atomic Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Atomic Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 = 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.8 g/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Select the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls into the range given in option C.\n*   A) 220-240\n*   B) 110-130\n*   C) 140-160\n*   D) 160-180\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Quantitative Clue (Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2)**\n\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can calculate the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) as a function of n (the number of fluorine atoms).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nRearranging for M(Y): M(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\nUsing M(F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196:\nM(Y) ≈ n × 19.0 × (1/0.3196 - 1) ≈ n × 40.45 g/mol\n\nLet's test integer values of n:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8). ɷF(KrF₂) = 31.2%. (Fair match)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Close to Antimony (Sb, 121.8). ɷF(SbF₃) = 31.88%. (Excellent match)\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Close to Plutonium (Pu, 244). ɷF(PuF₆) = 31.84%. (Excellent match)\n\nThe excellent numerical match for Antimony (Sb) is tempting, but it leads to major chemical contradictions (only two fluorides, not five; properties of SbF₅ do not match A1; reaction stoichiometry fails). The Plutonium path also fails to produce a molecular weight for A4 that fits any of the options. This suggests the precise mass percentage might be a red herring, or there's a typo in the problem, and we should rely more on the qualitative chemical clues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Qualitative Clues**\n\n1.  **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"** This strongly suggests a transition metal or a heavy element. Platinum (Pt) and Plutonium (Pu) are excellent candidates. Krypton (Kr) and Antimony (Sb) are poor candidates.\n2.  **\"The bright-red substance A1 ... oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"** This is a very specific and powerful clue. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a famous dark-red solid and is one of the few substances capable of oxidizing xenon, which led to the discovery of noble gas compounds. This makes **Y = Platinum (Pt)** and **A1 = PtF₆** a very strong hypothesis.\n3.  **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine.\"** PtF₆ is known to be thermally unstable and can decompose to lower fluorides. The reaction PtF₆ → PtF₅ + F is known. This would make **A2 = PtF₅**. Let's check the mass percentage for PtF₅: ɷF = (5×19)/(195.08 + 5×19) = 95/290.08 ≈ 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, and the discrepancy is acceptable given the strength of the other clues.\n4.  **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a ... solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This describes the reaction: Pt + A4 → A5. The 1:1 stoichiometry is key. The known fluorides of platinum are PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, and PtF. We have already assigned A1=PtF₆ and A2=PtF₅. A plausible comproportionation reaction involving the remaining fluorides that fits a 1:1 ratio is:\n    **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**\n    This reaction perfectly fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants (Y and A4).\n5.  **Identify A4 and A5.** From the reaction above, we can identify **A4 = PtF₂** and **A5 = PtF**. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is consistent with the nature of a sub-halide like PtF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Select the Range**\n\nBased on the consistent line of reasoning above, substance A4 is platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Platinum (Pt) ≈ 195.08 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (PtF₂) = M(Pt) + 2 × M(F)\n*   MW(A4) = 195.08 + 2 × 19.00 = 195.08 + 38.00 = **233.08 g/mol**\n\nNow, we check which range this value falls into:\nA) 220-240\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided chemical clues, the most consistent identification for element Y is Platinum (Pt). This conclusion allows for the logical identification of the unknown substances and the determination of the molecular weight of A4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y**: The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. This points to an element with a rich fluoride chemistry. Furthermore, substance A1 is described as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\". This is a very strong clue. Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon, as demonstrated by Neil Bartlett in 1962. This makes Platinum (Pt) a very strong candidate for element Y.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance A1 and A2**:\n    *   **A1**: Based on the properties above, A1 is **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)**. It is a dark-red, volatile solid and one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known.\n    *   **A2**: A1 (PtF₆) decomposes into A2 and fluorine. This implies A2 is a lower fluoride of platinum. A plausible decomposition product is Platinum pentafluoride (PtF₅). Let's check the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in PtF₅. The molar mass of PtF₅ is approximately 290.08 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (5 * 19.00) / 290.08 ≈ 32.75%. This value is reasonably close to the 31.96% given in the problem, with the small discrepancy likely being an acceptable error in the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A3**: A3 is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Pt) and also interacts with xenon. Direct fluorination of platinum can produce several fluorides, including PtF₄ and PtF₆. Both are strong oxidizing agents. This is consistent with our identification.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5**: The key reaction is the addition of Y (Pt) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio to yield A5 (`Y + A4 → A5`). This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in oxidation state 0 reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state.\n    *   The known binary fluorides of platinum are PtF₆, PtF₅, PtF₄, PtF₂, and PtF.\n    *   We have assigned A1=PtF₆ and A2=PtF₅. The remaining candidates for A4 and A5 are PtF₄, PtF₂, and PtF.\n    *   A reaction that fits the 1:1 molar ratio is: **Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF**.\n    *   This reaction identifies **A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂) and A5 as Platinum(I) fluoride (PtF)**.\n    *   The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is chemically sound for a sub-halide like PtF.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4**:\n    *   From the deduction above, substance A4 is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n    *   The molecular weight is the sum of the atomic weights of its constituent atoms: M(Pt) + 2 * M(F).\n    *   Using the atomic weight of Platinum (≈195.08 g/mol) and Fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol), the molecular weight of PtF₂ is 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range**: The calculated molecular weight of 233.08 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful step-by-step deduction, weighing chemical plausibility against numerical data. Several clues seem contradictory, which is common in complex chemical puzzles, forcing a decision on which clues are most reliable.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine (ɷF) in A2.**\n    The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine in a compound YFₙ is:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    Given ɷF = 31.96% (0.3196) and M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, we can solve for the molar mass of Y (M(Y)):\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n    We test integer values for n:\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for KrF₂: (2×19) / (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is a reasonable fit.\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for SbF₃: (3×19) / (121.76 + 57) = 31.88%. This is an excellent numerical fit.\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). Let's check the ɷF for PuF₆: (6×19) / (244 + 114) = 31.84%. This is also an excellent fit.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates (Kr, Sb, Pu) against the other clues.**\n    The most decisive clue is the reaction: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) hypothesis:** The main fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The most plausible reaction involving Sb metal is the comproportionation: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This reaction does not have a 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis fails on the stoichiometry.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu) hypothesis:** Plutonium has a rich fluoride chemistry. A plausible comproportionation is 3PuF₄ + Pu → 4PuF₃. This reaction does not have a 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis also fails on the stoichiometry.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) hypothesis:** Let's examine the reactions of Krypton fluorides. A known reaction is the formation of Krypton difluoride from Krypton and Krypton tetrafluoride: **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂**. This reaction has a **perfect 1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants (Y and A4). This is a very strong indication that Y is Krypton.\n\n3.  **Identify all compounds based on the Krypton hypothesis.**\n    *   **Y = Krypton (Kr)**\n    *   The reaction is Kr (Y) + KrF₄ (A4) → 2KrF₂ (A5).\n    *   This identifies **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   Let's check the other clues. A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. If A1 is KrF₄, it would decompose into a lower fluoride and F₂. However, our reaction identifies A4 as KrF₄. Let's re-read: \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (...) and fluorine\". This means A1 → A2 + F₂. The reaction Kr + A4 → A5 is separate.\n    *   Let's assume the most unstable fluoride is A1. So, **A1 = KrF₄**. It decomposes via KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂. This makes **A2 = KrF₂**.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂) and reacts with Xenon. This makes **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   This leaves the reaction Y + A4 → A5. We have identified all plausible compounds (KrF₂, KrF₄). If A4 is KrF₂, the reaction Kr + KrF₂ is unlikely. If A4 is KrF₄, the reaction Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂ fits the 1:1 ratio perfectly. This means **A4 = KrF₄** and **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   This assignment is consistent: A2, A3, and A5 are all KrF₂, while A1 and A4 are KrF₄. The problem states five compounds are *known*, not that A1-A5 are all different. The inconsistencies (the \"bright-red\" color for KrF₄, the \"five compounds\" rule for Kr) are likely deliberate flaws in the problem statement, which is common. The 1:1 stoichiometry is the most specific and restrictive chemical clue.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n    Based on the deduction, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   Molar mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the correct range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory. A step-by-step analysis, prioritizing the quantitative information, leads to the most logical solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFₙ) and has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for mass percentage is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\nwhere M(F) is the molar mass of Fluorine (≈ 19.00 g/mol), M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y, and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) = n × M(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\nM(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca)\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr)\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (e.g., Dy)\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu)\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for SbF₃:\nM(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\nɷF = (3 × 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis is a near-perfect match to the given 31.96%, making Antimony the most likely candidate for element Y, and **A2 = SbF₃**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the other clues based on Y = Sb.**\n*   **\"Five binary compounds...\"**: Antimony is primarily known for two fluorides, SbF₃ and SbF₅. This clue appears to be incorrect or misleading, a common feature in such puzzle-like problems.\n*   **A1**: Decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, so **A1 = SbF₅**. The description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" does not match the properties of SbF₅ (a stable, colorless liquid). This is another likely inaccuracy in the problem statement.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb) and oxidizes xenon. This also points to the most powerful fluorinating agent of antimony, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The key reaction is \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   The available fluorides for A4 are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₅, the reaction is a comproportionation: 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This reaction is well-known, but the molar ratio is 2:3, not 1:1.\n    *   If A4 = SbF₃, the reaction is Sb + SbF₃ → A5. While chemically unusual, the stoichiometry is exactly 1:1 as stated in the problem. Given the other inconsistencies, it is most probable that we are meant to strictly follow the 1:1 ratio clue.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and calculate its molecular weight.**\nBased on the 1:1 molar ratio clue, we must identify **A4 as SbF₃**.\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is:\nMW(SbF₃) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) ≈ 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct range.**\nThe calculated molecular weight of 178.76 g/mol falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 220-240\nD) 140-160\n\nThe correct range is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
