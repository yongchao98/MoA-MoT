NaNO2 + HCl\n2. H2O\n3. aq. KOH, Heat \n\n1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Identify the final product.\n\nA) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal\nB) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal\nC) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\nD) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) indicate a strong electron-donating group is attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 group is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling them gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the molecular formula.\n    The starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (hydrolysis), typically upon gentle warming. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This is a self-aldol condensation reaction. 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde).\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH- from KOH) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   The structure of the addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with heating. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   The structure of the condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe question asks for the *final* product. The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly indicates that the reaction proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated condensation product, rather than stopping at the aldol addition stage.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final aldol condensation product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is identified by first determining the structure of the starting material and then analyzing the subsequent reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting compound is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 units) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group).\n\nThe 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the aldehyde region. The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This corresponds to a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts suggest the presence of an electron-donating group.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the -CH2- group that is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with both the molecular formula and all the NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate formed is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle heating, results in the hydrolysis of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This addition reaction forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a proton from the α-carbon are removed, creating a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration step is generally favorable as it leads to a conjugated system. The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is the final, stable product of the aldol condensation reaction under heating.\n\nComparing this structure to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - Matches the predicted final product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material (C8H9NO):**\n    *   First, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get a clue about the structure. DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n    *   Next, I'll analyze the 1H-NMR signals:\n        *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This is a classic aldehyde (-CHO) proton signal. The triplet (t) means it's adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n        *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n        *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: A methylene (-CH2-) group. The doublet (d) indicates it's adjacent to a single proton, which confirms it's next to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   Putting it all together: We have a para-substituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group. This gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** These are the reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   **Step 2: H2O, Heat:** Adding water and heat to a diazonium salt results in its hydrolysis, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This provides a strong base (OH-) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). These are the perfect conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   In an aldol condensation, the base (KOH) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms an aldol addition product: `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal` (which is option B).\n    *   However, the reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat promotes a dehydration reaction (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The final product, `2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal`, directly matches option A.\n\n```python\n# This script will determine the final product of the described chemical reaction.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the starting material from the provided molecular formula and NMR data.\n# The molecular formula is C8H9NO.\n# The NMR data (9.72 ppm aldehyde, para-substituted ring, NH2 group, CH2 group)\n# points to the structure being 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\nstarting_material = \"4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\"\n\n# Step 2: Trace the reaction sequence.\n# Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n# Reaction 2: H2O + Heat hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing it with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n# The intermediate product after these two steps is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\nintermediate = \"4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\"\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the final reaction.\n# Reagent 3 is aq.

The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, as the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (below 7 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2H is characteristic of an amino group (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CH₂-CHO, -NH₂, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring), we can assemble the structure. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the amino group and the acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This is the standard reagent for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n    The product after this step is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt, usually with gentle warming, causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This is a hydrolysis reaction where N₂ gas is evolved.\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms an aldol addition product.\n        *   Enolate: `[HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻`\n        *   Electrophile: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n        *   Addition Product (after protonation): `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal` (This corresponds to option B).\n\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The presence of **heat** strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n        *   Adduct: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C4)-CH(OH)(C3)-CH(C₂)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(C1)`\n        *   Elimination of H₂O gives a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        *   Final Product: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C4)-CH(C3)=C(C₂)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(C1)`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe final product of the aldol condensation (under heat) is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Let's name this structure:\n*   The parent chain is a butenal (4-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n*   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n*   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C2.\n*   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C4.\n*   The systematic name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The hydroxyl groups are missing.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. It is not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final aldol condensation product, formed after dehydration. This matches our derived structure.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure and stoichiometry.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring. The presence of an aldehyde group (C=O) would account for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to an adjacent group with 1 proton (n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the -CH2- protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4- or para-disubstituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5 °C:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **H2O, Heat:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water, which hydrolyzes it. The -N₂⁺ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   This two-step process effectively converts the starting 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal into **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n    *   **aq. KOH:** Potassium hydroxide is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon to form an enolate ion.\n    *   This enolate ion is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This is a self-**aldol addition** reaction.\n    *   The product of the addition is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    *   **Heat:** The reaction is heated. Aldol addition products readily undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) under heat, especially when the resulting product is conjugated. This step is called **aldol condensation**.\n    *   The β-hydroxy aldehyde eliminates water (the -OH from C3 and an acidic H from C2) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The formation of the C=C double bond creates a conjugated system (phenyl-C=C-C=O), which is thermodynamically very stable and drives the reaction to completion.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe reaction sequence leads to an aldol condensation product.\n*   Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n*   Aldol Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D)\n*   Final Condensation Product (due to heat): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option A)\n\nSince the conditions specify \"Heat\", the final isolated product will be the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees, leaving one degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons suggests a primary amine (-NH₂) group attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a methylene (-CH₂-) group. Its coupling to the aldehyde proton (a single proton) explains the doublet multiplicity.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for diazotization. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The aldehyde group remains unaffected. The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has both an aldehyde group and α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), which are the classic requirements for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    *   However, the presence of **heat** strongly favors the subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) of this aldol addition product. This elimination results in the formation of a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, leads to the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. The resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **But-2-enal:** A four-carbon chain with an aldehyde at position 1 and a double bond starting at position 2.\n*   **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl):** A 4-hydroxyphenyl group is attached to carbon 2, and another is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThis structure matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region, combined with the reaction conditions (diazotization), points to a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a -CH2- group adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This fits perfectly with the -CH2-CHO fragment, where this -CH2- is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   The first reagent, NaNO2 and HCl, is used for diazotization, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    *   The subsequent addition of water (H₂O) and warming hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages: an initial aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen (from the -CH2- group) of one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (structure corresponding to option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a hydrogen on the α-carbon are removed, forming a double bond. This results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group.\n    *   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3.

This is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (16 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=C or C=O).\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region suggests a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH2-) that is coupled to a single proton, which would be the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:** Based on the fragments identified (a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** Adding water to the diazonium salt and typically warming the mixture results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Nitrogen gas is evolved during this process.\n    *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which are the requirements for an aldol condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is a known entity, and its synthesis and properties have been described in the literature.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, the final product is the dehydrated, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, not the intermediate aldol addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) - 0/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with the -CH2- group being adjacent to the -CHO group, confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.

This is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2) attached to the aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CH2-CHO, 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, -NH2), we can assemble the structure. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the amino group (-NH2) and the acetaldehyde group (-CH2-CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amino group) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO.

This is a hydrolysis reaction (Sandmeyer-type reaction) where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Under these conditions, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by the extended conjugation between the benzene ring, the new C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond.\n\n    *   **Final Product Structure:**\n        The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of a double bond between the α-carbon (C2) and β-carbon (C3).\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate.

Since there is only one type of aldehyde, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product of the aldol condensation.**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n1.  **Aldol Addition:**\n    *   The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n    *   Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the aldol addition product.\n    *   The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n\n     \n\n2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):**\n    *   The reaction conditions include **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product.\n    *   The base (OH-) removes the acidic proton from the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (C2). The resulting carbanion eliminates the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3).\n    *   This forms a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n     \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal into 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. The presence of heat ensures that the reaction proceeds to the final dehydrated product, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. This matches option B.\n\n*   Option A is incorrect as it would result from a different set of reactants.\n*   Option C is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   Option D is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups formed during the reaction sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 5. This indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a carbonyl group).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. The doublet (d) splitting confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to two protons is indicative of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling the fragments (a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group) gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The molecular formula C8H9NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-), forming 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride. This reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** Adding water and warming the solution hydrolyzes the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction. The reactant, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has both an aldehyde group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde), making it suitable for a self-condensation reaction.\n\n**3. The Aldol Condensation Product**\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. In this case, the addition product would be 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option B).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes a subsequent dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The acidic α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nBased on this three-step reaction sequence, the final product is the result of the aldol condensation, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant from its molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C8H9NO):** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and splitting pattern (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2-) next to the aldehyde group. The doublet splitting confirms they are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The para-substituted ring contains an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to the corresponding diazonium salt.\n\n2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** Adding water to the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-condensation reaction.\n    *   First, an aldol addition occurs, where the enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   With the application of heat, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure\n\nThe self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Addition Product (Intermediate):** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option D).\n*   **Condensation Product (Final):** Upon heating, this intermediate eliminates water to form a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure is a but-2-enal with 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect hydroxyl groups and double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect, as it's a product of a single molecule, not a condensation of two.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - **Correct.** This matches our derived final product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO. The provided 1H-NMR data is analyzed to determine the structure of the starting compound:\n*   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group).\n*   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (the -CHO proton). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n*   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts indicate the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n*   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n\nAssembling these fragments (a para-substituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group) gives the structure 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The formula C8H9NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is transformed into 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt results in the substitution of the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This step produces 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). Treating this aldehyde with a base (KOH) and heat initiates an aldol condensation.\n    *   First, the base removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, option C).\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction under heat to yield the final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound from the given data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., C=O, C=C).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons, meaning it's next to a -CH₂- group. This confirms a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH₂- group protons. The doublet (d) splitting indicates that these two protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the **-CH₂-CHO** fragment. The chemical shift is appropriate for a methylene group attached to both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, is a hallmark of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H, which disappears on D₂O exchange (a common characteristic though not explicitly stated), is indicative of an amine group **(-NH₂) **. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde fragment (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (H₂N-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) reacts to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride ([⁺N≡N]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO Cl⁻)\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water (often with gentle warming) to the diazonium salt results in hydrolysis, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).

This forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is the structure in option A).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is **heated**, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The proton on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product, not just the initial addition product, due to the heating condition.\n\n*   Option A, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate.\n*   Option B, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, is the final condensation product.\n*   Options C and D are structurally incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** 5 (suggesting a benzene ring and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl group).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde's single proton, hence it appears as a doublet. This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nAssembling these fragments, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  **H₂O:** Water is added to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction, sometimes called the Sandmeyer reaction (though technically just hydrolysis), forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group) of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This initially forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The final product of this condensation is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This specific compound has been synthesized and studied for its biological activities.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all reaction steps, including heating. The heat drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable, dehydrated condensation product over the simple addition product.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the hydroxyl groups are missing and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   **Option B** is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would be isolated under milder conditions without heat.\n*   **Option C** is the final aldol condensation product, resulting from dehydration of the adduct, which is expected under heating.\n*   **Option D** is an incorrect structure that would not be formed from this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed via aldol condensation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Starting Material:** The first step is to determine the structure of the starting compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided 1H-NMR data.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU). DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one other double bond or ring (DoU=1).\n    *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This is a very characteristic signal for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1 rule, 2 protons + 1 = 3 peaks). So, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the CH2 group. It's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1 proton + 1 = 2 peaks), confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Putting it all together:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the -NH2 group, and the other is the -CH2-CHO group. This gives us 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. It matches perfectly. The double bond in the C=O of the aldehyde accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:** Now, let's see what happens when 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is subjected to the given reagents.\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O):** This is the classic two-step procedure for converting a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n        *   Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl): The primary amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n        *   Step 2 (H2O, usually with heat): The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group.\n        *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This is a strong base with heat. The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the hydrogens on the CH2 group). These are the perfect conditions for a self-**aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option C).\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly suggests that the aldol addition product will not be the final product. The initial adduct will readily dehydrate (lose a molecule of water) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group leaves, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n        *   The final dehydrated product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n3.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (should be hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, stable aldol condensation product formed after dehydration. This matches our derived structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product is D.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_reaction_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step thought process to identify the final product of the chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the starting compound from molecular formula and NMR data.\n    start_compound_name = \"4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\"\n    reasoning_step1 = [\n        \"1.

The C=O of an aldehyde would account for this.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH₂-CHO group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment, where the CH₂ protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts, particularly the upfield signal at 6.51 ppm, suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong EDG, which explains the observed aromatic shifts.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is an amino group (-NH₂), and the other must be the acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) to account for all remaining atoms (C₂H₃O).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence.**\n    *   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** These are the reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        *   *Intermediate 1:* 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n    *   **Step 2: H₂O:** The diazonium salt is treated with water. When warmed, diazonium salts hydrolyze, and the -N₂⁺ group (an excellent leaving group) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a type of Sandmeyer-like reaction.\n        *   *Intermediate 2:* **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the product from step 2 (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** A base (OH⁻ from KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            *   The addition product is: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. (This corresponds to option A).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-hydrogen (at C-2) and the β-hydroxyl group (at C-3) are removed to form a double bond. This process is called dehydration or condensation. The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            *   The condensation product is: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. (This corresponds to option B).\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product.**\n    *   The term \"aldol condensation\" technically refers to the two-step process of addition followed by dehydration. The presence of heat strongly favors the dehydration step because the resulting conjugated system (the C=C double bond is conjugated with both the C=O of the aldehyde and one of the phenyl rings) is thermodynamically very stable.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition product (A), but will proceed to the more stable condensation product (B).\n    *   Option C is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups.\n    *   Option D is incorrect as it is not a dimerization product and has the wrong number of carbon atoms.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration promoted by heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, X is the number of halogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n    *   DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring. The C=O of an aldehyde or ketone would account for the fifth DBE.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons (a -CH2- group) according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons. Its broadness suggests it's due to exchangeable protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, this signal is very likely from a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH- group). This fits perfectly with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment we proposed earlier: the two protons of the CH2 group are coupled to the single proton of the CHO group, resulting in a doublet.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    *   We have the following pieces: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde side chain (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the pieces add up to the molecular formula: C6H4 + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n    *   The two substituents on the para-disubstituted ring must be the -NH2 group and the -CH2CHO group.\n    *   The structure is therefore **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (or p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, Heat**\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5°C): Diazotization.** This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n        *   Intermediate: 4-(diazoniomethyl)phenylacetaldehyde chloride `([Cl⁻][N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)`\n    2.  **H2O, Heat: Hydrolysis.** Heating the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to hydrolyze. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n        *   Product after steps 1 & 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `(HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat applied to an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, also known as an aldol adduct.\n        *   Adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option A.\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The \"Heat\" condition indicates that the reaction will not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct will readily lose a molecule of water (dehydrate) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        *   This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\n*   The final product is the result of the full aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration).\n*   Let's analyze the structure of 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:\n    *   It is a but-2-enal, meaning a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached to C2.\n    *   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached to C4.\n    *   This structure matches the description in option D.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1.  The starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  Diazotization followed by hydrolysis converts it to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n3.  Self-aldol condensation (addition followed by heat-induced dehydration) of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde yields 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nTherefore, the final product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1.

Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    Primary aromatic amines react with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) to form diazonium salts. The amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium group (-N₂⁺).\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 4-(diazoniumchloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has both an aldehyde and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which are the required components for an aldol condensation.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (aldol addition).\n    3.  The resulting β-hydroxy aldehyde is named 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (A).\n    4.  The \"Heat\" condition promotes the dehydration (loss of a water molecule) of the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. This elimination reaction creates a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n    *   *Final Product:* The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the starting material and the reaction sequence, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\nThe step-by-step analysis of the reaction is as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   9.72 ppm (t, 1H): This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   3.66 ppm (d, 2H): This doublet corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methine (-CH-) group, in this case, the aldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The para-substituted ring contains an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2CHO group. The formula C8H9NO and the NMR splitting patterns are consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**: This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is transformed into the corresponding arenediazonium salt, (4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**: Treating the diazonium salt with water leads to its hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**: This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The molecule possesses acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group), making it susceptible to an aldol reaction.\n    *   An enolate is formed when the hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Product A).\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination is favorable as it results in a highly conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde). The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the multi-step synthesis, the final product is the result of the aldol condensation, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting (t) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a -CH₂- group. The doublet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The NMR data aligns perfectly with this structure: the amine and the acetaldehyde group are para to each other on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    *   This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The intermediate formed is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and typically warming the mixture results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This step produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation. An aldol condensation is a two-part reaction: an aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from the -CH₂- group of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms an aldol addition product, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on carbon 3 and the acidic proton on carbon 2 are removed, forming a double bond. This results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction. Given the application of heat in the final step, the reaction proceeds to completion to form the dehydrated condensation product, not just the initial addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 units of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring. The signals in the aromatic region (6-8 ppm) confirm the benzene ring. The extra unit of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), as suggested by the very downfield aldehyde proton.\n\n    *   **Analysis of 1H-NMR Data:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a CH2 group. This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1=2, so n=1). The chemical shift of ~3.6 ppm is consistent with a methylene group attached to both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (benzylic and α to carbonyl).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is indicative of an amine group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH). Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is an -NH2 group.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group.\n        The structure is therefore **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify this structure against the data:\n        - Formula: C6H4 (ring) + CH2 + CHO + NH2 = C8H9NO. (Correct)\n        - NMR: The electron-donating -NH2 group shields the ortho protons (making them appear upfield, ~6.51 ppm), while the weakly electron-withdrawing -CH2CHO group results in the other aromatic protons appearing more downfield (~6.98 ppm). The -CH2CHO fragment protons match the observed coupling (d and t). The -NH2 protons appear as a broad singlet. The structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This reagent mixture, typically used at low temperatures (0-5 °C), converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n        The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-).\n        **Intermediate A:** 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Aqueous diazonium salts are generally unstable. Upon warming, they react with water to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, liberating nitrogen gas (N2).\n        **Intermediate B:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        We now have an aldehyde (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde) in the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an aldol condensation reaction.\n        The aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- group).\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n        3.  **Aldol Addition Product:** The structure of this initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are removed. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        5.  **Final Product:** The elimination of water results in the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is a highly stable conjugated system (the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings), so its formation is strongly favored under heat. This structure corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion**\n\n    The question asks for the final product of the entire reaction sequence. The aldol reaction under heat proceeds through the addition product (structure C) to the final, more stable dehydrated condensation product (structure B). Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect stoichiometry; this product contains only one phenyl ring, whereas the self-condensation uses two molecules of the starting aldehyde.\n    *   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final product of the aldol condensation (dehydration of the aldol adduct). This is the most likely answer.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, formed before the heat-induced dehydration step. It is not the final product.\n    *   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents; the -NH2 group was converted to an -OH group, so the final product should have hydroxyphenyl rings, not phenyl rings.\n\nThus, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 DBE) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a CH2 group). This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) splitting is caused by the single aldehyde proton. This further confirms the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). An amine is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group.\n    Attaching these to a benzene ring gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from CH2) + C (from CHO) + NH2 + H (from CH2) + H (from CHO) = **C8H9NO**. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A):** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reagent mixture converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). This reaction is typically performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    The product (Intermediate B) is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming it up causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    The product (Intermediate C) is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen (from the CH2 group) of one molecule to form an enolate ion.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    3.  **Dehydration:** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on C3 and the acidic α-hydrogen on C2 are eliminated. This is a dehydration step.\n        This dehydration is favorable because it forms a stable conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde).\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option C).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overall transformation is:\n4-aminophenylacetaldehyde → [diazonium salt] → 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde → 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all three steps, including the heating step. The heat drives the reaction to the dehydrated condensation product, which is more stable than the initial aldol addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product.\n\n**1.

The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which, according to the n+1 rule, means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group). This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary **amine group (-NH2)**. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and proton exchange.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group. It appears as a doublet (d), confirming it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This reinforces the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    Combining the fragments, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amine group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n**2. Follow the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   This is the standard set of reagents for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The intermediate formed is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming causes **hydrolysis**.

KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde with acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group. Reacting it with a strong base (KOH) and heat are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   First, the base removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   Crucially, the reaction is **heated**. Heat promotes the **dehydration** (elimination of a water molecule) of the β-hydroxy aldehyde to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe final product is the result of the self-condensation of two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The structure formed is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Naming the structure:** The main chain is a butenal (a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond). The aldehyde carbon is C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it a `but-2-enal`. There are 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents at positions C2 and C4.\n*   The correct IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**4.

The presence of an oxygen atom suggests a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-) with two protons. The splitting is a doublet (d), indicating it is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a -CH- group). This confirms the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment, as the methylene protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to two protons. This pattern is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This chemical shift and broadening are typical for the protons of a primary amine group (-NH₂), which undergo rapid exchange.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde side chain (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   Intermediate A: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water and gently warming the solution causes the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt.

KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the aldehyde from step 2 with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the product of the Aldol Condensation.**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-part process: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The product of this addition step would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the initial aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This dehydration forms a new carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.

The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The product after this step is (4-(formylmethyl)phenyl)diazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat**\n    The diazonium salt is treated with water and heated, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).

These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation reaction. Since heat is applied, the reaction proceeds through both an aldol addition and a subsequent dehydration.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** A base-generated enolate of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the initially formed β-hydroxy aldehyde eliminates a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final product after the elimination of water is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; lacks hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the expected product from the aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product before dehydration. Since heat is applied, this is not the final product.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure resulting from a different type of reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.

A primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt. In this step, the amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-), forming 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, often with gentle warming, results in a hydrolysis reaction. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step converts the intermediate into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves an aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the aldehyde group. In the presence of a strong base like potassium hydroxide (KOH), it will undergo self-condensation.\n    *   The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. In this case, it would be 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe final product is the result of the dehydration of the aldol addition product. The dehydration occurs by removing the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) and a proton from the alpha-carbon (C2), creating a double bond between C2 and C3.\n\nThe resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.

The triplet multiplicity means it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n*   **Alkyl Chain:** The signal at 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) corresponds to a -CH2- group. The doublet multiplicity confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton.\n\nCombining these fragments, the starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** Adding water and typically warming the solution causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The -N2+ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting the product from step 2, an aldehyde with α-hydrogens, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an aldol condensation reaction. In this reaction, two molecules of the aldehyde react with each other.\n    *   **Addition:** First, an aldol addition occurs, where one molecule acts as a nucleophile (after being deprotonated by KOH) and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because heat is applied, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination step is favored as it creates a stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The dehydration of the intermediate yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3.

Since there is nitrogen in the formula and it integrates to 2H, this is an amino group (-NH2). The amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring with `-NH2` and `-CH2CHO` substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's check the formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The `-NH2` group is converted into a diazonium salt, `-N2+Cl-`.\n    The intermediate formed is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    When a diazonium salt is treated with water (and usually warmed), the `-N2+` group is replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group via a Sandmeyer-type reaction. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    The intermediate formed is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde has acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields an aldol addition product.\n        *   Enolate Formation: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH-  ⇌ [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O\n        *   Nucleophilic Attack: The enolate attacks another aldehyde molecule.\n        *   Protonation: Forms the aldol adduct, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** indicates that the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxy aldehyde will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated.\n        *   Adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n        *   Elimination: This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n        *   Final Product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The phenyl groups should have hydroxyl substituents, and the double bond position is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This is the α,β-unsaturated product from the complete aldol condensation. The structure and name match the expected final product.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: This structure does not result from the described reaction pathway.\n\nThe final product of the complete reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is typical of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region is indicative of an amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). It is a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton, which aligns with the aldehyde proton's triplet splitting. This -CH2- group is positioned between the aromatic ring and the aldehyde group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments, the starting compound is identified as **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. The chemical shifts of the aromatic protons are consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing an electron-donating group (-NH2) and an electron-withdrawing group (-CH2CHO).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reagent mixture is used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium chloride group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    The addition of water and warming of the diazonium salt solution leads to a hydrolysis reaction (a type of Sandmeyer reaction). The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water. The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**, also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). In the presence of a strong base like KOH, it will undergo a self-condensation reaction.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option B).\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration occurs between the α and β carbons to form a conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) yields a molecule with a double bond between carbon 2 and carbon 3 of the butanal chain.\n\nThe resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DBE is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This is the chemical shift for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n        *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It's split into a doublet by the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The fragments are a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling these gives **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n    *   **Step 1 & 2: `1. NaNO2 + HCl` followed by `2. H2O`**: This is a standard two-step process for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine followed by hydrolysis. The aromatic amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) upon warming with water. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n        *   Intermediate Product: The -NH2 group on 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde is converted to an -OH group, yielding **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: `aq. KOH, Heat`**: This step involves reacting the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, with a base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde forms an enolate (by the base removing an α-hydrogen). This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbonyl of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this addition product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option D).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The hydroxyl group at the β-position (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-position (C2) are eliminated.\n        *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure matches option B.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    The question asks for the *final product*. Given the condition \"Heat\", the reaction will proceed to the more stable condensation product rather than stopping at the addition product. Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the starting material from the provided molecular formula and NMR data.\n# Molecular Formula: C8H9NO\n# NMR Data:\n# 9.72 (t, 1H): Aldehyde proton (-CHO) next to a CH2.\n# 6.98 (d, 2H) & 6.51 (d, 2H): Para-substituted benzene ring.\n# 6.27 (bs, 2H): Primary amine (-NH2).\n# 3.66 (d, 2H): CH2 group next to the aldehyde.\n# Conclusion for Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.\n# Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO2/HCl followed by H2O converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a phenol (Ar-OH).\n# So, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde becomes 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n# Reaction 3: aq.

KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   This aldehyde possesses acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group. These conditions are ideal for a self-condensation reaction known as the **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This addition reaction initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (B), which is the aldol addition product.\n    *   However, the reaction is heated, which promotes a dehydration (or condensation) step. A molecule of water is eliminated to form a more stable, conjugated system. The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final product, after the complete three-step sequence including the heat-induced condensation, is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.

Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** 5. This indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to a single proton (the aldehyde proton).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** The data corresponds to **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The structure consists of a para-substituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) as the two substituents.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is converted to 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    Heating the diazonium salt in water results in hydrolysis, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This set of reagents promotes an aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The reaction first proceeds through an aldol addition, where the enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" is crucial. Heating the aldol addition product in a basic solution causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination is strongly favored because it forms a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, a known compound.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction proceeds to the most stable product under the given conditions. The heat applied in the final step drives the reaction from the initial aldol adduct (Option D) to the dehydrated, conjugated condensation product (Option C).\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identification of the Starting Material:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₈H₉NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2\\*8 + 2 + 1 - 9) / 2 = 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=O or C=C bond).\n    *   The ¹H-NMR data provides key structural clues:\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH₂- group. The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the presence of a -CH₂-CHO group (a phenylacetaldehyde fragment).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are classic indicators of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   Assembling these fragments, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The structure is consistent with the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 4-formylmethylbenzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   **Step 2: H₂O, Heat:** Treating an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt with heat results in its hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction converts the diazonium salt intermediate into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that possesses acidic α-protons (on the carbon between the ring and the carbonyl group). In the presence of a base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-aldol condensation.\n        *   First, the base removes an α-proton to form an enolate ion.\n        *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (structure D).\n        *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). A double bond is formed between the α and β carbons, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This product is particularly stable due to the extended conjugation between the aromatic rings, the newly formed C=C double bond, and the C=O group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation with dehydration to yield the final product.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Intermediate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Final Product (after aldol condensation):** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct structure is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely from a carbonyl group (C=O), which fits with the NMR data.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a CH group (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks). This CH is the aldehyde proton. These two signals confirm the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment (an acetaldehyde group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region that integrates to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (**-NH₂**).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -CH₂-CHO group.\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (from the ring) + C₂H₃O (from acetaldehyde group) + NH₂ = C₈H₉NO. The structure matches the formula and all NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    1.  The first step (NaNO₂ + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        *   Intermediate: 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  The second step is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt by adding water and warming. The -N₂⁺ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by an -OH group.\n        *   Product after steps 1 & 2: The amine is converted to a phenol. The molecule is now **(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    1.  The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The molecule, (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, has an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde). This is the classic condition for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Subsequent protonation yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   The addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    3.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-hydrogen (on C-2) is removed, and the β-hydroxy group (on C-3) is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated double bond between the α and β carbons.\n        *   Final Product: The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the given options.**\n\n*   The final product derived from the complete reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   This matches option **C**.\n\n    *   Option A is the intermediate aldol addition product, before the heat-induced dehydration step.\n    *   Options B and D are structurally incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   A value around 7 ppm typically indicates aromatic protons. The two doublets at 6.98 ppm (2H) and 6.51 ppm (2H) are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   A signal at 9.72 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment. The C=O bond of the aldehyde accounts for the remaining 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The signal at 3.66 ppm is a doublet (d) integrating to 2H. This corresponds to the -CH2- protons, which are coupled to the single aldehyde proton, hence the doublet splitting.\n    *   The broad singlet (bs) at 6.27 ppm (2H) is typical for an amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group as substituents. The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   First, the primary aromatic amine (4-aminophenylacetaldehyde) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt. This is the **diazotization reaction**.\n        H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO + NaNO2/HCl → [N2]+-C6H4-CH2CHO\n    *   Second, the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with water (H2O), often with gentle warming, to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        [N2]+-C6H4-CH2CHO + H2O → HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + H+\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This set of reagents is used for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde that has α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group), it will undergo a self-condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Aldol Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. This condition promotes the dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) from the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxyl group and an α-proton are removed to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by conjugation of the new C=C double bond with both the C=O group and one of the phenyl rings.\n        3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe final, most stable product formed under conditions of heat is the condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n*   The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heat.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure. Lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n    *   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This is the correct structure and name for the aldol condensation product.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it results from a different reaction and has only one hydroxyphenyl group.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**1.

A DBE of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting means it's adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), as per the n+1 rule.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic sign of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. Their upfield shift (compared to benzene at ~7.26 ppm) implies the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). An amine group is a potent EDG, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene (-CH₂-) group. The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which must be the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** The compound is a para-substituted benzene ring with an -NH₂ group and a -CH₂CHO group. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The carbonyl C=O accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe identified starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Steps 1 & 2: 1.

This compound is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to create a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. (This intermediate would be option B).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is conducted with **heat**. The heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. An α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a new, stable C=C double bond conjugated with both the benzene ring and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The final product is therefore the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the Final Product to the Options**\n\nThe structure derived, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, corresponds directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound C8H9NO from the given NMR data.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 typically suggests a benzene ring (DoU = 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or a ring).\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

This structure is consistent with the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence:**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻), forming 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt solution (often with gentle warming) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction converts the diazonium salt into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are classic conditions for an aldol condensation. An aldol reaction is a reaction between two molecules of an aldehyde (or ketone) that have α-hydrogens.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde forms an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" condition strongly suggests that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are eliminated to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThe initial NMR data identifies the starting compound as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The three-step reaction sequence first converts this to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde via a diazotization-hydrolysis sequence. The final step is a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Due to the application of heat, the final product is the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\n*   Aldol addition product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n*   Final condensation product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this to the given options, the final product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and triplet splitting pattern are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula C₈H₉NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2 (1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O):** This is a standard two-step process for converting a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   The primary amine on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde reacts with NaNO₂ and HCl to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   Heating the diazonium salt in water replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product of this stage is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation** reaction.\n    *   The term \"aldol\" refers to reactions between aldehydes or ketones. Since we have only one type of aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH₂- group), it will undergo a self-condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol *addition* product. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation:** The reaction conditions explicitly include **heat**. Heating an aldol reaction drives a dehydration (elimination of water) reaction to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is known as the aldol *condensation* product. When you see \"heat\" specified in an aldol reaction, the condensation product is the expected final product.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal forms a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3), resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nBased on the reaction sequence, the initial aldol addition product (C) is formed and then subsequently dehydrated due to the heat, yielding the aldol condensation product (D).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Intermediate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Aldol Addition Product:** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Structure C)\n*   **Final Condensation Product (with heat):** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal (Structure D)\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all three steps, including heating with KOH. Therefore, the condensation product is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe final product is correctly identified through a three-step chemical analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Starting Compound\n\nThe molecular formula of the initial compound is C8H9NO. The provided ¹H-NMR data is analyzed to determine its structure:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are classic indicators of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to two protons strongly suggests a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nCombining these fragments gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**, which is consistent with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a series of reactions:\n\n1.  **NaNO₂, HCl:** This mixture forms nitrous acid (HNO₂) in situ. It reacts with the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) in a process called diazotization to form a diazonium salt. The product of this step is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water and gentle warming leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas. This converts the molecule into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** The resulting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is then treated with aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat. This sets up the conditions for a self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n### Step 3: The Aldol Condensation\n\nIn the presence of a strong base (KOH), an alpha-proton from the -CH2- group of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is removed to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n*   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions is a strong indicator that the reaction does not stop at the addition stage. The β-hydroxy aldehyde readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. An α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is formed.\n\nThe final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound has a double bond between the second and third carbons, conjugated with both the aldehyde group and one of the hydroxyphenyl rings.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) indicate a strong electron-donating group is attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as this CH2 group is coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling them gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n    Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the molecular formula.\n    The starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (hydrolysis), typically upon gentle warming. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This is a self-aldol condensation reaction. 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde).\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH- from KOH) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   The structure of the addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with heating. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n        *   The structure of the condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe question asks for the *final* product. The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly indicates that the reaction proceeds to the more stable, dehydrated condensation product, rather than stopping at the aldol addition stage.\n\nLet's check the options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final aldol condensation product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is identified by first determining the structure of the starting material and then analyzing the subsequent reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting compound is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 units) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group).\n\nThe 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the aldehyde region. The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This corresponds to a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts suggest the presence of an electron-donating group.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the -CH2- group that is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with both the molecular formula and all the NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate formed is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle heating, results in the hydrolysis of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an alpha-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This addition reaction forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a proton from the α-carbon are removed, creating a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration step is generally favorable as it leads to a conjugated system. The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is the final, stable product of the aldol condensation reaction under heating.\n\nComparing this structure to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - Matches the predicted final product.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which dehydrates upon heating.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents and structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material (C8H9NO):**\n    *   First, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get a clue about the structure. DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n    *   Next, I'll analyze the 1H-NMR signals:\n        *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This is a classic aldehyde (-CHO) proton signal. The triplet (t) means it's adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n        *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n        *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: A methylene (-CH2-) group. The doublet (d) indicates it's adjacent to a single proton, which confirms it's next to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n    *   Putting it all together: We have a para-substituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group. This gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** These are the reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   **Step 2: H2O, Heat:** Adding water and heat to a diazonium salt results in its hydrolysis, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This provides a strong base (OH-) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). These are the perfect conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   In an aldol condensation, the base (KOH) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms an aldol addition product: `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal` (which is option B).\n    *   However, the reaction is performed with **heat**.

An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CH₂-CHO, -NH₂, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring), we can assemble the structure. The two substituents on the benzene ring are the amino group and the acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO.

KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms an aldol addition product.\n        *   Enolate: `[HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻`\n        *   Electrophile: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO`\n        *   Addition Product (after protonation): `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal` (This corresponds to option B).\n\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The presence of **heat** strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n        *   Adduct: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C4)-CH(OH)(C3)-CH(C₂)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(C1)`\n        *   Elimination of H₂O gives a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        *   Final Product: `HO-C₆H₄-CH₂(C4)-CH(C3)=C(C₂)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(C1)`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe final product of the aldol condensation (under heat) is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Let's name this structure:\n*   The parent chain is a butenal (4-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond).\n*   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a but-2-enal.\n*   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C2.\n*   There is a 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C4.\n*   The systematic name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect.

This matches our derived structure.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure and stoichiometry.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring. The presence of an aldehyde group (C=O) would account for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent group with 2 protons (n+1 rule, n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons. The multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to an adjacent group with 1 proton (n=1). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the -CH2- protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4- or para-disubstituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts (normal benzene is ~7.3 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, which causes the signal to be broad. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H9NO.

The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **H2O, Heat:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water, which hydrolyzes it. The -N₂⁺ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n    *   This two-step process effectively converts the starting 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal into **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n    *   **aq. KOH:** Potassium hydroxide is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon to form an enolate ion.\n    *   This enolate ion is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This is a self-**aldol addition** reaction.\n    *   The product of the addition is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    *   **Heat:** The reaction is heated. Aldol addition products readily undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) under heat, especially when the resulting product is conjugated. This step is called **aldol condensation**.\n    *   The β-hydroxy aldehyde eliminates water (the -OH from C3 and an acidic H from C2) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The formation of the C=C double bond creates a conjugated system (phenyl-C=C-C=O), which is thermodynamically very stable and drives the reaction to completion.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n\nThe reaction sequence leads to an aldol condensation product.\n*   Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n*   Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n*   Aldol Addition Product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D)\n*   Final Condensation Product (due to heat): **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option A)\n\nSince the conditions specify \"Heat\", the final isolated product will be the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees, leaving one degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

Its coupling to the aldehyde proton (a single proton) explains the doublet multiplicity.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for diazotization. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The aldehyde group remains unaffected. The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound has both an aldehyde group and α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), which are the classic requirements for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    *   However, the presence of **heat** strongly favors the subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) of this aldol addition product. This elimination results in the formation of a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, leads to the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. The resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **But-2-enal:** A four-carbon chain with an aldehyde at position 1 and a double bond starting at position 2.\n*   **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl):** A 4-hydroxyphenyl group is attached to carbon 2, and another is attached to carbon 4.\n\nThis structure matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant from its molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region, combined with the reaction conditions (diazotization), points to a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a -CH2- group adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This fits perfectly with the -CH2-CHO fragment, where this -CH2- is coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments—a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group—leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, undergoes a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   The first reagent, NaNO2 and HCl, is used for diazotization, which converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    *   The subsequent addition of water (H₂O) and warming hydrolyzes the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages: an initial aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen (from the -CH2- group) of one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (structure corresponding to option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon and a hydrogen on the α-carbon are removed, forming a double bond.

This is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (16 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=C or C=O).\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region suggests a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH2-) that is coupled to a single proton, which would be the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:** Based on the fragments identified (a para-disubstituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** These reagents are used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   Product after step 1: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** Adding water to the diazonium salt and typically warming the mixture results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Nitrogen gas is evolved during this process.\n    *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which are the requirements for an aldol condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is a known entity, and its synthesis and properties have been described in the literature.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Because the reaction is heated, the final product is the dehydrated, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, not the intermediate aldol addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) - 0/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Under these conditions, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by the extended conjugation between the benzene ring, the new C=C double bond, and the C=O double bond.\n\n    *   **Final Product Structure:**\n        The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in the formation of a double bond between the α-carbon (C2) and β-carbon (C3).\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate.

The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons, which is exchangeable with D2O (implied by the presence of N and O), is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1). This proton is the aldehyde proton, confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group is transformed into -N2+Cl-.\n    The intermediate is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis of Diazonium Salt)**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt (usually with gentle heating) causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). The -N2+ is an excellent leaving group, evolving as N2 gas.\n    The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves treating an aldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The aldehyde, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH2- group). This is a classic setup for an **aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product. This product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n    4.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water). The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product structure.**\n\n*   The aldol addition product is: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n    ```\n          OH\n          |\n    HO-Ph-CH2-CH - CH - CHO\n                   |\n                   Ph-OH\n    (where Ph = C6H4)\n    ```\n*   Dehydration of this intermediate (elimination of H2O) gives the final condensation product:\n    ```\n    HO-Ph-CH2-C = C - CHO\n                  |\n                  Ph-OH\n    ```\n*   The IUPAC name for this final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration (condensation). This is the correct answer.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure; the hydroxyl groups are missing.\n\nThe final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Compound (C8H9NO)**\n\nFirst, we must identify the initial reactant from its molecular formula and the provided 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    *   DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule. This identifies a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents the two protons of a -CH₂- group. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), confirming it is adjacent to a carbon with a single proton (the aldehyde's CH). This further confirms the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment. The chemical shift suggests this CH₂ is attached to an electron-withdrawing group, such as the aromatic ring.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The protons are exchangeable, and the signal is broadened by the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    By combining the identified fragments—a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an amine group (-NH₂), and an ethanal group (-CH₂CHO)—we can determine the structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we will trace the transformations of 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal through the given reaction steps.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    This is a well-known two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH₂) reacts with nitrous acid (formed from NaNO₂ and HCl) to create a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is unstable and, upon warming in water, is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde that possesses acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group. Treating it with a strong base (KOH) and heat initiates an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base removes an alpha-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This results in the formation of an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option A, but it is an intermediate).\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on carbon-3 and the proton on carbon-2 are removed, forming a stable C=C double bond. This dehydration is favorable because the resulting double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the complete aldol condensation.\n*   The main carbon chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde at C1, double bond).\n*   The double bond is between C2 and C3, making it a **but-2-enal**.\n*   A **(4-hydroxyphenyl)** group is attached to C2.\n*   A **(4-hydroxyphenyl)** group is attached to C4.\n*   The systematic name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (DBE=4) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO).

This is consistent with the -CH2-CHO fragment, where the CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is appropriate for a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.

KOH, Heat:** This is a strong base with heat. The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, has an aldehyde group with acidic α-protons (on the CH2 group). This is a classic condition for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, it will be a self-condensation.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the product of the aldol condensation.**\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two main stages: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n1.  **Aldol Addition:**\n    *   The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n    *   Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the aldol addition product.\n    *   The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n\n     \n\n2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):**\n    *   The reaction conditions include **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product.\n    *   The base (OH-) removes the acidic proton from the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (C2).

The molecular formula C8H9NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-), forming 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride. This reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** Adding water and warming the solution hydrolyzes the diazonium salt.

The Aldol Condensation Product**\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. In this case, the addition product would be 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option B).\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes a subsequent dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The acidic α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n*   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nBased on this three-step reaction sequence, the final product is the result of the aldol condensation, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant from its molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C8H9NO):** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5.

Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction under heat to yield the final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound from the given data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (e.g., C=O, C=C).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons, meaning it's next to a -CH₂- group. This confirms a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH₂- group protons. The doublet (d) splitting indicates that these two protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton, which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the **-CH₂-CHO** fragment. The chemical shift is appropriate for a methylene group attached to both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, is a hallmark of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2H, which disappears on D₂O exchange (a common characteristic though not explicitly stated), is indicative of an amine group **(-NH₂) **. An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde fragment (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (H₂N-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n\n*   **Reagent 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (at 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) reacts to form a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride ([⁺N≡N]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO Cl⁻)\n\n*   **Reagent 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water (often with gentle warming) to the diazonium salt results in hydrolysis, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base with heat. The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH₂- group). These are the conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   First, the phenolic proton will be deprotonated by KOH, but the aldol reaction will proceed on the aldehyde part of the molecule.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate.\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is the structure in option A).\n        3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is **heated**, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The proton on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the beta-carbon (C3) is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product, not just the initial addition product, due to the heating condition.\n\n*   Option A, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate.\n*   Option B, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, is the final condensation product.\n*   Options C and D are structurally incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** 5 (suggesting a benzene ring and one other double bond, likely a carbonyl group).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde's single proton, hence it appears as a doublet. This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are a classic sign of a para-disubstituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nAssembling these fragments, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n2.  **H₂O:** Water is added to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction, sometimes called the Sandmeyer reaction (though technically just hydrolysis), forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** The product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α-carbon (the CH₂ group) of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This initially forms an aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The final product of this condensation is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This specific compound has been synthesized and studied for its biological activities.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all reaction steps, including heating. The heat drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable, dehydrated condensation product over the simple addition product.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because the hydroxyl groups are missing and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   **Option B** is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would be isolated under milder conditions without heat.\n*   **Option C** is the final aldol condensation product, resulting from dehydration of the adduct, which is expected under heating.\n*   **Option D** is an incorrect structure that would not be formed from this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed via aldol condensation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Starting Material:** The first step is to determine the structure of the starting compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided 1H-NMR data.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU). DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DoU=4) and one other double bond or ring (DoU=1).\n    *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This is a very characteristic signal for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it's adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1 rule, 2 protons + 1 = 3 peaks). So, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the CH2 group. It's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1 proton + 1 = 2 peaks), confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Putting it all together:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the -NH2 group, and the other is the -CH2-CHO group. This gives us 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. It matches perfectly. The double bond in the C=O of the aldehyde accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:** Now, let's see what happens when 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is subjected to the given reagents.\n    *   **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O):** This is the classic two-step procedure for converting a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n        *   Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl): The primary amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n        *   Step 2 (H2O, usually with heat): The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group.\n        *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This is a strong base with heat. The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the hydrogens on the CH2 group). These are the perfect conditions for a self-**aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option C).\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly suggests that the aldol addition product will not be the final product. The initial adduct will readily dehydrate (lose a molecule of water) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group leaves, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n        *   The final dehydrated product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n3.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (should be hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, stable aldol condensation product formed after dehydration. This matches our derived structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product is D.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_reaction_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step thought process to identify the final product of the chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the starting compound from molecular formula and NMR data.\n    start_compound_name = \"4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\"\n    reasoning_step1 = [\n        \"1.

The C=O of an aldehyde would account for this.\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift (>9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH₂-CHO group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1).

The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts, particularly the upfield signal at 6.51 ppm, suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG) on the ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂). An amino group is a strong EDG, which explains the observed aromatic shifts.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.

When warmed, diazonium salts hydrolyze, and the -N₂⁺ group (an excellent leaving group) is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a type of Sandmeyer-like reaction.\n        *   *Intermediate 2:* **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the product from step 2 (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the carbonyl). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** A base (OH⁻ from KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            *   The addition product is: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. (This corresponds to option A).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-hydrogen (at C-2) and the β-hydroxyl group (at C-3) are removed to form a double bond. This process is called dehydration or condensation. The resulting product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            *   The condensation product is: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. (This corresponds to option B).\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product.**\n    *   The term \"aldol condensation\" technically refers to the two-step process of addition followed by dehydration. The presence of heat strongly favors the dehydration step because the resulting conjugated system (the C=C double bond is conjugated with both the C=O of the aldehyde and one of the phenyl rings) is thermodynamically very stable.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition product (A), but will proceed to the more stable condensation product (B).\n    *   Option C is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups.\n    *   Option D is incorrect as it is not a dimerization product and has the wrong number of carbon atoms.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration promoted by heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, X is the number of halogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n    *   DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond or ring. The C=O of an aldehyde or ketone would account for the fifth DBE.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons (a -CH2- group) according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons. Its broadness suggests it's due to exchangeable protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, this signal is very likely from a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. The splitting is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH- group). This fits perfectly with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment we proposed earlier: the two protons of the CH2 group are coupled to the single proton of the CHO group, resulting in a doublet.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    *   We have the following pieces: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amine group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde side chain (-CH2-CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the pieces add up to the molecular formula: C6H4 + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n    *   The two substituents on the para-disubstituted ring must be the -NH2 group and the -CH2CHO group.\n    *   The structure is therefore **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (or p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, Heat**\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (at 0-5°C): Diazotization.** This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n        *   Intermediate: 4-(diazoniomethyl)phenylacetaldehyde chloride `([Cl⁻][N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)`\n    2.  **H2O, Heat: Hydrolysis.** Heating the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to hydrolyze. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n        *   Product after steps 1 & 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `(HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat applied to an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the -CHO group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, also known as an aldol adduct.\n        *   Adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option A.\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The \"Heat\" condition indicates that the reaction will not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct will readily lose a molecule of water (dehydrate) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated, forming a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        *   This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO. The ¹H-NMR data provides the following information:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons, consistent with a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n\nAssembling these fragments (a p-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and a -CH2CHO group) leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    Primary aromatic amines react with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) to form diazonium salts. The amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium group (-N₂⁺).\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 4-(diazoniumchloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has both an aldehyde and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which are the required components for an aldol condensation.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (aldol addition).\n    3.  The resulting β-hydroxy aldehyde is named 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (A).\n    4.  The \"Heat\" condition promotes the dehydration (loss of a water molecule) of the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. This elimination reaction creates a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n    *   *Final Product:* The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the starting material and the reaction sequence, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\nThe step-by-step analysis of the reaction is as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   9.72 ppm (t, 1H): This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   3.66 ppm (d, 2H): This doublet corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methine (-CH-) group, in this case, the aldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The para-substituted ring contains an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2CHO group. The formula C8H9NO and the NMR splitting patterns are consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**: This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is transformed into the corresponding arenediazonium salt, (4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**: Treating the diazonium salt with water leads to its hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**: This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The molecule possesses acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group), making it susceptible to an aldol reaction.\n    *   An enolate is formed when the hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Product A).\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination is favorable as it results in a highly conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde). The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the multi-step synthesis, the final product is the result of the aldol condensation, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting (t) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a -CH₂- group. The doublet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The NMR data aligns perfectly with this structure: the amine and the acetaldehyde group are para to each other on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    *   This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The intermediate formed is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt and typically warming the mixture results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This step produces **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation. An aldol condensation is a two-part reaction: an aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from the -CH₂- group of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms an aldol addition product, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on carbon 3 and the acidic proton on carbon 2 are removed, forming a double bond. This results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence converts 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction. Given the application of heat in the final step, the reaction proceeds to completion to form the dehydrated condensation product, not just the initial addition product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 units of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring. The signals in the aromatic region (6-8 ppm) confirm the benzene ring. The extra unit of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), as suggested by the very downfield aldehyde proton.\n\n    *   **Analysis of 1H-NMR Data:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a CH2 group. This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1=2, so n=1). The chemical shift of ~3.6 ppm is consistent with a methylene group attached to both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (benzylic and α to carbonyl).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is indicative of an amine group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH). Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is an -NH2 group.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group.\n        The structure is therefore **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify this structure against the data:\n        - Formula: C6H4 (ring) + CH2 + CHO + NH2 = C8H9NO. (Correct)\n        - NMR: The electron-donating -NH2 group shields the ortho protons (making them appear upfield, ~6.51 ppm), while the weakly electron-withdrawing -CH2CHO group results in the other aromatic protons appearing more downfield (~6.98 ppm). The -CH2CHO fragment protons match the observed coupling (d and t). The -NH2 protons appear as a broad singlet. The structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This reagent mixture, typically used at low temperatures (0-5 °C), converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n        The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-).\n        **Intermediate A:** 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Aqueous diazonium salts are generally unstable. Upon warming, they react with water to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, liberating nitrogen gas (N2).\n        **Intermediate B:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        We now have an aldehyde (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde) in the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an aldol condensation reaction.\n        The aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- group).\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n        3.  **Aldol Addition Product:** The structure of this initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are removed. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        5.  **Final Product:** The elimination of water results in the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is a highly stable conjugated system (the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings), so its formation is strongly favored under heat. This structure corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion**\n\n    The question asks for the final product of the entire reaction sequence. The aldol reaction under heat proceeds through the addition product (structure C) to the final, more stable dehydrated condensation product (structure B). Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect stoichiometry; this product contains only one phenyl ring, whereas the self-condensation uses two molecules of the starting aldehyde.\n    *   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final product of the aldol condensation (dehydration of the aldol adduct). This is the most likely answer.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, formed before the heat-induced dehydration step. It is not the final product.\n    *   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents; the -NH2 group was converted to an -OH group, so the final product should have hydroxyphenyl rings, not phenyl rings.\n\nThus, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 DBE) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O or C=C bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a CH2 group). This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) splitting is caused by the single aldehyde proton. This further confirms the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic sign of a **para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). An amine is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group.\n    Attaching these to a benzene ring gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C (from CH2) + C (from CHO) + NH2 + H (from CH2) + H (from CHO) = **C8H9NO**. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A):** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reagent mixture converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). This reaction is typically performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    The product (Intermediate B) is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt and warming it up causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    The product (Intermediate C) is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation reaction.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen (from the CH2 group) of one molecule to form an enolate ion.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    3.  **Dehydration:** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on C3 and the acidic α-hydrogen on C2 are eliminated. This is a dehydration step.\n        This dehydration is favorable because it forms a stable conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde).\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option C).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe overall transformation is:\n4-aminophenylacetaldehyde → [diazonium salt] → 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde → 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all three steps, including the heating step. The heat drives the reaction to the dehydrated condensation product, which is more stable than the initial aldol addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product.\n\n**1.

It appears as a doublet (d), confirming it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This reinforces the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    Combining the fragments, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an amine group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) as substituents. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n**2.

Reacting it with a strong base (KOH) and heat are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   First, the base removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   Crucially, the reaction is **heated**. Heat promotes the **dehydration** (elimination of a water molecule) of the β-hydroxy aldehyde to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3.

This chemical shift and broadening are typical for the protons of a primary amine group (-NH₂), which undergo rapid exchange.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH₂) and a phenylacetaldehyde side chain (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   Putting these pieces together, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   Intermediate A: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    *   Adding water and gently warming the solution causes the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Intermediate B: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the aldehyde from step 2 with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the product of the Aldol Condensation.**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-part process: aldol addition followed by dehydration.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The product of this addition step would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the initial aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This dehydration forms a new carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. The new double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and one of the aromatic rings, making it a very stable product.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the Options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect connectivity.\n*   B) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** - This matches the structure of the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl).\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final *condensation* product formed under heat.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the 1H-NMR data provides the following signals:\n*   **Analysis of the Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C8H9NO has 5 degrees of unsaturation, which strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group, C=O).\n*   **Analysis of the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals in the aromatic region are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The presence of the electron-donating amine group on the ring explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons, consistent with a benzylic methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with both the molecular formula and all the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The product after this step is (4-(formylmethyl)phenyl)diazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat**\n    The diazonium salt is treated with water and heated, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation reaction. Since heat is applied, the reaction proceeds through both an aldol addition and a subsequent dehydration.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** A base-generated enolate of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the initially formed β-hydroxy aldehyde eliminates a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final product after the elimination of water is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; lacks hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the expected product from the aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product before dehydration. Since heat is applied, this is not the final product.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure resulting from a different type of reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a single proton, which is consistent with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we will trace the starting material through the three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for diazotization. A primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt. In this step, the amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-), forming 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n\n2.  **H2O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, often with gentle warming, results in a hydrolysis reaction. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This step converts the intermediate into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves an aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the aldehyde group. In the presence of a strong base like potassium hydroxide (KOH), it will undergo self-condensation.\n    *   The base (OH-) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. In this case, it would be 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe final product is the result of the dehydration of the aldol addition product. The dehydration occurs by removing the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) and a proton from the alpha-carbon (C2), creating a double bond between C2 and C3.\n\nThe resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound, C8H9NO, from its 1H-NMR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals at 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Amine Group:** The broad singlet at 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) indicates a primary amino group (-NH2) attached to the aromatic ring.\n*   **Aldehyde Group:** The signal far downfield at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) is a classic aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity means it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n*   **Alkyl Chain:** The signal at 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) corresponds to a -CH2- group. The doublet multiplicity confirms it is adjacent to the single aldehyde proton.\n\nCombining these fragments, the starting material is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl:** This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n*   **Step 2: H2O:** Adding water and typically warming the solution causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The -N2+ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting the product from step 2, an aldehyde with α-hydrogens, with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an aldol condensation reaction. In this reaction, two molecules of the aldehyde react with each other.\n    *   **Addition:** First, an aldol addition occurs, where one molecule acts as a nucleophile (after being deprotonated by KOH) and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because heat is applied, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination step is favored as it creates a stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The dehydration of the intermediate yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe presence of heat in the final step drives the reaction to completion, favoring the formation of the more stable dehydrated condensation product over the simple addition product. Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and its 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (1H coupled to 2H).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is the aldehyde proton. The chemical shift indicates it is attached to both the aldehyde group and an aromatic ring.\n    *   From these two signals, we can deduce a `-CH2-CHO` (phenylacetaldehyde) fragment. The double bond of the aldehyde carbonyl (C=O) accounts for the remaining 1 DBE.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, strongly suggest a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, which disappears upon D2O exchange, is characteristic of an exchangeable proton source like an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2). Since there is nitrogen in the formula and it integrates to 2H, this is an amino group (-NH2). The amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring with `-NH2` and `-CH2CHO` substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's check the formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) -> C8H9NO. This is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The `-NH2` group is converted into a diazonium salt, `-N2+Cl-`.\n    The intermediate formed is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    When a diazonium salt is treated with water (and usually warmed), the `-N2+` group is replaced by a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group via a Sandmeyer-type reaction. Nitrogen gas (N2) is evolved.\n    The intermediate formed is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves reacting an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This aldehyde has acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields an aldol addition product.\n        *   Enolate Formation: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH-  ⇌ [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O\n        *   Nucleophilic Attack: The enolate attacks another aldehyde molecule.\n        *   Protonation: Forms the aldol adduct, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** indicates that the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxy aldehyde will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated.\n        *   Adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n        *   Elimination: This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n        *   Final Product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect. The phenyl groups should have hydroxyl substituents, and the double bond position is incorrect.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol *addition* product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This is the α,β-unsaturated product from the complete aldol condensation.

Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is typical of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region is indicative of an amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). It is a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton, which aligns with the aldehyde proton's triplet splitting. This -CH2- group is positioned between the aromatic ring and the aldehyde group.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Assembling these fragments, the starting compound is identified as **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. The chemical shifts of the aromatic protons are consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing an electron-donating group (-NH2) and an electron-withdrawing group (-CH2CHO).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    This reagent mixture is used to convert a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium chloride group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    The addition of water and warming of the diazonium salt solution leads to a hydrolysis reaction (a type of Sandmeyer reaction). The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water. The product of this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**, also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal possesses both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl). In the presence of a strong base like KOH, it will undergo a self-condensation reaction.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option B).\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration occurs between the α and β carbons to form a conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol addition product (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) yields a molecule with a double bond between carbon 2 and carbon 3 of the butanal chain.\n\nThe resulting structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula is C8H9NO. The DBE is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5`. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This is the chemical shift for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n        *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. It's split into a doublet by the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The fragments are a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group. Assembling these gives **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n    *   **Step 1 & 2: `1. NaNO2 + HCl` followed by `2. H2O`**: This is a standard two-step process for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine followed by hydrolysis. The aromatic amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is then replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) upon warming with water. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n        *   Intermediate Product: The -NH2 group on 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde is converted to an -OH group, yielding **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: `aq. KOH, Heat`**: This step involves reacting the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, with a base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde forms an enolate (by the base removing an α-hydrogen). This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbonyl of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde. The structure of this addition product would be **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option D).\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is performed with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favorable as it results in a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is more stable. The hydroxyl group at the β-position (C3) and a hydrogen from the α-position (C2) are eliminated.\n        *   **Final Product:** The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal leads to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure matches option B.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    The question asks for the *final product*. Given the condition \"Heat\", the reaction will proceed to the more stable condensation product rather than stopping at the addition product. Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the starting material from the provided molecular formula and NMR data.\n# Molecular Formula: C8H9NO\n# NMR Data:\n# 9.72 (t, 1H): Aldehyde proton (-CHO) next to a CH2.\n# 6.98 (d, 2H) & 6.51 (d, 2H): Para-substituted benzene ring.\n# 6.27 (bs, 2H): Primary amine (-NH2).\n# 3.66 (d, 2H): CH2 group next to the aldehyde.\n# Conclusion for Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.\n# Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO2/HCl followed by H2O converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a phenol (Ar-OH).\n# So, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde becomes 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n# Reaction 3: aq.

The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1=2, so n=1), which must be the aldehyde proton. This confirms the **-CH2-CHO** (acetaldehyde/ethanal) fragment. The chemical shift is appropriate for a benzylic -CH2- group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.

Mechanism of the Aldol Condensation.**\n*   **Step 3a: Aldol Addition.**\n    1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate: `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]`(-).\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    3.  Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n*   **Step 3b: Dehydration (Condensation).**\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product (the compound in Option D) undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule).\n    *   The base removes a proton from the alpha-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group is eliminated from the beta-carbon (C3).\n    *   Addition Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-(C4)-CH(OH)-(C3)-CH(C6H4-OH)-(C2)-CHO(C1)`\n    *   Elimination of H from C2 and OH from C3 forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   Condensation Product: `(HO-C6H4)-CH2-(C4)-CH=(C3)-C(C6H4-OH)-(C2)-CHO(C1)`\n    *   Let's name this final product. The parent chain is a but-2-enal. It has a (4-hydroxyphenyl) substituent on C2 and a (4-hydroxyphenyl) substituent on C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via diazotization/hydrolysis to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. While the initial addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option D), the application of heat drives the reaction to completion via dehydration, forming the more stable, conjugated final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal (Option A).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n**1.

This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (structure D).\n        *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). A double bond is formed between the α and β carbons, resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This product is particularly stable due to the extended conjugation between the aromatic rings, the newly formed C=C double bond, and the C=O group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction sequence transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation with dehydration to yield the final product.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Intermediate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Final Product (after aldol condensation):** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct structure is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.

The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a CH group (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks). This CH is the aldehyde proton. These two signals confirm the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment (an acetaldehyde group).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.

Subsequent protonation yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n        *   The addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    3.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-hydrogen (on C-2) is removed, and the β-hydroxy group (on C-3) is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated double bond between the α and β carbons.\n        *   Final Product: The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal results in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product among the given options.**\n\n*   The final product derived from the complete reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   This matches option **C**.\n\n    *   Option A is the intermediate aldol addition product, before the heat-induced dehydration step.\n    *   Options B and D are structurally incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2. For C8H9NO, this is 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4 = 5.\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Data Interpretation:**\n    *   A value around 7 ppm typically indicates aromatic protons. The two doublets at 6.98 ppm (2H) and 6.51 ppm (2H) are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   A signal at 9.72 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons, indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment. The C=O bond of the aldehyde accounts for the remaining 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The signal at 3.66 ppm is a doublet (d) integrating to 2H. This corresponds to the -CH2- protons, which are coupled to the single aldehyde proton, hence the doublet splitting.\n    *   The broad singlet (bs) at 6.27 ppm (2H) is typical for an amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group as substituents. The starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   First, the primary aromatic amine (4-aminophenylacetaldehyde) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt. This is the **diazotization reaction**.\n        H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO + NaNO2/HCl → [N2]+-C6H4-CH2CHO\n    *   Second, the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with water (H2O), often with gentle warming, to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        [N2]+-C6H4-CH2CHO + H2O → HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + H+\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This set of reagents is used for an **aldol condensation** reaction. Since there is only one type of aldehyde that has α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group), it will undergo a self-condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Aldol Addition Product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. This condition promotes the dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) from the aldol addition product. The β-hydroxyl group and an α-proton are removed to form a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced by conjugation of the new C=C double bond with both the C=O group and one of the phenyl rings.\n        3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal --(Heat, -H2O)--> **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe final, most stable product formed under conditions of heat is the condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n*   The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   Let's check the given options:\n    *   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heat.\n    *   B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure. Lacks the hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n    *   C) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This is the correct structure and name for the aldol condensation product.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; it results from a different reaction and has only one hydroxyphenyl group.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Compound**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5. A DBE of 5 strongly suggests a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n*   **¹H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting means it's adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), as per the n+1 rule.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic sign of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. Their upfield shift (compared to benzene at ~7.26 ppm) implies the presence of a strong electron-donating group (EDG).\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). An amine group is a potent EDG, which explains the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene (-CH₂-) group. The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which must be the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH₂-CHO` fragment.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** The compound is a para-substituted benzene ring with an -NH₂ group and a -CH₂CHO group. The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The carbonyl C=O accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe identified starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction.\n\n*   **Steps 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O**\n    This is the standard Sandmeyer-like reaction sequence to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (Diazotization): The -NH₂ group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   Step 2 (Hydrolysis): The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with water, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with an -OH group.\n    *   The product of this two-step process is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is now treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This compound is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for a **self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule to create a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. (This intermediate would be option B).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is conducted with **heat**. The heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. An α-hydrogen and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a new, stable C=C double bond conjugated with both the benzene ring and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The final product is therefore the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the Final Product to the Options**\n\nThe structure derived, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, corresponds directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound C8H9NO from the given NMR data.**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 typically suggests a benzene ring (DoU = 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or a ring).\n    *   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (below 7 ppm) suggest that the ring is substituted with at least one strong electron-donating group.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). An amino group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the aromatic proton shifts.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms its position adjacent to the aldehyde group (-CH2-CHO), as the CH2 protons are coupled to the CHO proton.\n    *   **Conclusion for the Starting Material:** Assembling the fragments (-NH2, a para-substituted benzene ring, and a -CH2CHO group) gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify its molecular formula: C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n    The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n    *   **1. NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        *   Intermediate after step 1: **4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride** ([Cl⁻][⁺N₂]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n    *   **2. H₂O:** The addition of water to an aryl diazonium salt, often with gentle warming, results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   Intermediate after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n    *   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl). Such aldehydes undergo a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product.\n            *   Aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n        *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heat provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in a highly stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group.\n            *   Dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal gives **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product.**\n    The question asks for the final product. Because the reaction is heated (condition 3), the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (product A). The dehydration step is favored under these conditions to form the more thermodynamically stable conjugated product.\n    *   The final product is the aldol condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This matches option B.\n    *   Option A is the intermediate before dehydration.\n    *   Option C has phenyl groups instead of hydroxyphenyl groups and an incorrect double bond position.\n    *   Option D has an incorrect structure that does not result from the self-condensation of two molecules.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation:** (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9) / 2 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees, suggesting a substituted benzene ring and one other double bond (e.g., C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This high chemical shift and triplet splitting pattern is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: A doublet for 2 protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the aldehyde's methine proton (-CH).\n*   **Structure Assembly:** Combining these fragments gives 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The structure is an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO) and an amino group (-NH₂) attached in a para orientation on a benzene ring. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence:**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻), forming 4-(diazonium)phenylacetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt solution (often with gentle warming) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction converts the diazonium salt into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are classic conditions for an aldol condensation. An aldol reaction is a reaction between two molecules of an aldehyde (or ketone) that have α-hydrogens.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde forms an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option A).\n    2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" condition strongly suggests that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are eliminated to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThe initial NMR data identifies the starting compound as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The three-step reaction sequence first converts this to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde via a diazotization-hydrolysis sequence. The final step is a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Due to the application of heat, the final product is the dehydrated condensation product, not the simple addition product.\n\n*   Aldol addition product: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n*   Final condensation product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this to the given options, the final product is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and triplet splitting pattern are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.

KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation** reaction.\n    *   The term \"aldol\" refers to reactions between aldehydes or ketones. Since we have only one type of aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH₂- group), it will undergo a self-condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol *addition* product. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation:** The reaction conditions explicitly include **heat**. Heating an aldol reaction drives a dehydration (elimination of water) reaction to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is known as the aldol *condensation* product.

The provided ¹H-NMR data is analyzed to determine its structure:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Its triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are classic indicators of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region integrating to two protons strongly suggests a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nCombining these fragments gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**, which is consistent with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a series of reactions:\n\n1.  **NaNO₂, HCl:** This mixture forms nitrous acid (HNO₂) in situ. It reacts with the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) in a process called diazotization to form a diazonium salt. The product of this step is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n2.  **H₂O:** The addition of water and gentle warming leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas. This converts the molecule into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** The resulting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is then treated with aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat. This sets up the conditions for a self-aldol condensation reaction.\n\n### Step 3: The Aldol Condensation\n\nIn the presence of a strong base (KOH), an alpha-proton from the -CH2- group of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is removed to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n*   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions is a strong indicator that the reaction does not stop at the addition stage. The β-hydroxy aldehyde readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. An α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is formed.\n\nThe final product after dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound has a double bond between the second and third carbons, conjugated with both the aldehyde group and one of the hydroxyphenyl rings.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
