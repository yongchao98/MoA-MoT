The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`), the image charge `q'` must be:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nSo, we have a simplified system of two point charges:\n*   The real charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin.\n*   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` at distance `b = R^2/d` from the origin.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force acting on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = -∫_∞^d F_elec ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image at that moment:\n*   Image charge at `x`: `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   Image position at `x`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Force `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done by the field:\n`W_field = ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`W_field = -k * q^2 * R * ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (-k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_∞^d`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞] = k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\nThe potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = -k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_induced_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0. So the second term is zero.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n\n`V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\nThe distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is:\n`distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (distance) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the potential energy:\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image\" charge. This image charge is positioned such that the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Position**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` is half of the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, and simply calculating the interaction potential `q * V_image` would double-count the energy. The work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge.\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Formula**:\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_image = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The potential energy of the system is:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of images, a powerful technique in electrostatics for problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). Since the sphere is a conductor, the charge `q` will induce an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To find the potential and field outside the sphere, we can replace the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must create a potential of zero on the surface that was once the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (the source of the potential) is itself created by the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Potential from Image Charge:** The potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`. The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n6.  **Substitution and Simplification:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Finally, we calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\nThe following Python code will select and print the correct choice from the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_potential_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct formula for the potential energy of a charge\n    near a grounded conducting sphere and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system with a charge q\n    # at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.\n\n    # Based on the method of images in electrostatics, the potential energy U is derived as:\n    # U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n    # where k is Coulomb's constant.\n\n    # Let's define the given options.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"B\": \"U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\",\n        \"C\": \"U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"D\": \"U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\"\n    }\n\n    # The derived correct formula corresponds to option C.\n    correct_choice_key = \"C\"\n    correct_choice_formula = options[correct_choice_key]\n\n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice_key}\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the net potential energy is: {correct_choice_formula}\")\n\nsolve_potential_energy_problem()\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The correct option is: C\nThe formula for the net potential energy is: U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n    *   The point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We assume `d > R`, meaning the charge is outside the sphere.\n    *   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method: The Method of Images**\n    *   This problem involves a charge and a conductor with a simple geometry (a sphere). Such problems are most easily solved using the **method of images**.\n    *   The method of images states that the electric field and potential *outside* the conducting sphere can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n    *   The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition, which in this case is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The image charge is located along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located *inside* the original sphere's volume. The negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge and the sphere is attractive.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   A more direct way to calculate this energy is to consider the interaction energy. The potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere) is given by:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution on the sphere is itself created by the presence of `q`. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge builds up, and the work done is half of what it would be if the induced charge were a fixed, pre-existing charge distribution.\n    *   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   According to the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n5.  **Calculate `V_induced`**\n    *   The potential at distance `d` from the center due to the image charge `q'` at distance `b` from the center is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `V_induced` into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Check**\n    *   The result is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   The energy is negative, which is correct for an attractive force.\n    *   The units are correct (`k*q^2/distance`).\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\n        B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n        C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n        D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n\nThe final answer is derived from a standard application of the method of images and the formula for potential energy in the presence of an induced charge distribution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced surface charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The real induced charges on the sphere's surface are replaced by this fictitious image charge for the purpose of calculation outside the sphere.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   For the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n    *   Through standard derivation (by ensuring the potential is zero at points on the sphere), the properties of the image charge are found to be:\n        *   Position of image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n        *   Magnitude of image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As the charge `q` is brought closer, the induced charge on the sphere (and thus the image charge) changes.\n\n    A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the final image charge `q'` as `U = k*q*q'/(d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the location of `q`.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of the charge `q` created by all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the induced charges are themselves created by `q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Potential at the location of q:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced surface charge is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        *   `q' = -qR/d`\n        *   `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    *   `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy (U):**\n    *   Now use the correct energy formula: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (has R²)\n    *   B) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has d instead of R)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect (wrong sign in denominator, has d instead of R)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n\nThe derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo solve this problem, we use the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere can be replaced by an \"image\" charge, which, together with the original charge `q`, reproduces the correct potential (zero) on the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the sphere can be replaced by an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`. The values for the image charge and its position are:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n2.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the attractive force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere. This force is equivalent to the force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by its image:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n        The image charge at that point is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n        The work done is the integral of this force from infinity to `d`.\n        `U = W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n        Performing this integration yields:\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n        A more direct method is to use the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of a conductor. The potential energy is half the product of the charge and the potential at its location created by the induced charges. The potential created by the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n        The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        The potential energy is then:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which corresponds to option A.

The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system (the charge `q` plus the sphere with its induced charges).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** This is a classic electrostatics problem that is best solved using the \"method of images.\" The principle is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the image charge be `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n    *   For the potential to be zero at any point on the sphere's surface (a distance `R` from the center), the image charge must be:\n        *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   And its position must be: `b = R^2/d`\n    *   With this image charge `q'` at position `b`, the potential created by `q` and `q'` on the surface of the sphere is indeed zero. Therefore, for any point outside the sphere, the electric field and potential are correctly described by the combination of the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct formula for the energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i * V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    *   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the charge on the sphere.\n    *   The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0` (it's grounded).\n    *   The potential at the location of the charge `q` is the sum of its own potential (which we don't count in the interaction energy) and the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere, let's call this `V_induced`.\n    *   The formula for the total energy simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The term for the sphere is `(1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`, which is zero.\n\n5.  **Finding V_induced:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) is, by the method of images, the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   So, the potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - R^2/d]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation of Energy (U):**\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into our energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system has lower energy than when the charge is at infinity (where U=0).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\nWhen the charge `q` is brought near the sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. These induced charges redistribute themselves in such a way that the net potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. Calculating the potential energy directly from this surface charge distribution (`sigma`) is complicated.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nA powerful technique to solve this type of problem is the \"method of images.\" We can replace the grounded sphere and its complex induced surface charge with a single, imaginary point charge (an \"image charge\") inside the sphere. This setup must replicate the boundary condition, which is V = 0 on the surface of the sphere.\n\nLet's find the magnitude and position of this image charge, which we'll call `q'`.\n\n*   **Position of Image Charge (`b`):** The image charge `q'` must lie on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the external charge `q`. Let its distance from the center be `b`.\n*   **Magnitude of Image Charge (`q'`):** For the potential to be zero everywhere on the sphere's surface (at radius `R`), the image charge and its position are found to be:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\nNow, the system of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` perfectly reproduces the electric field *outside* the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to these two charges is zero, satisfying the boundary condition.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. As we bring `q` closer, it moves in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential created by these induced charges at the location of `q` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe force on the charge `q` is the electrostatic force between `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   The force is `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`.\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the integral of the force.\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\nThis integration is possible but can be complex.\n\n**Method B: Using Potential (Simpler)**\n\nA more direct formula for the interaction energy `U` between a charge `q` and a grounded conductor is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nWhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. As established, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n1.  **Calculate `V_induced` at the position of `q`:**\n    The potential at distance `d` from the center (the location of `q`) due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   distance = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n    Substituting these in:\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Potential Energy `U`:**\n    Now, we use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*(Note: The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution is not independent; its existence and magnitude depend on the presence of `q`. We are calculating the energy to build the entire system, not just placing a charge in a pre-existing field.)*\n\n### 4.

This image charge, along with the original charge *q*, reproduces the zero potential on the surface of the sphere.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Position**:\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `d' = R²/d` from the center of the sphere, on the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d*. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*.

The grounded sphere itself is at zero potential. The image charge is positioned and sized such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Force**: The force on the real charge `q` is the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere's surface. In the image method, this is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The force is:\n    `F = k * q * q' / (d - b)^2`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `b`:\n    `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2`\n    `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the force on the charge `q` when it is at the specific distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy (U) of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is the integral of the force along the path.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Here, `x` is the variable distance from the center. The force as a function of `x` is `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n5.  **Solving the Integral**: We can solve this integral using a u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ (1/2) * du / u^2 = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/(∞^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Alternative Explanation (Factor of 1/2)**: The potential energy of a charge `q` in an external potential `V` is `U = qV`. However, in this case, the potential from the induced charge is not independent of `q`; it is created by `q`. The work done in building up the charge from 0 to `q` at position `d` introduces a factor of 1/2. The potential at `d` due to the image charge is `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`. The total potential energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image system consists of:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the center.\n*   An image charge `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nThe values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (a sphere of radius `R`) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n*   Position of the image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n*   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, then `b < R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As we bring `q` towards the sphere, the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes. This can be handled in two main ways:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe force on the charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere, which in our image model is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n*   Force between `q` and `q'`: `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\n*   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2 = - k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\nThis is the force at the final position `d`. To find the energy, we must integrate the force `F(x)` as the charge moves from infinity to `d`.\n`U = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dx = -∫_∞^d F_electric ⋅ dx`\n`U = -∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R * ∫_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫_∞^{d^2-R^2} u^{-2} du = (k * q^2 * R / 2) [-u^{-1}]_∞^{d^2-R^2}`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) [-1/(d^2-R^2) - (-1/∞)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of assembling a charge distribution: `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a point charge `q` and a grounded conductor, this simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   This potential `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   `V_induced = V_image(at d) = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n*   Distance from `q'` to `q` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy is negative, which is expected as the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere.\n\n**3.

The force on the real charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is due to the image charge `q' = -qR/x` located at `b = R^2/x`. The force is `F(x) = k*q*q' / (x-b)^2`, and the potential energy is the integral of this force from infinity to `d`.\n2.  **Interaction Energy:** Using the formula for the interaction energy between a charge and an induced charge distribution on a conductor, which is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charge (`V_induced`) is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nBoth derivations led to the same result. The Google search results confirm the methodology used, particularly the \"method of images\" for a point charge and a grounded conducting sphere. This method involves placing an image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at `d`.\n\nThe calculated force of attraction between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` is `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`. Integrating this force from infinity to `d` gives the potential energy. This confirms the steps taken in the initial derivation.\n\nThe final derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. Let's compare this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe derived formula exactly matches option C. The presence of the `1/2` factor is crucial and comes from the fact that the induced charge distribution (and thus the image charge) is created by the real charge itself. The potential energy is the work done to assemble the system, and simply multiplying the charge `q` by the potential from the image charge would result in double-counting the energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the net potential energy of the system is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nOf course, I can help you with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the final answer.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V=0`). The presence of `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Use the Method of Images:** This problem is elegantly solved using the method of images. To satisfy the boundary condition (`V=0` on the sphere's surface), we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line joining the center and `q`. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):** Standard derivation shows that for the potential to be zero on the sphere's surface, the image charge and its position must be:\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. A key result from electrostatics states that the energy of a charge `q` near a grounded conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` caused by the induced charges on the conductor. In our image charge model, this is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Formula:**\n    *   First, find the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`:\n        `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Next, calculate `V_induced`, the potential at `q`'s location due to `q'`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / distance = k * (-q * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        Simplifying this gives:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Finally, calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** This derived formula matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols\nk, q, d, R = sympy.symbols('k q d R')\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * d / (d**2 + R**2)\",\n    \"B\": \"U = -k * q**2 * d / (d**2 - R**2)\",\n    \"C\": \"U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * R**2 / (d**2 - R**2)\",\n    \"D\": \"U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * R / (d**2 - R**2)\"\n}\n\n# The derived correct formula for the potential energy\ncorrect_formula = \"-(1/2) * k * q**2 * R / (d**2 - R**2)\"\ncorrect_choice = \"D\"\n\nprint(\"The problem is to find the net potential energy of a system with a charge q at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.\")\nprint(\"\\nUsing the method of images, the potential energy U can be derived.\")\nprint(\"The steps lead to the formula: U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\")\nprint(\"\\nLet's compare this with the given options:\")\nfor choice, formula in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {formula}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe derived formula matches option {correct_choice}.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(f\"The correct choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The problem is to find the net potential energy of a system with a charge q at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential energy U can be derived.\nThe steps lead to the formula: U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * d / (d**2 + R**2)\nB) U = -k * q**2 * d / (d**2 - R**2)\nC) U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * R**2 / (d**2 - R**2)\nD) U = -(1/2) * k * q**2 * R / (d**2 - R**2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option D.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe correct choice is D.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1.

This force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\n*   Force on `q` at position `x`: `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n*   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -q(R/x)` at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n*   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n*   `F(x) = k * q * [-q(R/x)] / [x - R^2/x]^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    (The negative sign indicates an attractive force).\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against this electric force to bring the charge from infinity to `d`.\n`U = W_ext = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_ext ⋅ dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [-F(x)] dx`\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use u-substitution: Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫ 1/u^2 * (du/2) = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫ u^(-2) du`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u] = -(k * q^2 * R) / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate this from the starting point (`x=∞`) to the end point (`x=d`):\n`U = [-(k * q^2 * R) / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-(k * q^2 * R) / (2(∞^2 - R^2))]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) - 0`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of a charge in the presence of grounded conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n*   This `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'` = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n*   `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d] = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Careful Points & Summary:**\n*   **The 1/2 Factor:** The potential energy of the system is half the interaction energy of the charge and its image.

To find the electric field and potential outside the sphere, we can use the method of images. This method replaces the sphere and its induced surface charges with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface that corresponds to the sphere's original location.\n\n2.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located along the same line connecting the center and `q`. Its properties are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   **Position of image charge (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R / d)`.\n\n    The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to the original charge, which is consistent with an attractive force between the charge and the sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy of the System:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work required to assemble it. In this case, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\n    A key concept for energy involving induced charges is that the potential energy of the interaction is *not* simply the potential energy of the two point charges (`q` and `q'`). This is because the image charge `q'` doesn't exist independently; it's a representation of the induced charge distribution which is itself created by `q`.\n\n    The correct formula for the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_ind`\n\n    Where `V_ind` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all the *other* charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises from the fact that the induced charges are not fixed but are established as `q` is brought into position.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential `V_ind` at the location of `q`:**\n    The potential `V_ind` at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges on the sphere is, by the method of images, the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n    *   The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_ind` is therefore:\n        `V_ind = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n        `V_ind = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n        The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n        `V_ind = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    Now we substitute the expression for `V_ind` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_ind`.\n\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    A) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    B) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    D) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Our derived result, `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`, matches option B exactly. The energy is negative, indicating an attractive force between the charge and the grounded sphere.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **System Description:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge is placed at a specific location inside the sphere such that the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The location of the image charge is at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    A common misconception is to calculate the potential energy simply as the interaction energy between the point charge `q` and its image `q'`. The correct potential energy of the system is half of the interaction potential energy between the charge and its image.\n\n    The potential `V_image` created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the point charge `q` (at distance `d`) is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - d')`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    The net potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the real charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the image charge.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    The calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is typically solved using the method of images.\n\n### Method of Images\n\nTo solve this, we can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, when placed at a specific location inside the sphere, will replicate the electric field outside the sphere exactly. For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge is:\n\n*   **Magnitude `q'`**: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Position `b`**: Located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThe sphere itself is grounded, meaning its potential is zero. Therefore, its contribution to the potential energy, which would be `(1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`, is zero.\n\n### Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The field of the induced charge is identical to the field of the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n\n`V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nSo, the potential created by the image charge at the location of the real charge `q` is:\n\n`V_image = k * [ - (R/d) * q ] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]`\n`V_image = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nA common mistake is to assume the potential energy is simply `U = q * V_image`. However, this is incorrect because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) is not a fixed source; it is created by the presence of `q`. The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`. This factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the source of the potential (the induced charge) is itself dependent on the charge being moved.\n\nTherefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis can also be derived by integrating the force on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity. The force on `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image `q' = -qR/x` at `x' = R^2/x`. The integral of this force gives the same result.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n*   C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the net potential energy of a system consisting of a charge *q* placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the method of images is employed.\n\nThe fundamental principle of this method is to replace the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge, which, along with the original charge *q*, replicates the electric field and potential outside the sphere. For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential on its surface is zero.\n\nThe image charge, denoted as *q'*, is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the real charge *q*. The magnitude and position of this image charge are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge (q'):** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of image charge (b) from the center:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to its position at distance *d*. This can be calculated as half of the interaction energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*.\n\nThe interaction energy (*U_interaction*) between two point charges is given by the formula `U = k * (q1 * q2) / r`, where *r* is the distance between the charges. In this case, the distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is `d - b`.\n\nSubstituting the expression for *b*, the distance is:\n`d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, we can calculate the interaction energy between *q* and *q'*:\n`U_interaction = k * (q * q') / (d - b)`\n`U_interaction = k * (q * [-q * (R/d)]) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n`U_interaction = -k * (q^2 * R / d) * (d / (d^2 - R^2))`\n`U_interaction = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe net potential energy (*U*) of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n`U = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** This problem is a classic electrostatic problem that is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" This method states that the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be accurately described by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed at a specific location *inside* the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge, which is consistent with the fact that the sphere will attract the charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` as `U = k * q * q' / (d - d')`. This is incorrect because the image charge is not a real charge, and its magnitude and position depend on the location of the real charge.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is to consider the potential created at the location of the charge `q` by the *induced charges* on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let `V_induced` be the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced surface charge on the sphere. This is equal to the potential at `d` due to the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    The distance between `q'` (at `d'`) and `q` (at `d`) is `d - d'`.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / d / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **The Factor of 1/2:** The total potential energy `U` of the system is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charge (and the potential it creates) is not constant but is built up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is an integral `∫ V dq`, which results in this factor of 1/2. Another way to see it is that the energy is stored in the interaction between the real charge and the induced charges, and for interaction energies, a factor of 1/2 prevents double-counting.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct.**\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\n    *   D) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe potential energy is negative, which is expected because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1.

To find the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, we can replace the sphere and its induced surface charge with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, combined with the original charge `q`, must produce a potential of zero on the spherical surface at radius `R`.\n\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Location:** It is placed at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n    Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `d' < R`, so the image charge is located inside the original sphere's volume.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy `U` of the system is equal to the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential is zero) to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A general formula for the potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    In our system, we have:\n    *   The point charge `q`.\n    *   The induced charge on the sphere, which has a total value equal to the image charge, `Q_induced = q'`.\n\n    So, the energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + Q_induced * V_sphere]`\n\n    Let's break down the terms:\n    *   `V_sphere`: The potential of the sphere is zero because it is grounded. So, `V_sphere = 0`.\n    *   `V_at_q`: This is the potential at the location of the point charge `q` created by the *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    The second term in the energy equation becomes `Q_induced * V_sphere = q' * 0 = 0`.\n    The energy formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\n4.  **Find the Potential at the Location of q:**\n    According to the method of images, the potential outside the sphere due to the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. Therefore, `V_at_q` is simply the potential at distance `d` from the center, created by the image charge `q'` which is at position `d'`.\n\n    The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `(d - d')`.\n\n    So, `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - d')`, where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'` into the formula for `V_at_q`:\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Finally, substitute this back into our simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The net potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, and work is done *by* the electric field when the charge is brought from infinity.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system where a point charge `q` is placed a distance `d` away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`.

This image charge is positioned such that the potential on the surface of the sphere becomes zero, mimicking the effect of the grounded conductor. The image charge `q'` is placed along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the real charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R² / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential created by these induced charges is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) * q * V`, where `V` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to all *other* charges in the system. In this case, `V` is the potential at distance `d` from the center, caused by the induced charge on the sphere (which is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`).\n\n4.  **Potential at the location of q**: The potential `V` at the location of the real charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `V = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n    *   Simplifying this expression gives:\n        `V = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation**: Now we can calculate the total potential energy `U` of the system:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nTo solve this problem, the grounded conducting sphere is conceptually replaced by an \"image charge\" inside the sphere.

Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it moves within the potential created by the charges induced on the sphere's surface. The potential from these induced charges is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of a conductor (like the grounded sphere) is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` caused by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is itself established as `q` is moved into position.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same point. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n`V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n`V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential energy `U`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3.

Understand the System and the Method**\n\nThe system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). A grounded conducting sphere means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a charge distribution on the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe method of images is the standard technique to solve this problem. We replace the grounded sphere and its complex induced charge distribution with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The electric field (and potential) outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n**2. Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` must be placed at a position `b` along the line connecting the center and `q`, such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. The known results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of the image charge (from the center):** `b = R^2/d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system. Both should give the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using the formula U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i**\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. So, the formula becomes:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   `V_sphere`: The potential of the sphere is 0 because it is grounded. So, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q`: This is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere.\n\nUsing the method of images, this potential is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\nThe distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\nSo, `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n`q' = -qR/d`\n\n`V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Calculating the Work Done**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` while the sphere remains grounded.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = ∫_d^∞ F(x) dx`\nHere, `F(x)` is the force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere. This force is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Using the image method, this is simply the Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'(x)`.\n\nAt a general position `x`:\n*   Image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   Image position `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x = (x^2 - R^2)/x`\n\nThe force on `q` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R/x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow we integrate this force to find the potential energy:\n`U = ∫_d^∞ [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = -k * q^2 * R ∫_d^∞ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, use the substitution:\n`u = x^2 - R^2`\n`du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`\nThe limits of integration change from `x = d → u = d^2 - R^2` and `x = ∞ → u = ∞`.\n\n`U = -k * q^2 * R ∫_(d^2-R^2)^∞ (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/u ]` from `d^2-R^2` to `∞`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ lim_(u→∞)(-1/u) - (-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ 0 + 1 / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nThe problem of calculating the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of image charges.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the physics:\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: A charge `q` placed a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` induces charges on the sphere's surface.

Understand the physical setup:**\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded\", which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0).\n*   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. Since `q` is typically assumed to be positive, negative charges will be attracted to the side of the sphere closer to `q`, and positive charges will be repelled to the other side. However, since the sphere is grounded, it's connected to an infinite reservoir of charge (the Earth). The repelled positive charges will flow away to the ground, leaving a net negative induced charge on the sphere.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Method:**\n*   **Method of Images:** This is a powerful technique to solve electrostatic problems involving charges and conductors. The basic idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the conductor's surface with one or more fictitious \"image charges\" placed *inside* the volume originally occupied by the conductor. These image charges, along with the original external charges, must satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem.\n*   **Boundary Condition:** For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential on its surface (at any point a distance `R` from the center) must be zero. V(r=R) = 0.\n*   **Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. In this case, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center, while the sphere is maintained at V=0.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Image Charge and its Location**\n\nWe need to find an image charge `q'` at a position `d'` from the center such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n*   Let the center of the sphere be the origin.\n*   Let the charge `q` be on the z-axis at z = `d`.\n*   Let the image charge `q'` be on the z-axis at z = `d'`. `d'` must be inside the sphere (`d' < R`).\n*   The potential at any point P on the surface of the sphere due to `q` and `q'` must be zero.\n    *   Potential due to `q`: V_q = k * q / (distance from q to P)\n    *   Potential due to `q'`: V_q' = k * q' / (distance from q' to P)\n*   The condition is V_q + V_q' = 0 on the surface r=R.\n*   Through standard derivation (by enforcing this condition for all points on the sphere), we find the following for the image charge and its position:\n    *   **Position of image charge:** `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`, and it is located inside the sphere on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. It is a fictitious charge used for calculation; the real induced charge is distributed on the surface.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on `q` during this process is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The field produced by these induced charges (outside the sphere) is identical to the field produced by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the energy:\n\n**Method A: Using the formula U = (1/2) qV**\nThe interaction energy of a charge `q` with a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n*   The potential created by the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n*   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n*   The location of `q'` is at distance `d'` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d'`.\n*   The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n*   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `d - d' = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   Now, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution itself builds up as `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is not simply `q * V_final_potential` but involves an integral that results in this factor of `1/2`.\n\n**Method B: Integrating the Force**\nThe work done is the integral of the external force required to move the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic force.\n*   The force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is equal to the force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2` where the charge is at a variable position `x`.\n    `x' = R^2/x` and `q' = -qR/x`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` (This is an attractive force).\n*   The potential energy `U(d)` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`.\n    `U(d) = W = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_external · dx = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_electrostatic · dx`\n    `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n*   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`.\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * ∫ [ (1/2) du / u^2 ] = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]`\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞ ]`\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nOur calculated potential energy is: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)  -> Incorrect.\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) -> Incorrect, has R^2.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) -> **Correct.**\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)          -> Incorrect, missing the 1/2 factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is correctly calculated using the method of images, resulting in the interaction energy between the charge `q` and the potential created by its image charge `q'`, with an additional factor of 1/2. The final expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at V = 0. The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charge on the surface of the conductor to maintain the V=0 condition. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most elegantly solved using the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced surface charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition of the problem, which is that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located along the same line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge, `q'`, is given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    These values are chosen precisely so that the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the sphere's surface (`r=R`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. This can be calculated in a few ways.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n        The force on `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'_{image} / (distance)^2`\n        Here, `q'_{image}(x) = -qR/x` and the distance is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n        `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against this force, bringing the charge from infinity to `d`:\n        `U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n        `U = ∫[d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n        The integral evaluates to:\n        `U = -k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `d` to `∞`.\n        `U = -k * q^2 * R * (0 - (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))))`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n        A simpler method is to calculate the interaction energy of the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The potential energy of the actual system (charge `q` + grounded sphere) is **one-half** of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because the field created by the induced charges exists only outside the sphere, not inside.\n        \n        The interaction energy between `q` and `q'` is:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n        Distance between them = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n        `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `U_interaction = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n        The potential energy of the physical system is half of this:\n        `U_system = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n        `U_system = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2)` - Incorrect (has `R^2`).\n    C) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2)` - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has `d` instead of `R`).\n    D) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)` - **Correct.**\n\nThe final derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. A charge *q* is placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* (where *d* > *R*).\n\nThe presence of the charge *q* induces an opposite charge on the surface of the conducting sphere. To find the potential and forces, we can replace the sphere with an \"image\" charge, *q'*, located inside the sphere.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Determine the image charge (q') and its location (b):**\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge *q'* is given by:\n    q' = - (R/d) * q\n\n    This image charge is located at a distance *b* from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge *q*:\n    b = R² / d\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to the distance *d* from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the electric field created by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the field of the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The potential at the location of charge *q* due to the image charge *q'* is:\n    V' = k * q' / (d - b)\n    where *k* is Coulomb's constant (1 / 4πε₀), and (d - b) is the distance between the real charge and the image charge.\n\n    Substituting the expressions for *q'* and *b*:\n    d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²) / d\n    V' = k * [-(R/d) * q] / [(d² - R²) / d]\n    V' = - k * R * q / (d² - R²)\n\n    The potential energy *U* of a charge *q* in a potential *V'* is given by U = (1/2)qV'. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge and its field are created as the real charge is brought in, so the work done is integrated from zero field to the final field.\n\n    Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n    U = (1/2) * q * V'\n    U = (1/2) * q * [-k * R * q / (d² - R²)]\n    U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nBy comparing this result with the given options, we can see that it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe theoretical derivation I performed resulted in `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** A point charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (`d > R`). The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at V=0.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To solve this problem, we can use the method of images. The effect of the induced charge on the grounded sphere can be replaced by an \"image charge,\" `q'`, located inside the sphere. This replacement is valid for calculating the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n    *   The image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    An important point, often a source of confusion, is whether the potential energy is simply the interaction energy of the charge `q` and the image `q'`. It is not. A common formula for the energy of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n    In our system (the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere), the sphere has a potential of `V_sphere = 0`. So, the only contribution to the energy formula comes from the point charge `q`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n4.  **Potential at `q`:** The potential at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Now, substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` perfectly matches option D. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises from considering that the potential energy is the work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity, not the simple interaction energy of `q` and `q'`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThis problem is a classic example of the method of images in electrostatics. We want to find the total potential energy of the system composed of a point charge *q* and a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Method of Images Setup**: The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the induced charges on the grounded sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge *q* and the image charge `q'` must make the potential on the sphere's surface (at radius R) equal to zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the image charge `q'` and its distance *b* from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    This placement ensures that the potential V = k*q/r₁ + k*q'/r₂ is zero for any point on the surface of the sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    A more direct method to calculate this energy is to use the formula for the energy of a charge distribution: `U = (1/2) * ∫ ρV dτ`. For a system consisting of a point charge and a conductor, this simplifies. The potential energy of the interaction is half the product of the point charge and the potential created at its location by the induced charges.\n\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at the location of charge *q* (a distance *d* from the center) is the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Induced Potential**: The distance between the real charge *q* (at *d*) and the image charge `q'` (at *b*) is `d - b`.\n    The potential at *d* due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * (Rq/d) / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * Rq / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation**: Now substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * Rq / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, so the potential energy decreases as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Problem Setup and Method of Image Charges**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThis problem can be simplified using the method of image charges. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`, with the sphere itself removed.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`) are chosen to make the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) equal to zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere, between the center and the surface, since `d > R` implies `b < R`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\nA general formula for the electrostatic potential energy (`U`) of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, this sum includes the point charge `q` and the continuous distribution of induced charge on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * ∫ V_sphere * σ_induced * dA`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere, which is zero because it is grounded. Therefore, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to all *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere. Let's call this `V_induced`.\n\nSo the formula simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n**3. Finding the Potential due to Induced Charges (`V_induced`)**\n\nAccording to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges outside the sphere (`V_induced`) is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nWe need to calculate the potential at the position of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) that is created by the image charge `q'` (at distance `b` from the center). The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n`V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nwhere `k = 1/(4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`q' = -qR/d`\n`b = R^2/d`\n\n`d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n\nThe `d` in the denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Potential Energy (`U`)**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (the induced charge on the side nearer to `q` is of opposite sign).\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Setup**\n\nWe have a system consisting of:\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n*   The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n\nWe need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n### **2. Method of Images**\n\nThis type of problem is best solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field outside the conducting sphere can be accurately modeled by removing the sphere and replacing it with an \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen specifically to make the potential on the would-be surface of the sphere equal to zero, satisfying the grounded condition.\n\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and an external charge `q` at distance `d`, the equivalent image charge (`q'`) and its position (`b`, distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge value:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the external charge `q`.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n#### **Method A: Work Done to Assemble the System**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is equal to the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance (where energy is zero) to its final position at `d`.\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q`:** The force on the charge `q` at any distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charge on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and its image `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n    The electric force is:\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the attractive force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Work done by an external agent:** The external agent must apply a force `F_ext = -F_elec` to move the charge. The potential energy `U` is the integral of this external force from infinity to `d`.\n    `U = ∫[infinity to d] F_ext(x) dx = ∫[infinity to d] (k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\n3.  **Solve the integral:** We can use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, which means `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫[infinity to d] (1 / u^2) du`\n    The antiderivative is `-(1/u)`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_[infinity to d]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / (infinity^2 - R^2))]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### **Method B: Using the `U = (1/2)∑Q_iV_i` Formula**\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2)∑Q_iV_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `Q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n1.  **Identify charges and potentials:**\n    *   Charge 1: The point charge `q`. The potential at its location due to the other charge (the sphere) is `V_at_q`.\n    *   Charge 2: The total induced charge on the sphere, `Q_sphere`. The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere`.\n    *   The formula becomes: `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\n2.  **Use the grounded condition:** Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. The formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\n3.  **Find `V_at_q`:** The potential `V_at_q` is the potential at position `d` created by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same position.\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   Distance from `q'` to `q`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Potential due to `q'` at location `d`:\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final energy:** Substitute `V_at_q` back into the simplified energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur result matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of images, a technique used in electrostatics to simplify problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images Setup\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere being \"grounded\" means its electric potential is held at zero (`V=0`).\n\nThe electric field outside the sphere, which is created by the original charge `q` and the charges induced on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a simpler system. This system consists of the original charge `q` and a single fictitious \"image charge\" `q'`, placed at a specific point `b` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero everywhere on the sphere's surface (`r=R`).\n\nFor this standard configuration, the image charge has the following properties:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to `q`).\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a charge `q` interacting with a charge distribution that it has induced is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the electric potential at the location of `q` that is created by the induced charges. The factor of `1/2` is essential because the induced charge is not a separate, fixed source but arises due to the presence of `q`.\n\nUsing the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   First, we find the distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`):\n    `Distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d)`\n    Simplifying this expression, we get:\n    `Distance = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n*   Next, we calculate the potential `V_induced` at position `d` due to the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (Distance)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `Distance`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n*   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancels out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   Finally, we calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Comparing with the Options\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = -kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)`\nD) `U = -(1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur result perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. Since the charge is outside the sphere, we know that `d > R`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Appropriate Method:** This electrostatic problem is best solved using the \"Method of Images\". This method simplifies the problem by replacing the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the real system and the image system.\n\n3.  **Define the Image System:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image system that reproduces the same electric field outside the sphere consists of:\n    *   The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n    *   An image charge `q'` placed inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n    This specific choice of `q'` and `b` ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force acting on the charge `q` at any point is due to the induced charges on the sphere. In our image system, this force is simply the attractive Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method A: Integrating the Force**\n    The work done `W` by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` is the negative of the work done by the electric field. This work is stored as potential energy `U`.\n    `U = W = ∫_∞^d F_external ⋅ dr = - ∫_∞^d F_electric ⋅ dr`\n    The electric force on charge `q` when it is at a variable position `x` from the center is the force from its image:\n    *   Image charge at this position `x`: `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n    *   Image position: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n    *   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`\n    *   Force: `F_electric(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The potential energy is the integral of this force from `d` to `∞`:\n    `U = ∫_d^∞ F_electric(x) dx = ∫_d^∞ [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    This integral evaluates to:\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `d` to `∞`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [0 - 1 / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    **Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula `U = (1/2)qV`**\n    A more direct method is to calculate the energy as half the product of the charge and the potential it experiences due to all other charges.\n    *   The total energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`.\n    *   The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere` is 0. The second term vanishes.\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   The potential at `q` due to `q'` is: `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q^2 * R / (d(d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   Now, substitute this into the energy formula:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)`\n    B) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 - R^2)`\n    C) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2)`\n    D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Our result matches option B perfectly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a nearby grounded conducting sphere. This can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image\" charge, `q'`. This image charge is placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`. The values for the image charge and its position are:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -(R/d)q`\n    *   Image position: `b = R²/d`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` at any point during this process is due to the attraction from the induced charges on the sphere's surface. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**: The work `W` done *by the field* to bring the charge from infinity to distance `d` is `W = ∫ F⋅dr`. The potential energy `U` is `U = -W`. The force `F(x)` between the real charge `q` and its image `q'(x) = - (R/x)q` at a separation `x - b(x) = x - R²/x` is complex to integrate directly because the image charge's magnitude and position change as `q` moves.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge**: A more direct method is to calculate the interaction energy of the final configuration. The potential energy of the charge `q` in the presence of the grounded sphere is equal to *half* the interaction potential between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) does not exist independently; its energy is already accounted for in the field of the primary charge `q`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential `V_image` at distance `d` from the center, created by `q'` at position `b`, is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-(R/d)q) / (d - R²/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the energy equation:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-(R/d)q) / ((d² - R²)/d)]`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-Rq/d) * (d/(d² - R²))]`\n\n    Cancel the `d` terms:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-Rq) / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo solve this problem, we use the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **The Setup**: We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`.

    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is best solved using the **method of images**. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" meaning its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V = 0`).\n    *   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the sphere's center (`d > R`).\n    *   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration. The presence of `q` induces charges on the sphere's surface, leading to an attractive force and a change in the system's potential energy.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be modeled by replacing the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed *inside* the sphere. The image charge and its position are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and Its Location:**\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Image charge location:** `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge is located along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The negative sign indicates that the force between the real charge and the sphere is attractive.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common pitfall is to simply calculate the potential energy between the two charges `q` and `q'`. The correct method accounts for the fact that the induced charge (represented by the image) is not an independent entity.\n\n    The potential energy of the interaction is given by the formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the energy is stored in the field, and the work done to bring the charge `q` in from infinity involves building up the induced charge simultaneously.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Formula:**\n    *   In the image method, `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n    *   First, we find the distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`):\n        `distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   Next, we calculate `V_induced` using the image charge:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / distance = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator's denominator and the denominator's denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Finally, we calculate the total potential energy `U` using the formula from Step 4:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's compare our derived formula `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` with the given options:\n    *   **A) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`**: This is a perfect match.\n    *   **B) `U = -kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`**: Incorrect.

Numerator and denominator sign are wrong.\n    *   **D) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`**: Incorrect.

The Method of Images**\n\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. For the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`), the image charge `q'` must be:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nSo, we have a simplified system of two point charges:\n*   The real charge `q` at distance `d` from the origin.\n*   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` at distance `b = R^2/d` from the origin.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force acting on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to assemble the system, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = -∫_∞^d F_elec ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image at that moment:\n*   Image charge at `x`: `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n*   Image position at `x`: `b(x) = R^2/x`\n*   Force `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done by the field:\n`W_field = ∫_∞^d F_elec(x) dx = ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nLet `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`W_field = -k * q^2 * R * ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (-k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_∞^d`\n`W_field = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [1 / (d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞] = k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\nThe potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = -k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) ∑ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\nIn our system, we have the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [q * V_induced_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\nSince the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0. So the second term is zero.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n\n`V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` (distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere. This is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\nThe distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is:\n`distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (distance) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the potential energy:\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image\" charge. This image charge is positioned such that the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Position**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` is half of the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, and simply calculating the interaction potential `q * V_image` would double-count the energy. The work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge.\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Formula**:\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_image = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The potential energy of the system is:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of images, a powerful technique in electrostatics for problems involving charges and conductors.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). Since the sphere is a conductor, the charge `q` will induce an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To find the potential and field outside the sphere, we can replace the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must create a potential of zero on the surface that was once the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position:** For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (the source of the potential) is itself created by the presence of `q`.\n\n5.  **Potential from Image Charge:** The potential `V_induced` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`. The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n6.  **Substitution and Simplification:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Finally, we calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\nThe following Python code will select and print the correct choice from the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_potential_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct formula for the potential energy of a charge\n    near a grounded conducting sphere and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system with a charge q\n    # at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R.\n\n    # Based on the method of images in electrostatics, the potential energy U is derived as:\n    # U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n    # where k is Coulomb's constant.\n\n    # Let's define the given options.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"B\": \"U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\",\n        \"C\": \"U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\",\n        \"D\": \"U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\"\n    }\n\n    # The derived correct formula corresponds to option C.\n    correct_choice_key = \"C\"\n    correct_choice_formula = options[correct_choice_key]\n\n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice_key}\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the net potential energy is: {correct_choice_formula}\")\n\nsolve_potential_energy_problem()\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The correct option is: C\nThe formula for the net potential energy is: U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q`.\n    *   We have a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n    *   The point charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere. We assume `d > R`, meaning the charge is outside the sphere.\n    *   We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method: The Method of Images**\n    *   This problem involves a charge and a conductor with a simple geometry (a sphere). Such problems are most easily solved using the **method of images**.\n    *   The method of images states that the electric field and potential *outside* the conducting sphere can be perfectly replicated by removing the sphere and placing a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` at a specific location `b` inside the sphere.\n    *   The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition, which in this case is that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The image charge is located along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. Since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`, so the image charge is correctly located *inside* the original sphere's volume. The negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge and the sphere is attractive.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy**\n    *   The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n    *   A more direct way to calculate this energy is to consider the interaction energy. The potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere) is given by:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution on the sphere is itself created by the presence of `q`. As `q` is brought from infinity, the induced charge builds up, and the work done is half of what it would be if the induced charge were a fixed, pre-existing charge distribution.\n    *   `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    *   According to the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n5.  **Calculate `V_induced`**\n    *   The potential at distance `d` from the center due to the image charge `q'` at distance `b` from the center is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`**\n    *   Now substitute the expression for `V_induced` into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Check**\n    *   The result is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   The energy is negative, which is correct for an attractive force.\n    *   The units are correct (`k*q^2/distance`).\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect\n        B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n        C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct**\n        D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect\n\nThe final answer is derived from a standard application of the method of images and the formula for potential energy in the presence of an induced charge distribution.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem can be simplified using the method of images.

This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the location of `q`.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final position of the charge `q` created by all other charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).

Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\nWhen the charge `q` is brought near the sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor.

The grounded sphere itself is at zero potential. The image charge is positioned and sized such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Force**: The force on the real charge `q` is the electrostatic force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere's surface. In the image method, this is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    The force is:\n    `F = k * q * q' / (d - b)^2`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `b`:\n    `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2`\n    `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the force on the charge `q` when it is at the specific distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy**: The potential energy (U) of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the sphere's center. This work is the integral of the force along the path.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    Here, `x` is the variable distance from the center. The force as a function of `x` is `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n5.  **Solving the Integral**: We can solve this integral using a u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `∫ (1/2) * du / u^2 = -1 / (2u)`\n    Substituting back `u = x^2 - R^2`:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/(∞^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Alternative Explanation (Factor of 1/2)**: The potential energy of a charge `q` in an external potential `V` is `U = qV`. However, in this case, the potential from the induced charge is not independent of `q`; it is created by `q`. The work done in building up the charge from 0 to `q` at position `d` introduces a factor of 1/2. The potential at `d` due to the image charge is `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`. The total potential energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The grounded sphere itself is removed in this model.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image system consists of:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the center.\n*   An image charge `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`.\n\nThe values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (a sphere of radius `R`) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n*   Position of the image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n*   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, then `b < R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As we bring `q` towards the sphere, the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes. This can be handled in two main ways:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe force on the charge `q` is due to the attraction from the sphere, which in our image model is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n*   Force between `q` and `q'`: `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2`\n*   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   `F = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R / d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)^2 = - k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\nThis is the force at the final position `d`. To find the energy, we must integrate the force `F(x)` as the charge moves from infinity to `d`.\n`U = ∫_∞^d F_ext ⋅ dx = -∫_∞^d F_electric ⋅ dx`\n`U = -∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R * ∫_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) ∫_∞^{d^2-R^2} u^{-2} du = (k * q^2 * R / 2) [-u^{-1}]_∞^{d^2-R^2}`\n`U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) [-1/(d^2-R^2) - (-1/∞)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method B: Using the Potential Energy Formula**\n\nA more direct method uses the formula for the energy of assembling a charge distribution: `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`. For a point charge `q` and a grounded conductor, this simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   This potential `V_induced` is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   `V_induced = V_image(at d) = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n*   Distance from `q'` to `q` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

The force on the real charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is due to the image charge `q' = -qR/x` located at `b = R^2/x`. The force is `F(x) = k*q*q' / (x-b)^2`, and the potential energy is the integral of this force from infinity to `d`.\n2.  **Interaction Energy:** Using the formula for the interaction energy between a charge and an induced charge distribution on a conductor, which is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charge (`V_induced`) is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nBoth derivations led to the same result. The Google search results confirm the methodology used, particularly the \"method of images\" for a point charge and a grounded conducting sphere. This method involves placing an image charge `q' = -q(R/d)` at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at `d`.\n\nThe calculated force of attraction between the real charge `q` and its image `q'` is `F = -k * q^2 * R * d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`. Integrating this force from infinity to `d` gives the potential energy. This confirms the steps taken in the initial derivation.\n\nThe final derived formula is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.

The presence of the `1/2` factor is crucial and comes from the fact that the induced charge distribution (and thus the image charge) is created by the real charge itself. The potential energy is the work done to assemble the system, and simply multiplying the charge `q` by the potential from the image charge would result in double-counting the energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the net potential energy of the system is given by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nOf course, I can help you with that.

The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V=0`). The presence of `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Use the Method of Images:** This problem is elegantly solved using the method of images. To satisfy the boundary condition (`V=0` on the sphere's surface), we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` located at a distance `b` from the center, along the line joining the center and `q`. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):** Standard derivation shows that for the potential to be zero on the sphere's surface, the image charge and its position must be:\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`.

The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The charge `q` induces a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the electric field and potential outside the sphere, we can use the method of images. This method replaces the sphere and its induced surface charges with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface that corresponds to the sphere's original location.\n\n2.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located along the same line connecting the center and `q`. Its properties are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   **Position of image charge (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R / d)`.\n\n    The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to the original charge, which is consistent with an attractive force between the charge and the sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy of the System:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work required to assemble it. In this case, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\n    A key concept for energy involving induced charges is that the potential energy of the interaction is *not* simply the potential energy of the two point charges (`q` and `q'`). This is because the image charge `q'` doesn't exist independently; it's a representation of the induced charge distribution which is itself created by `q`.\n\n    The correct formula for the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_ind`\n\n    Where `V_ind` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all the *other* charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises from the fact that the induced charges are not fixed but are established as `q` is brought into position.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential `V_ind` at the location of `q`:**\n    The potential `V_ind` at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges on the sphere is, by the method of images, the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n    *   The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_ind` is therefore:\n        `V_ind = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n        `V_ind = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n        The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n        `V_ind = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    Now we substitute the expression for `V_ind` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_ind`.\n\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    A) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    B) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    D) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Our derived result, `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`, matches option B exactly. The energy is negative, indicating an attractive force between the charge and the grounded sphere.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **System Description:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge is placed at a specific location inside the sphere such that the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The location of the image charge is at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    A common misconception is to calculate the potential energy simply as the interaction energy between the point charge `q` and its image `q'`. The correct potential energy of the system is half of the interaction potential energy between the charge and its image.\n\n    The potential `V_image` created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the point charge `q` (at distance `d`) is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - d')`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    The net potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the real charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the image charge.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    The calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is typically solved using the method of images.\n\n### Method of Images\n\nTo solve this, we can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, when placed at a specific location inside the sphere, will replicate the electric field outside the sphere exactly. For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge is:\n\n*   **Magnitude `q'`**: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Position `b`**: Located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThe sphere itself is grounded, meaning its potential is zero. Therefore, its contribution to the potential energy, which would be `(1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`, is zero.\n\n### Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The field of the induced charge is identical to the field of the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n\n`V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nSo, the potential created by the image charge at the location of the real charge `q` is:\n\n`V_image = k * [ - (R/d) * q ] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]`\n`V_image = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nA common mistake is to assume the potential energy is simply `U = q * V_image`. However, this is incorrect because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) is not a fixed source; it is created by the presence of `q`. The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`. This factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the source of the potential (the induced charge) is itself dependent on the charge being moved.\n\nTherefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis can also be derived by integrating the force on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity. The force on `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image `q' = -qR/x` at `x' = R^2/x`. The integral of this force gives the same result.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n*   C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the net potential energy of a system consisting of a charge *q* placed at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the method of images is employed.\n\nThe fundamental principle of this method is to replace the conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge, which, along with the original charge *q*, replicates the electric field and potential outside the sphere. For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential on its surface is zero.\n\nThe image charge, denoted as *q'*, is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the real charge *q*. The magnitude and position of this image charge are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge (q'):** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of image charge (b) from the center:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from an infinite distance to its position at distance *d*. This can be calculated as half of the interaction energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*.\n\nThe interaction energy (*U_interaction*) between two point charges is given by the formula `U = k * (q1 * q2) / r`, where *r* is the distance between the charges. In this case, the distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is `d - b`.\n\nSubstituting the expression for *b*, the distance is:\n`d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nNow, we can calculate the interaction energy between *q* and *q'*:\n`U_interaction = k * (q * q') / (d - b)`\n`U_interaction = k * (q * [-q * (R/d)]) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n`U_interaction = -k * (q^2 * R / d) * (d / (d^2 - R^2))`\n`U_interaction = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe net potential energy (*U*) of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n`U = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** This problem is a classic electrostatic problem that is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" This method states that the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be accurately described by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed at a specific location *inside* the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge, which is consistent with the fact that the sphere will attract the charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` as `U = k * q * q' / (d - d')`. This is incorrect because the image charge is not a real charge, and its magnitude and position depend on the location of the real charge.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is to consider the potential created at the location of the charge `q` by the *induced charges* on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let `V_induced` be the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced surface charge on the sphere. This is equal to the potential at `d` due to the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    The distance between `q'` (at `d'`) and `q` (at `d`) is `d - d'`.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / d / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **The Factor of 1/2:** The total potential energy `U` of the system is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charge (and the potential it creates) is not constant but is built up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is an integral `∫ V dq`, which results in this factor of 1/2. Another way to see it is that the energy is stored in the interaction between the real charge and the induced charges, and for interaction energies, a factor of 1/2 prevents double-counting.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct.**\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\n    *   D) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe potential energy is negative, which is expected because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1.

Calculate the Potential Energy\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.\n\n**Method 1: Calculating the work done**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is equal to the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d`. The work is done against the electrostatic force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n*   The force on charge `q` at a variable distance `x` from the center is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q' = -qR/x` at a position `b = R^2/x`.\n*   The force is `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`.\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n*   `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`. This is the attractive force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n*   The work done `W` (which equals the potential energy `U`) is the integral of the external force (`-F_elec`) needed to move the charge from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = W = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F_elec(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [ (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2 ] dx`\n*   To solve the integral, we use a u-substitution: Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫(from ∞ to d) (1/u^2) du`\n*   The integral of `1/u^2` is `-1/u`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n*   `U = [ -k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ] - [ lim(x->∞) -k * q^2 * R / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]`\n*   The second term goes to zero as `x` goes to infinity.\n*   `U = - k * q^2 * R / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n**Method 2: Using the general formula for electrostatic energy**\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n*   In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere.\n*   `U = (1/2) * [ q * V_induced + ∫_sphere σ * V_sphere dS ]`\n*   Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0.

The Method of Images\n\nThe core idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the grounded conducting sphere with a simple \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it's grounded).\n\nLet the sphere have radius `R` and be centered at the origin. Let the real charge `q` be placed on the z-axis at a distance `d` from the center (position z = d).\n\nFor the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius R), the image charge `q'` must be:\n*   Placed at a position `b` along the z-axis.\n*   The magnitude of the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are found to be:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\nNote that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), the position `b` is inside the sphere (`b < R`), and the image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The correct formula for the potential energy `U` in this configuration is half the product of the real charge and the potential created by the induced charges (or equivalently, the image charge) at the location of the real charge.\n\nThe formula is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n\nWhere `V_image` is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\nLet's calculate `V_image`:\n*   The real charge `q` is at `z = d`.\n*   The image charge `q'` is at `z = b = R^2 / d`.\n*   The distance between the real charge and the image charge is `distance = d - b`.\n*   `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nThe potential `V_image` at the location `d` due to the charge `q'` at position `b` is:\n`V_image = k * q' / (distance)`\nwhere `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `distance`:\n`V_image = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_image = - k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can find the total potential energy `U` of the system:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, which is expected.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Image Charges:**\n    This problem is a classic application of the method of image charges. To find the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, we can replace the sphere and its induced surface charge with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, combined with the original charge `q`, must produce a potential of zero on the spherical surface at radius `R`.\n\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   **Location:** It is placed at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n    Since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), it follows that `d' < R`, so the image charge is located inside the original sphere's volume.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy `U` of the system is equal to the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential is zero) to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A general formula for the potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n    In our system, we have:\n    *   The point charge `q`.\n    *   The induced charge on the sphere, which has a total value equal to the image charge, `Q_induced = q'`.\n\n    So, the energy is:\n    `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + Q_induced * V_sphere]`\n\n    Let's break down the terms:\n    *   `V_sphere`: The potential of the sphere is zero because it is grounded. So, `V_sphere = 0`.\n    *   `V_at_q`: This is the potential at the location of the point charge `q` created by the *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    The second term in the energy equation becomes `Q_induced * V_sphere = q' * 0 = 0`.\n    The energy formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\n4.  **Find the Potential at the Location of q:**\n    According to the method of images, the potential outside the sphere due to the induced charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. Therefore, `V_at_q` is simply the potential at distance `d` from the center, created by the image charge `q'` which is at position `d'`.\n\n    The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is `(d - d')`.\n\n    So, `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - d')`, where `k = 1/(4πε₀)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'` into the formula for `V_at_q`:\n    *   `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator cancel out:\n    `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Finally, substitute this back into our simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The net potential energy of the system is `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive, and work is done *by* the electric field when the charge is brought from infinity.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe problem asks for the net potential energy of a system where a point charge `q` is placed a distance `d` away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is most readily solved using the method of images.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **The Method of Images**: To solve this problem, we can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image charge\", `q'`. This image charge is positioned such that the potential on the surface of the sphere becomes zero, mimicking the effect of the grounded conductor. The image charge `q'` is placed along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the real charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R² / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential created by these induced charges is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) * q * V`, where `V` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to all *other* charges in the system. In this case, `V` is the potential at distance `d` from the center, caused by the induced charge on the sphere (which is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`).\n\n4.  **Potential at the location of q**: The potential `V` at the location of the real charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `V = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n    *   Simplifying this expression gives:\n        `V = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation**: Now we can calculate the total potential energy `U` of the system:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe problem of calculating the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic electrostatics problem solved using the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nTo solve this problem, the grounded conducting sphere is conceptually replaced by an \"image charge\" inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original point charge `q`, must create a potential of zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius R), mimicking the condition of the grounded sphere.\n\nThe properties of the image charge `q'` are determined as follows:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** The image charge is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center. As the charge `q` is brought closer, it moves within the potential created by the charges induced on the sphere's surface. The potential from these induced charges is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a charge `q` in the presence of a conductor (like the grounded sphere) is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` caused by the induced charges on the sphere. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is itself established as `q` is moved into position.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same point. The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n`V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n`V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the potential energy `U`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3.

Understand the System and the Method**\n\nThe system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). A grounded conducting sphere means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a charge distribution on the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe method of images is the standard technique to solve this problem. We replace the grounded sphere and its complex induced charge distribution with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The electric field (and potential) outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n**2. Find the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` must be placed at a position `b` along the line connecting the center and `q`, such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. The known results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of the image charge (from the center):** `b = R^2/d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is inside the sphere (`b < R` since `d > R`) and has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system. Both should give the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using the formula U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i**\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere. So, the formula becomes:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`\n\n*   `V_sphere`: The potential of the sphere is 0 because it is grounded. So, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q`: This is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charge on the sphere.\n\nUsing the method of images, this potential is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\nThe distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n\nSo, `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n`q' = -qR/d`\n\n`V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Calculating the Work Done**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` while the sphere remains grounded.\n`U = W_ext = -W_field = ∫_d^∞ F(x) dx`\nHere, `F(x)` is the force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere. This force is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled as the field from the original charge `q` plus a fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, located inside the sphere. This image charge is positioned and valued such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, as required for a grounded conductor.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For this configuration, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the final image charge `q'`. The correct method requires accounting for the fact that the induced charge (and therefore the image charge) changes as `q` is brought closer.\n\n    The correct approach is to recognize that the total energy `U` is half the potential energy of the real charge `q` in the field of the induced charges (which is equivalent to the field of the image charge `q'`). This factor of 1/2 arises because the source of the potential (the induced charge) is itself created by the charge being brought in.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) created by the image charge `q'` is `V'`. The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `V' = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   The total potential energy `U` is `(1/2) * q * V'`.\n\n4.  **Derivation**:\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `q' = -q * R/d`\n        `d - b = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n    *   Calculate the potential `V'` at the position of `q`:\n        `V' = k * [-qR/d] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n        `V' = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Calculate the total potential energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option D. The alternative method of integrating the force on the charge `q` from infinity to `d` yields the same result.\n\n    *   `F = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)^2 = -k*q^2*R*d / (d^2 - R^2)^2`\n    *   `U = -W = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n    *   `U = ∫[d, ∞] F(x) dx = ∫[d, ∞] -k*q^2*R*x / (x^2-R^2)^2 dx`\n    *   Solving this integral gives: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis confirms that option D is the correct expression for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct formula for the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Setup**\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` located a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces a separation of charges on the surface of the sphere. We need to find the potential energy of this entire configuration.\n\n**2. Apply the Method of Image Charges**\nThis problem is best solved using the \"method of image charges.\" This technique simplifies the problem by replacing the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the original charge `q` and this new image charge `q'`.\n\nThe properties of the image charge are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. For a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to `q`) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy (`U`) of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinitely far away to its final position at distance `d`. An elegant way to calculate this energy is with the formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nHere, `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` that is created by all other charges in the system, which in this case is the induced charge on the sphere's surface. In our image charge model, this potential is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n**4. Deriving the Final Formula**\nLet's calculate `V_induced`:\n\n*   The potential at distance `r` from a point charge `Q` is `V = k * Q / r`.\n*   The charge creating the potential is the image charge `q'`.\n*   The distance from the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) to the real charge `q` (at `d`) is `d - d'`.\n*   So, `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [d - (R^2 / d)]`\n*   Simplify the denominator: `d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n*   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n*   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nFinally, substitute this `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n*   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5.

Understand the physical setup:**\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded\", which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V = 0).\n*   The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n*   The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. Since `q` is typically assumed to be positive, negative charges will be attracted to the side of the sphere closer to `q`, and positive charges will be repelled to the other side. However, since the sphere is grounded, it's connected to an infinite reservoir of charge (the Earth). The repelled positive charges will flow away to the ground, leaving a net negative induced charge on the sphere.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Method:**\n*   **Method of Images:** This is a powerful technique to solve electrostatic problems involving charges and conductors. The basic idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the conductor's surface with one or more fictitious \"image charges\" placed *inside* the volume originally occupied by the conductor. These image charges, along with the original external charges, must satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem.\n*   **Boundary Condition:** For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential on its surface (at any point a distance `R` from the center) must be zero. V(r=R) = 0.\n*   **Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. In this case, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center, while the sphere is maintained at V=0.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Image Charge and its Location**\n\nWe need to find an image charge `q'` at a position `d'` from the center such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.\n*   Let the center of the sphere be the origin.\n*   Let the charge `q` be on the z-axis at z = `d`.\n*   Let the image charge `q'` be on the z-axis at z = `d'`. `d'` must be inside the sphere (`d' < R`).\n*   The potential at any point P on the surface of the sphere due to `q` and `q'` must be zero.\n    *   Potential due to `q`: V_q = k * q / (distance from q to P)\n    *   Potential due to `q'`: V_q' = k * q' / (distance from q' to P)\n*   The condition is V_q + V_q' = 0 on the surface r=R.\n*   Through standard derivation (by enforcing this condition for all points on the sphere), we find the following for the image charge and its position:\n    *   **Position of image charge:** `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`, and it is located inside the sphere on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. It is a fictitious charge used for calculation; the real induced charge is distributed on the surface.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on `q` during this process is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The field produced by these induced charges (outside the sphere) is identical to the field produced by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the energy:\n\n**Method A: Using the formula U = (1/2) qV**\nThe interaction energy of a charge `q` with a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n*   The potential created by the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n*   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n*   The location of `q'` is at distance `d'` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - d'`.\n*   The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n*   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `d - d' = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n*   Now, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The factor of `1/2` is crucial. It arises because the induced charge distribution itself builds up as `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is not simply `q * V_final_potential` but involves an integral that results in this factor of `1/2`.\n\n**Method B: Integrating the Force**\nThe work done is the integral of the external force required to move the charge from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic force.\n*   The force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is equal to the force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2` where the charge is at a variable position `x`.\n    `x' = R^2/x` and `q' = -qR/x`.\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2` (This is an attractive force).\n*   The potential energy `U(d)` is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to `d`.\n    `U(d) = W = ∫(from ∞ to d) F_external · dx = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_electrostatic · dx`\n    `U(d) = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n*   Using substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`, so `x dx = du/2`.\n    `U(d) = k * q^2 * R * ∫ [ (1/2) du / u^2 ] = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]`\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [1 / (x^2 - R^2)]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [ 1/(d^2 - R^2) - 1/∞ ]`\n    `U(d) = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with the Given Options**\n\nOur calculated potential energy is: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)  -> Incorrect.\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) -> Incorrect, has R^2.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) -> **Correct.**\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)          -> Incorrect, missing the 1/2 factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is correctly calculated using the method of images, resulting in the interaction energy between the charge `q` and the potential created by its image charge `q'`, with an additional factor of 1/2. The final expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at V = 0. The presence of the charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charge on the surface of the conductor to maintain the V=0 condition. We need to find the total potential energy of this entire system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** This problem is most elegantly solved using the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced surface charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition of the problem, which is that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:**\n    *   For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located along the same line connecting the center and `q`.\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center is given by:\n        `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge, `q'`, is given by:\n        `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\n    These values are chosen precisely so that the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the sphere's surface (`r=R`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at `d`, while the sphere remains grounded. This can be calculated in a few ways.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` due to the induced charge on the sphere is identical to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n        The force on `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is:\n        `F(x) = k * q * q'_{image} / (distance)^2`\n        Here, `q'_{image}(x) = -qR/x` and the distance is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n        `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against this force, bringing the charge from infinity to `d`:\n        `U = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx = ∫[d to ∞] F(x) dx`\n        `U = ∫[d to ∞] [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n        The integral evaluates to:\n        `U = -k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` evaluated from `d` to `∞`.\n        `U = -k * q^2 * R * (0 - (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))))`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n        A simpler method is to calculate the interaction energy of the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The potential energy of the actual system (charge `q` + grounded sphere) is **one-half** of the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. The factor of 1/2 arises because the field created by the induced charges exists only outside the sphere, not inside.\n        \n        The interaction energy between `q` and `q'` is:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n        Distance between them = `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n        `U_interaction = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `U_interaction = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n        The potential energy of the physical system is half of this:\n        `U_system = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n        `U_system = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)` - Incorrect.\n    B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2)` - Incorrect (has `R^2`).\n    C) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 - R^2)` - Incorrect (missing 1/2, has `d` instead of `R`).\n    D) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)` - **Correct.**\n\nThe final derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images.

This work is done against the electric field created by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the field of the image charge *q'*.\n\n    The potential at the location of charge *q* due to the image charge *q'* is:\n    V' = k * q' / (d - b)\n    where *k* is Coulomb's constant (1 / 4πε₀), and (d - b) is the distance between the real charge and the image charge.\n\n    Substituting the expressions for *q'* and *b*:\n    d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²) / d\n    V' = k * [-(R/d) * q] / [(d² - R²) / d]\n    V' = - k * R * q / (d² - R²)\n\n    The potential energy *U* of a charge *q* in a potential *V'* is given by U = (1/2)qV'. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge and its field are created as the real charge is brought in, so the work done is integrated from zero field to the final field.\n\n    Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n    U = (1/2) * q * V'\n    U = (1/2) * q * [-k * R * q / (d² - R²)]\n    U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nBy comparing this result with the given options, we can see that it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe theoretical derivation I performed resulted in `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n1.  **Identify the system:** A point charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (`d > R`). The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at V=0.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** To solve this problem, we can use the method of images. The effect of the induced charge on the grounded sphere can be replaced by an \"image charge,\" `q'`, located inside the sphere. This replacement is valid for calculating the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere.\n    *   The image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    An important point, often a source of confusion, is whether the potential energy is simply the interaction energy of the charge `q` and the image `q'`. It is not. A common formula for the energy of a charge distribution is `U = (1/2) * Σ(q_i * V_i)`, where `V_i` is the potential at charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges.\n\n    In our system (the real charge `q` and the grounded sphere), the sphere has a potential of `V_sphere = 0`. So, the only contribution to the energy formula comes from the point charge `q`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    *   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n4.  **Potential at `q`:** The potential at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n        `V_at_q = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Now, substitute this potential back into the energy formula.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` perfectly matches option D. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises from considering that the potential energy is the work done on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity, not the simple interaction energy of `q` and `q'`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThis problem is a classic example of the method of images in electrostatics. We want to find the total potential energy of the system composed of a point charge *q* and a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Method of Images Setup**: The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the induced charges on the grounded sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `b` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge *q* and the image charge `q'` must make the potential on the sphere's surface (at radius R) equal to zero.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge *q* at a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, the image charge `q'` and its distance *b* from the center are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    This placement ensures that the potential V = k*q/r₁ + k*q'/r₂ is zero for any point on the surface of the sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d* from the sphere's center. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    A more direct method to calculate this energy is to use the formula for the energy of a charge distribution: `U = (1/2) * ∫ ρV dτ`. For a system consisting of a point charge and a conductor, this simplifies. The potential energy of the interaction is half the product of the point charge and the potential created at its location by the induced charges.\n\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    The potential `V_induced` at the location of charge *q* (a distance *d* from the center) is the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that location.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Induced Potential**: The distance between the real charge *q* (at *d*) and the image charge `q'` (at *b*) is `d - b`.\n    The potential at *d* due to `q'` is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * (Rq/d) / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * Rq / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation**: Now substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * Rq / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, so the potential energy decreases as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Problem Setup and Method of Image Charges**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere has a potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThis problem can be simplified using the method of image charges. The electric field and potential outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, are identical to the field and potential created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`, with the sphere itself removed.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`) are chosen to make the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) equal to zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere, between the center and the surface, since `d > R` implies `b < R`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\nA general formula for the electrostatic potential energy (`U`) of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, this sum includes the point charge `q` and the continuous distribution of induced charge on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * ∫ V_sphere * σ_induced * dA`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere, which is zero because it is grounded. Therefore, the second term is zero.\n*   `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to all *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere. Let's call this `V_induced`.\n\nSo the formula simplifies to:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n**3. Finding the Potential due to Induced Charges (`V_induced`)**\n\nAccording to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges outside the sphere (`V_induced`) is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\nWe need to calculate the potential at the position of `q` (at distance `d` from the center) that is created by the image charge `q'` (at distance `b` from the center). The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n`V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\nwhere `k = 1/(4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`q' = -qR/d`\n`b = R^2/d`\n\n`d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n\nThe `d` in the denominator cancels out:\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Final Calculation of Potential Energy (`U`)**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (the induced charge on the side nearer to `q` is of opposite sign).\n\n**5. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nOur calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere's a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Setup**\n\nWe have a system consisting of:\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n*   The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (where `d > R`).\n\nWe need to find the total potential energy `U` of this system.\n\n### **2. Method of Images**\n\nThis type of problem is best solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field outside the conducting sphere can be accurately modeled by removing the sphere and replacing it with an \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen specifically to make the potential on the would-be surface of the sphere equal to zero, satisfying the grounded condition.\n\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and an external charge `q` at distance `d`, the equivalent image charge (`q'`) and its position (`b`, distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge value:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the external charge `q`.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of the system.\n\n#### **Method A: Work Done to Assemble the System**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is equal to the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance (where energy is zero) to its final position at `d`.\n\n1.  **Force on the charge `q`:** The force on the charge `q` at any distance `x` from the center is due to the induced charge on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    The distance between the charge `q` (at `x`) and its image `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n    The electric force is:\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * q' / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    This is the attractive force exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Work done by an external agent:** The external agent must apply a force `F_ext = -F_elec` to move the charge. The potential energy `U` is the integral of this external force from infinity to `d`.\n    `U = ∫[infinity to d] F_ext(x) dx = ∫[infinity to d] (k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n\n3.  **Solve the integral:** We can use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, which means `du = 2x dx`.\n    The integral becomes:\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫[infinity to d] (1 / u^2) du`\n    The antiderivative is `-(1/u)`.\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1 / (x^2 - R^2)]_[infinity to d]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - (-1 / (infinity^2 - R^2))]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [(-1 / (d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### **Method B: Using the `U = (1/2)∑Q_iV_i` Formula**\n\nThe total electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2)∑Q_iV_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `Q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n1.  **Identify charges and potentials:**\n    *   Charge 1: The point charge `q`. The potential at its location due to the other charge (the sphere) is `V_at_q`.\n    *   Charge 2: The total induced charge on the sphere, `Q_sphere`. The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere`.\n    *   The formula becomes: `U = (1/2) * [q * V_at_q + Q_sphere * V_sphere]`\n\n2.  **Use the grounded condition:** Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. The formula simplifies to:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`\n\n3.  **Find `V_at_q`:** The potential `V_at_q` is the potential at position `d` created by the induced charges on the sphere. According to the method of images, this is equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same position.\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   Distance from `q'` to `q`: `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Potential due to `q'` at location `d`:\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (distance) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n        `V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final energy:** Substitute `V_at_q` back into the simplified energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### **4.

The Method of Images Setup\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere being \"grounded\" means its electric potential is held at zero (`V=0`).\n\nThe electric field outside the sphere, which is created by the original charge `q` and the charges induced on the sphere's surface, can be perfectly replicated by a simpler system. This system consists of the original charge `q` and a single fictitious \"image charge\" `q'`, placed at a specific point `b` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero everywhere on the sphere's surface (`r=R`).\n\nFor this standard configuration, the image charge has the following properties:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to `q`).\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a charge `q` interacting with a charge distribution that it has induced is given by:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the electric potential at the location of `q` that is created by the induced charges. The factor of `1/2` is essential because the induced charge is not a separate, fixed source but arises due to the presence of `q`.\n\nUsing the method of images, `V_induced` is simply the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\n*   First, we find the distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`):\n    `Distance = d - b = d - (R^2/d)`\n    Simplifying this expression, we get:\n    `Distance = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n*   Next, we calculate the potential `V_induced` at position `d` due to the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (Distance)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `Distance`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n*   The `d` in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancels out:\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   Finally, we calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3.

Since the charge is outside the sphere, we know that `d > R`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Appropriate Method:** This electrostatic problem is best solved using the \"Method of Images\". This method simplifies the problem by replacing the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conductor with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\". The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the real system and the image system.\n\n3.  **Define the Image System:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image system that reproduces the same electric field outside the sphere consists of:\n    *   The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n    *   An image charge `q'` placed inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The position of the image charge is at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n    This specific choice of `q'` and `b` ensures that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`) is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force acting on the charge `q` at any point is due to the induced charges on the sphere. In our image system, this force is simply the attractive Coulomb force between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    **Method A: Integrating the Force**\n    The work done `W` by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` is the negative of the work done by the electric field.

This can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **Method of Image Charges**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image\" charge, `q'`. This image charge is placed at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`. The values for the image charge and its position are:\n    *   Image charge: `q' = -(R/d)q`\n    *   Image position: `b = R²/d`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` at any point during this process is due to the attraction from the induced charges on the sphere's surface. This force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    There are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**: The work `W` done *by the field* to bring the charge from infinity to distance `d` is `W = ∫ F⋅dr`. The potential energy `U` is `U = -W`. The force `F(x)` between the real charge `q` and its image `q'(x) = - (R/x)q` at a separation `x - b(x) = x - R²/x` is complex to integrate directly because the image charge's magnitude and position change as `q` moves.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using the Potential of the Image Charge**: A more direct method is to calculate the interaction energy of the final configuration. The potential energy of the charge `q` in the presence of the grounded sphere is equal to *half* the interaction potential between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) does not exist independently; its energy is already accounted for in the field of the primary charge `q`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential `V_image` at distance `d` from the center, created by `q'` at position `b`, is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-(R/d)q) / (d - R²/d)]`\n\n    Simplify the denominator:\n    `d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n\n    Substitute this back into the energy equation:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-(R/d)q) / ((d² - R²)/d)]`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-Rq/d) * (d/(d² - R²))]`\n\n    Cancel the `d` terms:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [k * (-Rq) / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo solve this problem, we use the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **The Setup**: We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is held at a potential of zero.\n\n2.  **The Method of Images**: The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed at a specific location inside the sphere. This arrangement must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at r = R) is zero.\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is given by:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n    And its position `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`, is:\n    `b = R² / d`\n\n4.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / 4πε₀`).\n\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n\n    So, the potential created by the image charge at the position of the real charge is:\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d] = -k * qR / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Formula**: The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the potential of the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the total energy of the system includes the interaction energy between the charge `q` and the induced surface charge, as well as the self-energy of the induced surface charge itself. A more detailed derivation shows that the total work done is half the interaction energy between the real and image charges.\n\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Options**:\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    Our derived formula matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges.
