    "This is a problem involving the reaction of a strong acid, a strong base, and a weak acid. To find the final pH, we need to determine which species is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely (HCl -> H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol H+\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates completely (Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-). Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 = 0.180 mol OH-\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+) will react with the strong base (OH-).\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess strong base (OH-). The pH is determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
