    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the description and draw the structure:**\n    *   We start with a benzene ring.\n    *   The molecule has a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group, all *meta* to one another. This suggests a 1,3,5 substitution pattern for these three groups.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority for IUPAC naming, so we assign its position as C1. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**.\n    *   The carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at C3 and C5.\n    *   There is a methoxy group (-OCH3) *para* to the carboxylic acid, which places it at C4.\n    *   There is a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group, both *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This places them at C2 and C6.\n    *   Finally, we use the constraints relative to the nitrile (cyano group) to determine the exact arrangement:\n        *   The methoxy group (at C4) is *ortho* to the nitrile. This is true if the nitrile is at C3 or C5.\n        *   The hydroxyl group (alcohol) is also *ortho* to the nitrile.\n            *   **Scenario A:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C2 to be *ortho* to it. This leaves C5 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C6 for the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n            *   **Scenario B:** If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6 to be *ortho* to it. This leaves C3 for the carbaldehyde (-CHO) and C2 for the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\n2.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules:**\n    *   The carbon with the principal functional group (-COOH) is C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the other substituents.\n    *   In both Scenario A and Scenario B, the substituents are on carbons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, the set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of which direction we number (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When the set of locants is the same, we number the ring to give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n3.  **List and Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   -CN: **c**yano\n    *   -N(CH3)2: **d**imethylamino\n    *   -CHO: **f**ormyl\n    *   -OH: **h**ydroxy\n    *   -OCH3: **m**ethoxy\n    The alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Numbering:**\n    *   Let's check our two scenarios against the tie-breaker rule. The first substituent in alphabetical order is **cyano**.\n    *   In **Scenario A**, the cyano group is at **C3**.\n    *   In **Scenario B**, the cyano group is at **C5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, **Scenario A** provides the correct numbering.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    *   The correct structure and numbering (from Scenario A) is:\n        *   C1: -COOH (benzoic acid)\n        *   C2: -OH (2-hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (3-cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (4-methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (5-formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (6-dimethylamino)\n    *   Now, we arrange the substituent names in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants:\n        *   3-cyano\n        *   6-(dimethylamino)\n        *   5-formyl\n        *   2-hydroxy\n        *   4-methoxy\n    *   Combining these alphabetically gives the prefix: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy**\n    *   Adding the parent name, the full IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   This name matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
