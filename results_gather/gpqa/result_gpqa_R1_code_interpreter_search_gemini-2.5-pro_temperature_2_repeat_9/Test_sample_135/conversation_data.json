    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, within a sphere of radius `R`.\n\n2.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    *   The problem states that the vector field `f` falls off radially as `1/r^2`.\n    *   This means its magnitude is `|f| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   It also states that the field has a non-zero component only along the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, the unit vector in the radial direction is denoted by `r̂`.\n    *   Therefore, the vector field `f` can be written as: `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Right Tool:**\n    *   The problem involves a volume integral of a divergence. This is the exact form where the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is most useful.\n    *   The Divergence Theorem states that the outward flux of a vector field through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence over the region enclosed by the surface.\n    *   Mathematically: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    *   Here, `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`, and `S` is its boundary surface (the surface of the sphere).\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    *   We need to evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    *   The surface `S` is the sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   The vector field `f` on the surface of the sphere is `f = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element for a sphere, `dS`, is a vector that points perpendicularly outward from the surface. In this case, it points in the radial direction, so `dS = dS * r̂`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Surface Integral:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `f` and `dS` into the surface integral:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S ( (1/R^2) * r̂ ) ⋅ (dS * r̂)`\n    *   The dot product of the radial unit vector with itself is `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∮_S (1/R^2) dS`\n    *   Since `R` is the constant radius of the sphere, `1/R^2` is also a constant over the entire surface. We can pull it out of the integral:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`\n    *   The integral `∮_S dS` simply represents the total surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere of radius `R` is `4πR^2`.\n    *   Substitute this value back into the equation:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (1/R^2) * (4πR^2)`\n    *   The `R^2` terms cancel out, leaving:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    *   Therefore, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`.\n\n*   **A note on the singularity:** One might be tempted to first calculate the divergence of `f`. The divergence of `f = (1/r^2) * r̂` is zero for all `r > 0`. However, the field is singular (undefined) at the origin (`r = 0`). This singularity contains the entire \"source\" of the divergence. The Divergence Theorem elegantly bypasses the need to deal with this singularity directly by relating the integral over the volume to an integral on its boundary, where the field is well-behaved.\n\nComparing the result `4π` with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
