    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** The Michael donor is the nucleophile, which is formed by deprotonating an active methylene compound. Here, dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic protons on the carbon between the two ester groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes one of these protons to form a stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group) is the electrophilic site that the nucleophile will attack.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate formation):** NaOEt deprotonates dimethyl malonate.\n        `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ Na⁺ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Nucleophilic attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π-electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming an enolate intermediate.\n        `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + p-tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃ → (COOCH₃)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product.\n        `(COOCH₃)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH⁻-COOCH₃ + EtOH → (COOCH₃)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃ + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify and Name Product (A):**\n    *   The structure of the product is `(COOCH₃)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this molecule using IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the main carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups. This can be viewed as a propane chain with three trimethyl ester (tricarboxylate) groups.\n    *   Let's number the propane chain: `(COOCH₃)₂-¹CH-²CH(p-tolyl)-³CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   This gives us a propane backbone.\n    *   There are two methyl ester groups on C1 (`1,1-dicarboxylate`).\n    *   There is one p-tolyl group on C2 (`2-(p-tolyl)`).\n    *   There is one methyl ester group on C3 (`3-carboxylate`).\n    *   Combining these parts gives the name: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Reaction):**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** This reaction involves an enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which is a pre-formed nucleophile derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The β-carbon of the enamine (which was the α-carbon of the original ketone) is the nucleophilic center.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Nucleophilic attack):** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in a positively charged iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone). This removes the piperidine and replaces the C=N⁺ bond with a C=O bond.\n\n3.  **Identify and Name Product (B):**\n    *   The attack occurs from the α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone.\n    *   The acceptor molecule is `CH₃-CH(β)=CH-CN`. The new bond forms at the β-carbon. The group added to the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 (alpha) position with a `-(CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)` group.\n    *   To name this product, we consider the butanenitrile as the principal chain: `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(C3)-CH₃(C4)`.\n    *   The substituent at position C3 is a cyclohexanone ring attached via its C2 position. This substituent is named `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of the product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative product, involving an enol (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`), is less stable and not the major product isolated after acidic hydrolysis.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   We are given the product and the Michael acceptor and need to find the Michael donor (reactant C). This is a retrosynthesis problem.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   A Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophilic donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. The β-carbon of MVK is the `CH₂` group.\n    *   The fragment from MVK that is incorporated into the product is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`. This matches the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product's name.\n    *   This group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant (C):**\n    *   The new C-C bond is between C2 of the dione ring and the former β-carbon of MVK. This means that C2 of the dione must have acted as the nucleophile.\n    *   The protons at C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione are flanked by two carbonyl groups, making them highly acidic (pKa ≈ 11). The base (KOH) easily deprotonates this position to form a stabilized enolate.\n    *   This enolate is the active Michael donor.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n    *   The other option, \"2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione,\" is not a standard reactant and is an ambiguous name (it's likely meant to represent the enol tautomer, 3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, but the diketone is the conventional starting material).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given choices, option B matches all three correctly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
