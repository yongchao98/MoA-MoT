    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, this potential can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in the x, y, and z directions.\n    The Hamiltonian for the system is:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\n    where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalue for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    For the three-dimensional isotropic case, the total energy is the sum of the energies from each dimension:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    The energy formula simplifies to:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n3.  **Identify the Excited States:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $n=0$ ($n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0$).\n        $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next energy level, $n=1$.\n        $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n    So, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same principal quantum number $n$. We need to find the number of ways to write $n$ as the sum of three non-negative integers.\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$. We need to find the number of integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$, with $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$.\n\n    This is a classic combinatorial problem. The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n    For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\n    We can also list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ to verify this:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> 6 states\n    *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) -> 1 state\n    Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n    Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
