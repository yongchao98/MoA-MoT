    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane:** This describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **7-oxa:** This means atom 7 is an oxygen, which makes the three-membered ring an epoxide (oxirane). The epoxide is fused to the cyclohexane ring at carbons C1 and C6 (the bridgehead carbons).\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl:** There are methyl groups on carbons C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S):** This defines the absolute stereochemistry of the chiral centers.\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure from this information. We can represent the cyclohexane ring as being roughly planar for easier visualization of \"up\" (beta) and \"down\" (alpha) substituents.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry at C6 (6S):** The groups at C6 are C1, C5, H, and the epoxide oxygen (O).\n    *   Priorities (CIP rules): O > C1 > C5 > H.\n    *   To get an 'S' configuration, if the H atom (lowest priority) is pointing away (down/alpha), the path from O(1) -> C1(2) -> C5(3) must be counter-clockwise.\n    *   Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is \"up\" (beta). This forces the C-H bond at C6 to be \"down\" (alpha). In this arrangement, looking from the top, O -> C1 -> C5 is counter-clockwise. This gives S. So, our assumption is correct: **the epoxide ring is beta (up)**.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry at C1 (1R):** The groups at C1 are the epoxide oxygen (O), C2, C6, and a methyl group (Me).\n    *   Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me. (C6 is attached to O; C2 is not).\n    *   The epoxide is up (beta). For the configuration to be 'R', with the methyl group (lowest priority) pointing towards the viewer (up/beta), the path from O(1) -> C6(2) -> C2(3) must be counter-clockwise. This gives 'S' and reversing it gives 'R'. Let's check: in a top-down view, O -> C6 -> C2 is counter-clockwise. This fits. So, **the C1-methyl group is beta (up)**.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry at C3 (3R):** The groups are C2, C4, Me, H.\n    *   Priorities: C2 > C4 > Me > H. (Path C3-C2-C1(O,Me) outranks C3-C4(Me)-C5).\n    *   To get 'R', with the H atom (lowest priority) pointing towards the viewer (up/beta), the path C2(1) -> C4(2) -> Me(3) must be counter-clockwise. This gives 'S', and reversing it gives 'R'. Let's check: C2 -> C4 -> Me is counter-clockwise. This fits. So, H is up (beta) and **the C3-methyl group is alpha (down)**.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry at C4 (4R):** The groups are C3, C5, Me, H.\n    *   Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. (Path C4-C5-C6(O) outranks C4-C3(Me)-C2).\n    *   To get 'R', with the H atom (lowest priority) pointing away (down/alpha), the path C5(1) -> C3(2) -> Me(3) must be clockwise. This fits a standard planar representation. So, H is down (alpha) and **the C4-methyl group is beta (up)**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide: up (beta)\n*   C1-Me: up (beta)\n*   C3-Me: down (alpha)\n*   C4-Me: up (beta)\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate or Gilman reagent). The active nucleophile is the methyl anion, `CH₃⁻`.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states the nucleophile attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   The epoxide is at C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached.\n    *   C6 has only a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the attack will occur here.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The C6-O bond is pointing up (beta).\n    *   The nucleophile (`Me⁻`) must attack from the opposite side, which is down (alpha). This is a \"backside attack\".\n    *   The configuration at C6, which was **S**, will invert to **R**.\n\n### 3. Structure of the Product\n\n1.  **Bond Changes:** The `Me⁻` attacks C6, and the C6-O bond breaks. The C1-O bond also breaks during workup (which is assumed), and the oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   An -OH group is formed at C1. Since the C1-O bond was up (beta), the **-OH group is at C1 and is up (beta)**.\n    *   A new methyl group is added to C6. Since the attack was from below, the **new methyl group at C6 is down (alpha)**.\n    *   The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not part of the reaction, so their absolute configurations are retained.\n\n2.  **IUPAC Naming of the Product:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol. The carbon bearing the -OH group is defined as C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n    *   The substituents are methyl groups. We need to find their positions according to the new numbering.\n    *   We number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Path 1: C1(orig) -> C2(orig) -> C3(orig) -> ... Methyls at C1(orig), C3(orig), C4(orig), C6(orig). The new methyl is at C6. Locants: {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Path 2: C1(orig) -> C6(orig) -> C5(orig) -> ... Methyls are at C1(orig), C6(orig), C4(orig), C3(orig). The numbering would be C1(orig1), C2(orig6), C3(orig5), C4(orig4), C5(orig3), C6(orig2). The locants are {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   The set {1,2,4,5} is lower than {1,3,4,6}. So, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   **New C1 (original C1):** Configuration is retained. It was 1R. So, the product is **1R**.\n    *   **New C2 (original C6):** Configuration is inverted. It was 6S. So, the product is **2R**.\n    *   **New C4 (original C4):** Configuration is retained. It was 4R. So, the product is **4R**.\n    *   **New C5 (original C3):** Configuration is retained. It was 3R. So, the product is **5R**.\n\nCombining these, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
