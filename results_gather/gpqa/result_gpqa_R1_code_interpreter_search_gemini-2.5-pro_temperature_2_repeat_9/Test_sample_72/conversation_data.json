    "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\na) The relative speed between them ($v_{rel}$).\nb) The total energy of the system ($E_{total}$).\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   Astronaut 1 (A): Mass $m_A = 2m$, Velocity $v_A = 0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction).\n*   Astronaut 2 (B): Mass $m_B = 3m$, Velocity $v_B = 0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction).\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation:**\n\n*   **For Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):** Since the speeds are relativistic, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for finding the relative velocity. The formula for velocities along the same direction is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **For Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy of a single particle is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n    where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}$\n    The total energy will be $E_{total} = E_A + E_B$.\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation:**\n\n**a) Calculate Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):**\nLet $v_1 = v_A = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = v_B = 0.5c$.\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\nRounding to two decimal places, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n**b) Calculate Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n\nFirst, calculate the energy for each astronaut.\n\n*   **Astronaut A:**\n    *   Rest mass: $m_A = 2m$\n    *   Velocity: $v_A = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_A$):\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy ($E_A$):\n        $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Astronaut B:**\n    *   Rest mass: $m_B = 3m$\n    *   Velocity: $v_B = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_B$):\n        $\\gamma_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy ($E_B$):\n        $E_B = \\gamma_B m_B c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total System Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    $E_{total} = E_A + E_B = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n    $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**5. Final Verification using Python:**\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative Speed Calculation\n# Velocities are given in units of c\nv_a = 0.6\nv_b = 0.5\n# Relativistic velocity subtraction formula\nv_rel = (v_a - v_b) / (1 - v_a * v_b)\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy Calculation\n# The final energy will be in units of mc^2. We calculate the coefficient.\n\n# Astronaut A\nm_a_coeff = 2\nv_a_coeff = 0.6\ngamma_a = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_a_coeff**2)\nenergy_a_coeff = gamma_a * m_a_coeff\n\n# Astronaut B\nm_b_coeff = 3\nv_b_coeff = 0.5\ngamma_b = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_b_coeff**2)\nenergy_b_coeff = gamma_b * m_b_coeff\n\n# Total Energy\ntotal_energy_coeff = energy_a_coeff + energy_b_coeff\n\n# Print the results, formatted to match the options\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {total_energy_coeff:.2f}mc^2\")\n\n```\n```output\nv_rel = 0.14c\nE = 5.96mc^2\n```\nThe computed values are $v_{rel} = 0.14c$ and $E = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately $0.14c$, and the total energy is approximately $5.96mc^2$. These results match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n#### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction, the relative speed is not a simple subtraction. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n#### 2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of its components. The formula for the relativistic energy of a particle is:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nwhere $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   Mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   Mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m)c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 \\approx 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and the total energy is $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
