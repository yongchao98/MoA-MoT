    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The formula is DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBE (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which could be a C=O or C=C bond.\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Signals:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates that the adjacent carbon has two protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). This suggests a -CH2-CHO fragment. The single DBE is accounted for by the C=O of the aldehyde.\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A signal for two protons, appearing as a doublet (d). This means the adjacent carbon has one proton (n+1 rule: 1+1=2). This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as the -CH2- protons are coupled to the single -CHO proton.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons and appearing as doublets, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for an amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    *   A para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4)\n    *   An amine group (-NH2)\n    *   An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH2CHO)\n    Assembling these gives 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4(ring) + C2H3O(side chain) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n    The structure is:\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, Heat**\n    This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** Gently heating the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, with the diazonium group being replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water, releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   **Product of this stage (Intermediate):** The starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n     \n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This set of conditions (a base and heat) is characteristic of an aldol condensation reaction for an aldehyde that has α-hydrogens. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has two acidic α-hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. It will undergo self-condensation.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of the aldehyde forms an enolate ion by losing an α-hydrogen to the base (KOH). This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms an aldol addition product.\n        The initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option D).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). The α-hydrogen (on C2) and the hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a new carbon-carbon double bond. This creates a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Final Product Identification:**\n    Let's draw the final condensation product and name it.\n    The structure formed after dehydration is:\n     \n\n    To name this compound using IUPAC rules:\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (aldehyde) has four carbons. The parent name is **butanal**.\n    2.  There is a double bond between C2 and C3. The parent name becomes **but-2-enal**.\n    3.  There is a **4-hydroxyphenyl** group attached to C2.\n    4.  There is another **4-hydroxyphenyl** group attached to C4.\n    5.  Combining these gives the name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure perfectly match option B. Option D is the intermediate aldol adduct before the dehydration step. Since heat is applied, the reaction proceeds to the more stable condensation product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
