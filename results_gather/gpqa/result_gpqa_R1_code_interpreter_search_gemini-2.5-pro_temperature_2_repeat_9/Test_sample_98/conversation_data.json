    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Data**\n    *   **FTIR:**\n        *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't differentiate between the options.\n\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   \"no signals correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This tells me there are no `C=C` double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n        *   \"One of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a very specific splitting pattern. For a signal (let's say for a proton `HA`) to be a `dtq`, it must be coupled to three distinct neighboring groups of protons:\n            *   One single proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n            *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (n=2, gives a triplet).\n            *   A group of three equivalent protons, like a CH₃ group (n=3, gives a quartet).\n        *   \"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": This is another highly specific pattern. A proton exhibiting this splitting must be coupled to three different groups of neighbors:\n            *   One single proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n            *   A group of two equivalent protons, like a CH₂ group (n=2, gives a triplet).\n            *   *Another* group of two equivalent protons, like a second, different CH₂ group (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structures of the Options**\n\n    The core of the problem is to find which of the four molecules would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum. I'll analyze the expected splitting patterns for the key protons (the ones on the carbon backbone, not the simple terminal ones) for each molecule.\n\n    *   **Option C: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\n        This formula represents 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid: `(CH₃)₂CH–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–COOH`.\n        *   Let's look at the `CH` proton at position 4: `–CH(CH₃)₂`. It is coupled to the `CH` proton at C3 (1H) and two methyl groups (6H). This signal would be a doublet of septets. Not a `dtq` or `dtt`.\n        *   Let's look at the `CH` proton at position 3: `–CH(CH₃)–`. It's coupled to the `CH₂` (2H), the `CH` at C4 (1H), and its own methyl group (3H). This is too complex and involves coupling to diastereotopic CH₂ protons, but it's not a clean `dtt` or `dtq`.\n        *   **Conclusion for C:** Unlikely to produce the specified signals.\n\n    *   **Option D: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\n        This represents 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH(CH₃)–COOH`.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (`–CH(CH₃)–`). Its neighbors are the proton on C2 (1H), its own methyl group (3H), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl group (2H). This proton is coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor group, and a 3H neighbor group. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**! So this molecule has one of the required signals.\n        *   Now, we need to find a `dtt` signal in this molecule. A `dtt` requires a proton coupled to one 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. This molecule only has one `CH₂` group. It's impossible for any proton in this molecule to be coupled to two different `CH₂` groups.\n        *   **Conclusion for D:** It has the `dtq` but lacks the `dtt`. Not the answer.\n\n    *   **Option B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\n        This represents 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂–CH(C₂H₅)–CH(C₂H₅)–COOH`.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton on C3 (`–CH(C₂H₅)–`). Its neighbors are the proton on C2 (1H), the `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2H), and the `CH₂` group at the end of the pentanoic acid chain (2H). This proton is coupled to a 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**! This molecule has the other required signal.\n        *   Now, let's look for a `dtq`. This requires a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Looking at the protons on C2 and C3, and even the protons within the `CH₂` groups, none have this specific set of neighbors. For example, the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (1H) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H), giving a `dt`. The protons in the various `CH₂` groups would give `ddq` patterns (doublet of doublets of quartets).\n        *   **Conclusion for B:** It has the `dtt` but lacks the `dtq`. Not the answer.\n\n    *   **Option A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n        This notation is best interpreted as a chain built from these pieces, resulting in 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃–CH(C₂H₅)–CH(C₂H₅)–CH₂–COOH`.\n        Let's draw out the key protons on the backbone: `CH₃–CH(d)–CH(c)–CH₂(b)–COOH`. Each `CH` has an ethyl group attached.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton `H(c)`. Its neighbors are: the `CH₂(b)` group (2H), the `CH(d)` proton (1H), and the `CH₂` group from its own ethyl substituent (2H). Therefore, `H(c)` is coupled to one 1H neighbor and two different 2H neighbors. Its signal is a **dtt**.\n        *   Let's analyze the proton `H(d)`. Its neighbors are: the `CH(c)` proton (1H), the terminal `CH₃` group (3H), and the `CH₂` group from its own ethyl substituent (2H). Therefore, `H(d)` is coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor, and a 3H neighbor. Its signal is a **dtq**.\n        *   **Conclusion for A:** This molecule contains a proton that gives a `dtt` signal (`H(c)`) and a different proton that gives a `dtq` signal (`H(d)`). This matches the provided data perfectly.\n\n3.  **Final Decision**\n\n    Based on the detailed ¹H NMR splitting analysis, only the structure corresponding to option A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, exhibits both a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n<<<A>>>"
