    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Metric and the Area Element\n\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a Riemannian metric on a 2-dimensional surface, described by Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$. The metric can be written in matrix form $ds^2 = g_{ij}dx^i dx^j$.\nThe components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ are:\n$g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nSo the metric tensor is:\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ on the surface is given by $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$\\det(g_{ij}) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we find the area element:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} \\, dx \\, dy = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right| \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### 2. Determining the Domain of Integration\n\nThe problem asks for the area of the \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\". The metric has a singularity when the denominator is zero, i.e., when $4-x^2-y^2=0$, or $x^2+y^2 = 4$. This is a circle of radius 2 in the $(x,y)$ plane.\nThis suggests that the surface is defined on the open disk $D$ where $x^2+y^2 < 4$. Inside this disk, the term $4-x^2-y^2$ is always positive. Therefore, the absolute value can be removed:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nThe total area $A$ is found by integrating this area element over the disk $D$:\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Area Integral\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it's convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\n\nIn polar coordinates, $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$, and the area element $dx\\,dy$ becomes $\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\nThe domain of integration $D$ (the disk of radius 2) is described by:\n$0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral, we get:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\, \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\nWe can separate the integrals over $\\theta$ and $\\rho$:\n$A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho\\right)$\n\nThe first integral is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Improper Integral\n\nThe second integral, over $\\rho$, is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ becomes infinite as $\\rho$ approaches 2.\nLet $I_\\rho = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$.\nWe use a substitution to evaluate this integral. Let $u = 4-\\rho^2$. Then $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which means $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2}du$.\nWe also change the limits of integration:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n- As $\\rho \\to 2^-$, $u \\to 4 - 2^2 = 0^+$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I_\\rho = \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = -16 \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$\n\nWe can flip the limits of integration, which changes the sign of the integral:\n$I_\\rho = 16 \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$\n\nThe antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{u}$ is $\\ln|u|$. So we have:\n$I_\\rho = 16 \\left[\\ln|u|\\right]_0^4 = 16 \\left(\\ln(4) - \\lim_{u\\to 0^+} \\ln(u)\\right)$\n\nSince $\\lim_{u\\to 0^+} \\ln(u) = -\\infty$, the integral diverges:\n$I_\\rho = 16 \\left(\\ln(4) - (-\\infty)\\right) = +\\infty$\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\n\nThe total area is the product of the two integrals:\n$A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the given surface is infinite.\nThis result is consistent with the properties of other representations of pseudospheres (surfaces of constant negative curvature), which often have infinite surface area.\nLooking at the options:\nA) $+\\infty$\nB) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$\nC) 0\nD) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)\n\nOptions B and D are functions of coordinates, but an area must be a scalar number. Option C is incorrect as the integrand is strictly positive over the domain. Our calculation confirms that the area is infinite.\n\n<<<A>>>"
