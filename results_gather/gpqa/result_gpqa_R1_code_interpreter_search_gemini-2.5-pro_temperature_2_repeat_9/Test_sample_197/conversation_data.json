    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:**\n    In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total cobalt concentration, denoted as `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free cobalt ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\n2.  **Define the stability constants (β):**\n    The overall stability constants (βₙ) describe the formation of each complex from the free metal ion and the ligand:\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)⁺]`  ; `β₁ = [Co(SCN)⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` ; `β₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃⁻]` ; `β₃ = [Co(SCN)₃⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]` ; `β₄ = [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n3.  **Express complex concentrations:**\n    We can rearrange the stability constant equations to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`. This is equivalent to finding its mole fraction (α₂) relative to the total cobalt concentration and multiplying by 100.\n    `Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co) ) * 100%`\n\n    Let's substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 3 into this formula:\n    `α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻])`\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and every term of the denominator, so it can be cancelled out:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    *Note:* The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is much smaller than the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. This means that the amount of SCN⁻ that is used to form complexes is negligible, and we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` as its initial concentration, 0.1 M.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    Now, we plug the given values into the formula for `α₂`:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's use a Python script to compute the result accurately.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the mole fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all cobalt species\n# The term '1' represents the free Co(II) ion\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * (SCN_conc**1) + beta2 * (SCN_conc**2) + beta3 * (SCN_conc**3) + beta4 * (SCN_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>\n16.9\n\nThe calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species is 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemistry equilibrium problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe main goal is to calculate the percentage of one specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, out of the total amount of cobalt in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M\n*   Thiocyanate concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constants:\n    *   `β₁` (for `[Co(SCN)⁺]`) = 9\n    *   `β₂` (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`) = 40\n    *   `β₃` (for `[Co(SCN)₃⁻]`) = 63\n    *   `β₄` (for `[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`) = 16\n\n**3. Formulate the Problem:**\nThe percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` is given by the formula:\n`% [Co(SCN)₂] = ( [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co) ) * 100`\n\nThe total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]`\n\n**4. Use Stability Constants to Relate Concentrations:**\nThe overall stability constants (`βₙ`) are defined as:\n`βₙ = [Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻ⁿ] / ([Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ)`\n\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]` and the ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]¹`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**5. Develop the Calculation Formula:**\nSubstitute these expressions back into the total concentration equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nWe can factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe mole fraction of the desired complex, `α₂`, is:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Important Assumption:**\nThe problem states the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M` and the thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the metal ion concentration (`0.1 M >> 0.01 M`), we can assume that the concentration of the free ligand `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its initial concentration, `0.1 M`. The amount of SCN⁻ used up in forming complexes is negligible. The total cobalt concentration value is actually not needed for calculating the relative percentage, as seen in the final formula for `α₂`.\n\n**7. Execute the Calculation:**\nNow, I will plug the values into the formula for `α₂` and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. A Python script is efficient for this.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\n# Stability constants for Co(II) thiocyanato complexes\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Concentration of the ligand (thiocyanate)\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # in M\n\n# The formula for the mole fraction (alpha_n) of a complex M(L)_n is:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + beta_1*[L]^1 + beta_2*[L]^2 + ... + beta_N*[L]^N)\n# We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.\n\n# Calculate the numerator: beta2 * [SCN-]^2\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which represents the sum of all species relative to free Co(II)\n# The '1' term represents the free Co(II) ion itself.\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * (SCN_conc ** 1) + beta2 * (SCN_conc ** 2) + beta3 * (SCN_conc ** 3) + beta4 * (SCN_conc ** 4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)2]\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the mole fraction to a percentage\npercentage_CoSCN2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_CoSCN2:.1f}\")\n\n```\n>>>\n16.9\n\nThe output from the code is `16.9`. This corresponds to 16.9%. This matches option D.\n\nFinal Answer reasoning:\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` is its mole fraction (`α₂`) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is calculated by dividing the term corresponding to `[Co(SCN)₂]` by the sum of the terms for all cobalt-containing species.\n\nLet L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\nThe terms are:\n*   Free Co²⁺: 1\n*   [Co(SCN)⁺]: β₁L¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   [Co(SCN)₃⁻]: β₃L³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]: β₄L⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of all terms (denominator) is: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nThe term for the desired complex (numerator) is 0.4.\n\nThe mole fraction α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916.\nThe percentage is 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%, which rounds to 16.9%.\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The percentage of a specific complex in a solution is determined by its mole fraction relative to the total concentration of all metal-containing species.

The '1' represents the free Co(II) ion.\n\nWe are asked to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to `n=2`. Therefore, we need to calculate `α₂` and multiply by 100.\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the total cobalt concentration is much smaller, we can assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration).\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term for free Co²⁺ = 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)⁺]: β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃⁻]: β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]: β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe denominator is the sum of all these terms:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the complex we are interested in, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches the output from the code execution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
