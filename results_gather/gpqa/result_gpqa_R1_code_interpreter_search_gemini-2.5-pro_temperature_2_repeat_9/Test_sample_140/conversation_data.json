    "This question involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction under conditions that favor a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to identify all possible products.\n\n**1. Reactants and Conditions:**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring where position 1 is substituted with a bromine atom (a good leaving group) and position 2 is substituted with a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms (H).\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (via Benzyne)**\nThis reaction proceeds through a two-step mechanism: elimination to form a benzyne intermediate, followed by the addition of the nucleophile.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium (D).\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen (H).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Deuteron from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate then expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Crucially, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this pathway. Let's call this **Benzyne-I**. This intermediate has only hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Proton from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion abstracts the proton (H⁺) from C6. (Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the lighter proton is faster than the heavier deuteron, so this pathway is favored, but both occur).\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  This intermediate expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. In this case, the deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring. Let's call this **Benzyne-II**.\n\n**Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzynes)**\nThe nucleophile in this reaction is the amide ion (NH₂⁻). It will attack the sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne-I (No Deuterium):**\n    *   Benzyne-I has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The NH₂⁻ ion can attack either C1 or C2.\n    *   Since the intermediate is symmetric (unsubstituted benzyne), attack at either carbon followed by protonation leads to the same product.\n    *   **Product 1:** Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂)\n\n*   **Products from Benzyne-II (Deuterium at C2):**\n    *   Benzyne-II has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2.\n    *   The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6. These are no longer equivalent positions because of the nearby deuterium.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a molecule with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Product 2:** 2-deuteroaniline (or *ortho*-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of this carbanion by NH₃ yields a molecule with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring starting from the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-NH₂). Thus, C6 becomes the new C1, and the original C2 (with the deuterium) becomes the new C3.\n        *   **Product 3:** 3-deuteroaniline (or *meta*-deuteroaniline).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through two different benzyne intermediates, which in turn lead to three distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
