    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The structure is CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n    *   The catalyst is Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis.\n    *   Since only one type of alkene is present (as a racemic mixture), this will be a self-metathesis reaction. The general form of this reaction is:\n        2 R–CH=CH₂  ⇌  R–CH=CH–R + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n\n2.  **Identify the Possible Couplings:**\n    Since we start with a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-alkenes, three types of coupling reactions can occur:\n    *   (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene  → (R,R)-product\n    *   (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene  → (S,S)-product\n    *   (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene  → (R,S)-product\n\n3.  **Analyze the Products of Each Coupling:**\n    The product structure, excluding ethene, is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n    Structure: CH₃CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH₂CH₃\n    This molecule has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a double bond at C4 that can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry. We need to determine the number of unique stereoisomers formed.\n\n    *   **(R) + (R) coupling:** This produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Due to the new double bond, two diastereomers are possible:\n        1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        2.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n    *   **(S) + (S) coupling:** This produces (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, two diastereomers are formed:\n        3.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, the enantiomer of product 1)\n        4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, the enantiomer of product 2)\n        Since we started with a racemic mixture and an achiral catalyst, any chiral product will be formed along with its enantiomer. So these four products represent two racemic pairs.\n\n    *   **(R) + (S) coupling (cross-coupling):** This produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of its E and Z isomers.\n        5.  **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule possesses a center of inversion (`i`) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This type of compound, which has chiral centers but is achiral overall, is called a **meso compound**. Thus, this is a single, achiral product.\n        6.  **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule possesses a C₂ axis of rotation but lacks any improper axes of rotation (like a mirror plane or center of inversion). A molecule with a C₂ axis is chiral. Therefore, this is a chiral product. Because the reaction mixture is racemic overall, its enantiomer, (Z)-(3S, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, must also be formed in an equal amount. So, this coupling produces a pair of enantiomers.\n           6. (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n           7. (Z)-(3S, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral, the enantiomer of product 6)\n\n4.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    Let's list all the unique chemical compounds (stereoisomers) that are possibly formed:\n    1.  (E)-(3R, 6R)-isomer\n    2.  (E)-(3S, 6S)-isomer\n    3.  (Z)-(3R, 6R)-isomer\n    4.  (Z)-(3S, 6S)-isomer\n    5.  (E)-(3R, 6S)-isomer (meso)\n    6.  (Z)-(3R, 6S)-isomer\n    7.  (Z)-(3S, 6R)-isomer\n\n    This gives a total of **7** possible stereoisomeric products.\n\n5.  **Reconcile with the Options:**\n    The calculated number of possible products (7) is not among the options (A) 4, (B) 8, (C) 6, (D) 2. This suggests that the question might have a specific interpretation.\n    *   Option (B) 8 would be the theoretical maximum number of stereoisomers (2³), but it fails to account for the meso compound, so it's incorrect.\n    *   Option (A) 4 could be reached under certain assumptions (e.g., only homo-dimers are formed, or counting achiral fractions), but these are chemically questionable assumptions.\n    *   Let's consider Option (C) 6. A common type of trick in stereochemistry questions is to ask for the number of *chiral* products. Let's count them from our list of 7 total products.\n        *   The (E,R,S)-isomer is meso and therefore **achiral**.\n        *   The other 6 isomers all exist as members of enantiomeric pairs and are therefore **chiral**.\n        \n    If the question is implicitly asking for the number of *chiral* products, the answer would be 6. Given the discrepancy between the full chemical analysis (7 products) and the provided options, this interpretation is the most plausible way to arrive at one of the given answers. It requires a complete stereochemical analysis, including the identification of the often-tricky meso compound.\n\nFinal count of chiral products = Total products - Achiral (meso) products = 7 - 1 = 6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
