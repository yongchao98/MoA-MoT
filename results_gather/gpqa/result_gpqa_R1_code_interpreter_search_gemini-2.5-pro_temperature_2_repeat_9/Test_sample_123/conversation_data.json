    "This is a problem that involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### **1. Reasoning and Derivation**\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Formula**: The number of particles, N, remaining from an initial sample, N₀, after a time, t, is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_eff)\n    where τ_eff is the effective mean lifetime of the particles.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame (τ_lab) is dilated compared to their lifetime in their own rest frame (their proper lifetime, τ_p). This relationship is given by:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ_p\n    Here, γ is the Lorentz factor. This dilated lifetime is the effective lifetime we must use: τ_eff = τ_lab.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel a distance R (the detector radius) in the lab frame. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed, v, is very close to the speed of light, c. We can approximate v ≈ c. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    t = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas**: We can substitute the expressions for `t` and `τ_eff` into the decay equation:\n    N / N₀ = exp( -(R/c) / (γ * τ_p) )\n\n    The term `c * τ_p` is the mean distance a particle would travel in its own rest frame's lifetime, which is the proper decay length, λ_p.\n    N / N₀ = exp( -R / (γ * λ_p) )\n\n### **2. Applying the Conditions**\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, N₁/N₀ = 1/3\n*   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our combined formula:\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 * λ_p) )\n\nTo solve for the unknown proper decay length (λ_p), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * λ_p)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / λ_p\nln(3) = 1.5 / λ_p\nThis gives us a relationship: `λ_p = 1.5 / ln(3)`. The proper decay length `λ_p` is an intrinsic property of the particle type and will be the same in the second scenario.\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, N₂/N₀ = 2/3\n*   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values in:\n2/3 = exp( -30 / (γ₂ * λ_p) )\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * λ_p)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * λ_p)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * λ_p)\n\nNow we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 30 / (λ_p * ln(3/2))\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nWe can substitute the expression for λ_p from Condition 1 into the equation for γ₂ from Condition 2:\nγ₂ = 30 / ( (1.5 / ln(3)) * ln(3/2) )\nγ₂ = (30 / 1.5) * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\nγ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\nNow, let's compute the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given value for gamma_1\ngamma_1 = 20\n\n# Calculate the values of ln(3) and ln(3/2)\nln3 = math.log(3)\nln1_5 = math.log(1.5)\n\n# Calculate gamma_2 using the derived formula\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * (ln3 / ln1_5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.19. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem involves relativistic particle decay. The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survives after traveling a distance `R` is given by the formula:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_p))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `N` is the number of surviving particles.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `R` is the distance traveled (the detector radius, 30 m).\n*   `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `τ_p` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\nThe term `c * τ_p` represents the proper decay length of the particle, let's call it `λ_p`. This is an intrinsic property of the particle type and remains constant. So the formula simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * λ_p))`\n\n**Step 1: Use the initial condition to find the ratio `R/λ_p`**\n\nWe are given:\n*   γ₁ = 20\n*   N/N₀ = 1/3\n*   R = 30 m\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * λ_p))`\n\nTo solve for the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * λ_p)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / λ_p`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / λ_p`\n\nFrom this, we find `λ_p = 1.5 / ln(3)`. The ratio `R/λ_p` is:\n`R/λ_p = 30 / (1.5 / ln(3)) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Step 2: Use the second condition to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂**\n\nNow we want to find the Lorentz factor, γ₂, for which `N/N₀ = 2/3`.\nUsing the same formula with the new values:\n`2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * λ_p))`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * λ_p)`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -R / (γ₂ * λ_p)`\n`ln(3) - ln(2) = R / (γ₂ * λ_p)`\n`ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * λ_p)`\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant ratio `R/λ_p`:\n1.  `R/λ_p = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `R/λ_p = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nBy setting them equal to each other, we can solve for γ₂:\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the numerical value**\n\nUsing the known values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54. This matches option D. The Python code executed in the thinking process confirms this calculation precisely: `54.19...`\n\n<<<D>>>"
