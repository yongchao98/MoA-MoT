    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Role of G2**\n\n*   The problem states that knocking out gene G2 (`g2` mutant) results in 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype observed, indicating G2 is essential for resistance.\n*   Now, let's look at the double mutants involving G2. The `g1g2` mutant also has 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance) is completely hidden or masked by the `g2` mutation.\n*   Similarly, the `g2g3` double mutant has 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance) is also completely masked by the `g2` mutation.\n*   This phenomenon, where the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the phenotype of another gene's mutation, is called **epistasis**. Specifically, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n*   In a biological pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to a downstream gene. Given the problem states one of the genes is a transcription factor (an upstream regulator), the gene whose mutation masks the others is the most likely candidate.\n*   **Conclusion 1:** G2 is a critical upstream gene, likely the transcription factor, whose function is required for G1 and G3 to contribute to resistance. This eliminates option B, which suggests G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship Between G1 and G3**\n\n*   Now, let's look at the mutants without the `g2` mutation: `g1`, `g3`, and `g1g3`.\n*   Resistance of `g1`: 75% (a 25% loss from the wild-type's 100%).\n*   Resistance of `g3`: 50% (a 50% loss from the wild-type).\n*   If G1 and G3 acted independently and additively, we would expect the double mutant (`g1g3`) to have a resistance loss equal to the sum of the individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75% loss. This would result in 100% - 75% = 25% remaining resistance.\n*   However, the experimental result for the `g1g3` double mutant is **10% resistance** (a 90% loss).\n*   The fact that the double mutant phenotype is much more severe than the simple sum of the single mutant phenotypes points to a **synergistic interaction**. This type of interaction is a hallmark of **gene redundancy**. This means that G1 and G3 perform similar or overlapping functions. When only one is removed, the other can still partially perform the required function, leading to a moderate phenotype. When both are removed, the function is almost completely lost, leading to a very severe phenotype.\n*   **Conclusion 2:** G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. They likely act in parallel, both contributing to the final resistance phenotype, and are both regulated by G2.\n*   Let's check the options based on this conclusion. Option A suggests \"pleiotropy,\" which is incorrect; pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, not how two genes interact for a single trait. Option C suggests they have the \"same promoter,\" which is plausible if they are both regulated by G2, but \"gene redundancy\" is a much better description of their functional relationship based on the phenotypes. Option D correctly identifies this relationship as gene redundancy.\n\n**3. Final Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** Incorrect. The data does not support pleiotropy; it supports redundancy.\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** Incorrect. G2, not G1, is the transcription factor.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** Plausible, but \"gene redundancy\" is a better functional description of the G1-G3 interaction than \"same promoter.\" The statement about epistasis between G1 and G3 is also less certain.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This is the best fit. It correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor based on epistasis and correctly identifies the synergistic relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 can be understood in the broad sense that their effects are not additive, which is true for redundant genes.\n\nTherefore, the data most strongly supports the conclusions in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
